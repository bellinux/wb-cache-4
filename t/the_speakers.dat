The council even transported ceremonial implements to conduct meetings with such as <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> chair and mace.

Although <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> discuss myriad topics, the flow of conversation always leads to supporting Holmes's Paris-taught conception of science and medicine and how they relate to morality and the mind.

5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument.

The audio emitted by <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the proper use}} and occurrence conditions of German tag questions, “oder, ” “ne, ” and “ja” and analyzes the characters of spoken language. It {{has been shown that}} tag questions are often used in informal situations where <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> asks for active communication. The proper use of German tag question is to show “empathy. ” “Oder” is used when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> is cooperative with the hearer, and <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> and <b>the</b> hearer share the same experience. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> asks empathy from the hearer and intention of the hearer is important. “Ne” is used when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> is cooperative with the hearer, and <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> and <b>the</b> hearer {{do not have the same}} experience. As for this use, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> insists his/her opinion, and the intention of both of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> and <b>the</b> hearer are important. “Ja” is used when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> is persuasive with the hearer, and <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> has confidence with his utterance and asks confirmation from the hearer; the intention of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> is important. These analyses suggest following three points, as the characters of the spoken language: (i) emotional distance between <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> and <b>the</b> hearer can be changed, (ii) affection influence the selection of “oder”, “ne”, and “ja”, which do not show affection directly, and (iii) by expressing affection, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> can indirectly indicate his/her intention and ask the hearer for action...|$|R
5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
