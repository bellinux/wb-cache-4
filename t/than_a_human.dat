5|$|In rural areas, law {{enforcement}} that operates outside of incorporated cities {{may also have}} mounted units. These include specially deputised, paid or volunteer mounted search and rescue units sent into roadless areas on horseback to locate missing people. Law enforcement in protected areas may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited. Horses can be {{an essential part of}} an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on foot, can transport heavy equipment, and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> can.|$|E

5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E

50|$|Spider-Man's bodily {{tissue is}} a great deal more durable and {{resistant}} to some types of injury <b>than</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>human</b> (for example, <b>a</b> regular <b>human</b> punched Spider-Man and broke his wrist). However, Spider-Man is far from invulnerable. While his body is tougher <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ordinary <b>human,</b> as seen several times in Spider-Man 2 (via falling from average web slinging height without sustaining significant injury), he can still be injured in ways comparable to <b>an</b> ordinary <b>human.</b> For example, Spider-Man can be injured by bullets or knives composed of conventional material and from impacts of sufficient force. However, if injured, his accelerated metabolism is capable of repairing itself many times faster <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ordinary <b>human.</b> <b>A</b> doctor has told Spider-Man that it would be impossible for a normal man to survive the punishment that he has endured.|$|R

50|$|Dire bats {{look like}} very large bats, {{and have a}} {{wingspan}} of between 8 and 9 feet. They have Blindsight, allowing them to 'see' in the dark. Because of this, their vision is effectively better <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>humans.</b> They also have keen ears, {{to make use of}} their ability. They can see regularly, but their normal vision is extremely weak.|$|R
25|$|The brain-to-body weight {{ratios of}} corvid brains {{are among the}} largest in birds, {{equal to that of}} most great apes and cetaceans, and only {{slightly}} lower <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human.</b> Their intelligence is boosted by the long growing period of the young.

25|$|For a {{human eye}} with {{excellent}} acuity, the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 CPD (1.2 arcminute per line pair, or a 0.35mm line pair, at 1 m). A rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 CPD.

25|$|Electromyography (EMG) is {{a method}} of {{detecting}} the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. This can be accomplished either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> hair). Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate {{to the level of}} muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force.|$|E
25|$|No taller <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> finger, fairy spae {{wives are}} usually {{dressed in the}} clothes of a peasant. However, when {{properly}} summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through runes, tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They {{are said to be}} descended from the erectors of the standing stones.|$|E

25|$|The bill itself {{contained}} no {{details on the}} type or amount of electricity that should be used and the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of determining these factors. In September 1888, a committee was formed and recommended 3000 volts, although the type of electricity, direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), was not determined, and since tests {{up to that point}} had been done on animals smaller <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> (dogs), some members were unsure that the lethality of AC had been conclusively proven.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the first}} heroic horses {{emerged from the}} silent film era, they were {{prominently}} featured in the B-Westerns of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. During {{the early decades of}} sound film, cowboy movies targeted a juvenile demographic. The film's heroes were generally one-dimensional, stock characters who represented and promoted truth and goodness to their young audience. More popular with adolescent viewers <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> sidekick, the Wonder Horse could not only outrun the mounts of the villains, but could also perform a series of feats and tricks to ensure that the cowboy hero would triumph.|$|E
25|$|Neural network {{research}} {{has resulted in}} three modern proprietary programs, JellyFish, Snowie and eXtreme Gammon {{as well as the}} shareware BGBlitz and the free software GNU Backgammon. These programs not only play the game, but offer tools for analyzing games and detailed comparisons of individual moves. The strength of these programs lies in their neural networks' weights tables, which are the result of months of training. Without them, these programs play no better <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> novice. For the bearoff phase, backgammon software usually relies on a database containing precomputed equities for all possible bearoff positions.|$|E

25|$|On May 8, PaveliÄ‡ {{ordered that}} the columns from NDH {{continue}} to Austria, {{and that they}} refuse to surrender to the advancing Communists, instead planning to surrender to the British. However, they were instead turned back in the mid-May Bleiburg repatriations, and many were subsequently killed by the Partisans. The sheer number of civilians slowed down the retreat, made the surrender unfeasible to the Allies, and ultimately led {{to the belief that}} they were nothing more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> shield to the Ustashe. For his abandonment of Croatian soldiers and civilians, later Croatian emigrants would accuse PaveliÄ‡ of cowardice.|$|E
25|$|Eyes {{in various}} animals show {{adaptation}} to their requirements. For example, {{the eye of}} a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> eye, and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation. The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry. Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, {{but this is not the}} case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show.|$|E
25|$|Pool {{designs for}} canine {{hydrotherapy}} vary, but most have generic elements. The pool {{tends to be}} smaller <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> swimming pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine hydrotherapy pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for lifting dogs {{in and out of}} the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.|$|E
