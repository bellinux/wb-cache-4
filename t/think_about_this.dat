We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
25|$|If {{desire is}} repressed, {{it is because}} every {{position}} of desire, no matter how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire is asocial, on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> desire is revolutionary in its essence — desire, not left-wing holidays! — and no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.|$|E
25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E

How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren.

Let's put {{one of them in}} the White House in Washington and the other in UC Berkeley (<b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

[...] Corbyn said [...] "I have no support for ISIS whatsoever, and obviously that should apply to someone who has committed crimes, but we should bear in mind that expressing a political point of view is not in itself an offence".

2500|$|The slot-and-state syntax in MCell {{can also}} be used to model multimeric {{proteins}} or macromolecular complexes. When used in this way, a slot is a placeholder for a subunit or a molecular component of a complex, and the state of the slot will indicate whether a specific protein component is absent or present in the complex. A way to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> is that MCell macromolecules can have several dimensions: A [...] "state dimension" [...] and one or more [...] "spatial dimensions". The [...] "state dimension" [...] is used to describe the multiple possible states making up a multi-state protein, while the spatial dimension(s) describe topological relationships between neighboring subunits or members of a macromolecular complex. One drawback of this method for representing protein complexes, compared to Meredys, is that MCell does not allow for the diffusion of complexes, and hence, of multi-state molecules. This can in some cases be circumvented by adjusting the diffusion constants of ligands that interact with the complex, by using checkpointing functions or by combining simulations at different levels.|$|E

2500|$|Over the {{following}} hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that {{ran into the}} early hours of {{the following}} morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had [...] "been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people", most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as [...] "male prostitutes", [...] "hustlers" [...] and [...] "liars" [...] whom he would give [...] "the rope trick". On other occasions, he stated he would wake up to find [...] "dead, strangled kids" [...] on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back. In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was [...] "crying, scared". As a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: [...] "Well, I can't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> right now.
