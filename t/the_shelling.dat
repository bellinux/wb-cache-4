5|$|Upon {{completion}} of this mission New Jersey steamed south, taking a position off Da Nang and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire {{support to the}} U.S. 1st Marine Division operating in the area. On 2 November New Jersey commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foliage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of <b>the</b> <b>shelling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the bunkers {{were never}} {{used in a}} real {{conflict}} during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that {{broke out in the}} 1990s. During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from <b>the</b> <b>shelling.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, New Mexico joined <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Tinian, {{and also}} bombarded Saipan and Guam. On 18 June, she helped drive away two air attacks. Later, on 20 June, she escorted {{transports}} off the Mariana Islands. Meanwhile, the carrier task force destroyed the Japanese carrier {{force at the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. Later, she escorted troop transports to the naval base of Eniwetok. On 9 July, she sailed to guard escort carriers until 12 July. Her guns later hit Guam on 21 July and kept on shelling the island until 30 July.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} its {{military}} accomplishment, Japan's international reputation was blackened by the Nanking Massacre, {{as well as by}} a series of international incidents that occurred during and after the battle. Most notable among them were <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> by Japanese artillery of the British steamship Ladybird on the Yangtze River on December 12, and the sinking by Japanese aircraft of the American gunboat Panay not far downstream on the same day. The Allison Incident, the slapping of an American consul by a Japanese soldier, further increased tensions with the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, the Soviets staged <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Mainila, an {{incident}} in which Soviet artillery shelled area near the Russian village of Mainila and then announced that a Finnish artillery attack had killed Soviet soldiers. The Soviet Union demanded that the Finns apologize for the incident and move their forces 20–25 kilometres from the border. The Finns denied any responsibility for the attack and rejected the demands, calling for a joint Finnish-Soviet commission to examine the incident. The Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, and used it {{as an excuse to}} withdraw from the non-aggression pact.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 June, the German XIII Corps began a massive heavy {{artillery}} bombardment against the Canadian positions. Nine-tenths of the Canadian forward reconnaissance battalion became casualties during the bombardment. 3rd Canadian Division commander Major-General Malcolm Mercer and 8th Canadian Brigade commander Brigadier-General Arthur Victor Seymour Williams had been conducting an inspection of the front line, when <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> began.

5|$|The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 8:15pm on 29 August, {{and began}} landing troops and supplies. While this {{was taking place}} the {{warships}} shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 11:30pm, had completed their landing. <b>The</b> <b>shelling</b> was not significant, however, and no casualties resulted from it. Throughout 30 August, the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid up in the jungle in preparation for an attack that night.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Montgomery, he was {{promoted}} to major general on December 9 for his victories at St. Johns and Montreal. After Montgomery was unable to convince Carleton to surrender, he placed several mortars a few hundred yards outside the walls of the city. <b>The</b> <b>shelling</b> of the city began on December 9, but after several days it had failed to make a serious impact on the walls, the garrison, or the civilian population. With <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> having little effect, Montgomery ordered the emplacement of another battery closer towards the city walls, on the Plains of Abraham, despite the fact it offered little natural cover from returning fire. On December 15, the new batteries were ready and Montgomery sent a party of men under the flag of truce to ask for the city's surrender. However, they were turned away. Montgomery then resumed firing on the city, but the effect was little better. When the new batteries were hit by more effective fire from the British, Montgomery ordered their evacuation.|$|E
5|$|As Japanese {{shelling}} intensifies in Burma, Chandrasekaran and Gnanasekaran {{decide to}} return to India. Chandrasekaran, accompanied by Saraswati, reaches Tiruchi safely and becomes a judge, but Gnanasekaran is lost in the journey and loses a leg in <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> before arriving in India. He begs for a living, forms an association for beggars and tries to reform them. Kalyani reaches Chandrasekaran's palatial house seeking food, but Chandrasekaran throws her out without recognising her. She later arrives at a temple seeking help, but the pujari (priest) also tries to molest her. Frustrated with life and unable to feed her child, Kalyani throws it into a river and attempts suicide, but is soon arrested for killing the child and brought for trial.|$|E

5|$|By 22:45 the {{crossroads}} had been secured by {{what remained of}} 'C' Company, the eighteen survivors of 'A' Company were in among the south-eastern buildings of Bréville. In the north-east of the village the twenty survivors of the Devonshire company had captured their objective. <b>The</b> <b>shelling</b> had stopped when 'B' Company reached the village unopposed and occupied abandoned German trenches beside the church. Fearing a German counter-attack on his weakened battalion, Parker ordered a defensive artillery bombardment. However, there was a misunderstanding when the order reached the artillery and a heavy bombardment landed on the British positions in the village, causing several casualties including three of the surviving officers.|$|E
5|$|During an {{overhaul}} in May 1942, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, {{she had her}} remaining secondary battery of twelve 5–inch/51 guns removed to make space for more anti-aircraft guns. After the overhaul, which was completed on 1 August, she departed San Francisco to Hawaii to prepare for action. From 6 December to 22 March 1943, she escorted convoys and transports to the Fiji Islands. After that, she patrolled the southwestern Pacific, before returning to Pearl Harbor {{to get ready for}} the Aleutian Islands Campaign. After her training, on 17 May, she steamed to Adak, which would be her base for the attack on Attu. She later participated in <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Kiska on 21 July, which preceded the Japanese evacuation of the island a week later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of World War II, Colorado {{undertook}} a defensive patrol near the Golden Gate Bridge in May 1942 to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to Fiji to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. On 24 July 1944, during <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Tinian, Colorado received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 November 1944 to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two Kamikazes which caused moderate damage.|$|E

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees were killed by <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah {{would be allowed to}} continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, an {{immediate}} vigil and protest {{was launched in}} light of international reports of <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to be nearly 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all vehicular traffic to a halt. The protesters, including {{women and children in}} strollers, said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> {{aircraft}} spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft {{fire to the}} extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.|$|E

5|$|Peng {{was still}} in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands {{off the coast of}} Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng {{developed}} a strategy with his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands' air and sea supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Sallal {{ordered that}} the {{military}} academy in San'a go on full alert— opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence as soon as <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the telephone exchange, Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security).|$|E
5|$|She joined {{other units}} {{going for the}} Mariana Islands at the harbor at San Francisco. She {{departed}} on 5 May passing Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein to the pre-invasion shelling at Saipan, Guam, and Tinian after 14 June. During <b>the</b> <b>shelling</b> of Tinian on 24 July she was damaged, 43 men were killed, and 198 wounded by 22 shell hits from Japanese shore batteries; she continued shelling the island and providing fire support for the invasion troops. After undergoing extensive repairs along the West Coast, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to begin the invasion of Leyte. A week after her arrival she was struck by two kamikaze suicide bombers, which killed 19 crewmembers, injured 72, and moderately damaged the ship. Despite the damage, she bombarded Mindoro on schedule from 12 to 17 January 1945. She then proceeded to Manus Island for urgent repairs.|$|E
