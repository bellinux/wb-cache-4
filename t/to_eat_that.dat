5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>that</b> {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E
500|$|Peng {{was born}} in 1898 {{in the village of}} Shixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan. His {{personal}} name at birth was [...] "Dehua". Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> <b>that</b> women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E

This city is thickly populated by people, of whom only the lead character Haroun and his parents are ever happy, {{while in the north}} of the city are factories wherein sadness is allegedly manufactured and exported. The factories produce air pollution that is only relieved during the monsoon, which also heralds the arrival of pomfret into the nearby waters. At the end of the book, it is revealed to be named Kahani, just like the moon in the story.|$|E
