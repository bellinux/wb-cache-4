40|$|Since March 2013, three {{waves of}} human {{infection}} with avian influenza A(H 7 N 9) virus {{have been detected}} in China. To investigate virus transmission within and across epidemic waves, we used surveillance data and whole-genome analysis of viruses sampled in Guangdong during 2013 - 2015. We observed a geographic shift of human A(H 7 N 9) infections from the second to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>waves.</b> Live poultry market interventions were undertaken in epicenter cities; however, spatial phylogenetic analysis indicated that the third-wave outbreaks in central Guangdong most likely resulted from local virus persistence rather than introduction from elsewhere. Although the number of clinical cases in humans declined by 35 % from the second to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>waves,</b> <b>the</b> genetic diversity of third-wave viruses in Guangdong increased. Our results highlight the epidemic risk to a region reporting comparatively few A(H 7 N 9) cases. Moreover, our results suggest that live-poultry market interventions cannot completely halt A(H 7 N 9) virus persistence and dissemination. 27869613 PMC 518913...|$|R
5|$|The second wave, {{scheduled}} for 06:35, consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry, {{as well as}} combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear the beach of obstacles. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave,</b> {{scheduled for}} 06:45, consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off the beach. It was to be followed at 06:37 by the fourth wave, which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions, assigned to clear the beach between {{the high and low}} water marks.|$|E
5|$|Two further {{attacks were}} made on Belgrade by the Germans {{on the first day}} of the invasion. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> struck at 14:00, {{consisting}} of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near Vienna, escorted by 60 fighters. This attack was confronted by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, who claimed four German aircraft shot down. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E

5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} around Broodseinde on 4 October, the 39th formed <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> of the 10th Brigade's attack, which went in around 6:00am. Following up the 37th and 38th Battalions, they advanced against strongly held pill-boxes towards the Gravenstafel Switch. After digging-in, a party from the 39th joined the 40th Battalion as it launched the final wave in the brigade's attack. As the 40th came up against stiff opposition, more {{men from the}} 39th were pushed forward and the objective was finally secured around 11:00am. After the battle, the 39th remained in the line until 6 October, when it was withdrawn back to Morbecque for reorganisation and rest. A couple of days later, the battalion was recommitted to {{the fighting}} and ordered to advance towards Passchendaele Ridge, attacking {{on the morning of}} 12 October despite heavy rain the previous evening. In the heavy fighting that followed, the battalion managed to secure its first objective, but was forced to withdraw when its flanks became threatened as neighbouring units had been unable to advance with them through the thick mud.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{action of}} D-Day was Operation Deadstick, a glider assault at 00:16 at Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal and the bridge (since renamed Horsa Bridge) over the Orne, {{half a mile}} (800 metres) to the east. Both bridges were quickly {{captured}} intact, with light casualties, {{by members of the}} 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course, and had to set up the navigation aids too far east. Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units. Major General Richard Gale arrived in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave</b> of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings. At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne.|$|E

A post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>wave's</b> ideology. Third-wave feminists often describe [...] "micropolitics", and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.|$|R
