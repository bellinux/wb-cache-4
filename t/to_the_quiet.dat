5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quiet,</b> seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> 2009 season, 2010 saw Hughes entering {{several different}} series. His season {{started with a}} retirement at the 8 Hours of Castellet, part of the LMS, driving for Quifel-ASM in a Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2 alongside Amaral and Olivier Pla. The next three races Hughes contested were {{all part of the}} FIA GT1 World Championship, driving Sumo Power GT's Nissan GT-R with Jamie Campbell-Walter, with the best result of those races being a victory at the RAC Tourist Trophy, held at Silverstone. Following these three events, he returned to the Quifel-ASM team for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, alongside Amaral and Pla. For the first time since his victory in 2005, Hughes was able to finish the race, taking seventh in class and 20th overall, although the race was by no means trouble free, due to an accident and a driveshaft failure. Following this event, Hughes returned to the GT1 championship with Sumo Power GT, at the Paul Ricard round, finishing eighth. He then returned to the LMS for the 1000 km of Algarve, this time driving a DAMS-entered Oreca FLM 09 alongside Firth, and finishing sixth overall, taking the Formula Le Mans class win. His next four events were split across the LMS and the GT1 series, with both GT1 entries being for Sumo Power GT, whilst he entered one event for RLR msport (in their MG EX265) and one for DAMS, with his best overall finish out of the four races coming at the Nürburgring round, where he and Campbell-Walter finished eighth, whilst his final LMS race of the season, the 1000 km of Silverstone, saw a 14th place overall, with a class win for Hughes and Firth. Following that race, he competed in the five remaining GT1 rounds for Sumo Power GT, with third at the Navarra round proving to be his best result out of those races. At the end of the season, Hughes and Campbell-Walter were classified 12th in the GT1 championship, whilst Hughes was also classified 12th in the FLM category of the LMS.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the first}} races in 1931 {{and the second}} regatta, held on Memorial Day, 1932, were marked by rough water on the river, which in later years led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> races being moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quieter</b> waters of Quincy Bay.

He had been dozing {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front screen door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, 1871, {{at the age}} of 19, {{she married}} Joseph H. Daniels, of Franklin, a member of one of the {{historic}} families of the neighborhood. Her travels in the U.S. have been extensive. She spent 20 winters in New York City, varied by trips to Washington, D.C., Bermuda and the West. Despite travel and the life of cities, her existence has been one of mental solitude. She has never found companionship of thought and labor. She has collected a library of a 1,000 volumes during 20 years, but they have been packed in boxes for 17 out of the 20. What she has done has been done alone, without books at hand, and usual incentives to new thought gained through literary intercourse. Her most-prized literary possession is a volume of more than three hundred letters from distinguished people all over the world, full of thanks and compliments for reviews and notes of themselves or their works. These attest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> life of high thinking and the constant energy in working. Daniels {{was a member of the}} American Folklore Society, and an original member of the Theosophical Society. She was a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.|$|E

40|$|Flight {{tests of}} the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation s Quiet Spike(TradeMark) {{hardware}} were recently completed on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Dryden Flight Research Center F- 15 B airplane. NASA Dryden uses a modified F- 15 B (836) airplane as a testbed aircraft to cost-effectively fly flight research experiments that are typically mounted underneath the airplane, along the fuselage centerline. For <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> Spike(TradeMark) experiment, instead of a centerline mounting, a forward-pointing boom was attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radar bulkhead of <b>the</b> airplane. <b>The</b> <b>Quiet</b> Spike(TradeMark) experiment is a stepping-stone to airframe structural morphing technologies designed <b>to</b> mitigate <b>the</b> sonic-boom strength of business jets flying over land. Prior <b>to</b> flying <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> Spike(TradeMark) experiment on the F- 15 B airplane several ground vibration tests were required <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> Spike(TradeMark) modal characteristics and coupling effects with the F- 15 B airplane. Because of flight hardware availability and compressed schedule requirements, a "traditional" ground vibration test of the mated F- 15 B Quiet Spike(TradeMark) ready-for-flight configuration did not leave sufficient time available for the finite element model update and flutter analyses before flight-testing. Therefore, a "nontraditional" ground vibration testing approach was taken.

40|$|We solve numerically {{the ideal}} MHD {{equations}} with an external gravitational field in 2 D in order <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> effects of impulsively generated linear and non-linear Alfvén waves into isolated solar arcades and coronal funnels. We analyze the region containing {{the interface between}} the photosphere and the corona. The main interest is <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> possibility that Alfvén waves triggers the energy flux transfer toward <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> solar corona and heat it, including the case that two consecutive waves can occur. We find {{that in the case}} of arcades, short or large, the transferred fluxes by Alfvén waves are sufficient <b>to</b> heat <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> corona only during a small lapse of time and in a certain region. In the case of funnels the threshold is achieved only when the wave is faster than 10 km/s, which is extremely high. We conclude from our analysis, that Alfvén waves, even in the optimistic scenario of having two consecutive Alfvén wave pulses, cannot transport enough energy as <b>to</b> heat <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> corona.
