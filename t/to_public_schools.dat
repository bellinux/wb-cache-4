5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students <b>to</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese that live in {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children <b>to</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools,</b> and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E

Commencing his working life as a coach and motor-body builder, he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World WarI. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook. He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later, having gained a reputation for his skill with timber, raised to sergeant and given command of the school's woodworking team.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) <b>to</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools.</b> Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered <b>to</b> <b>public</b> <b>schools</b> of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
