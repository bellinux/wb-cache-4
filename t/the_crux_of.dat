5|$|The film {{begins with}} an episode in 1279AD, when the {{successor}} of the last great Chola Emperor, pending invasion, sends his people to a mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a coolie {{and a member of}} the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture.

5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. <b>The</b> <b>crux</b> <b>of</b> the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at <b>the</b> <b>crux</b> <b>of</b> the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} ideas speak to <b>the</b> <b>crux</b> <b>of</b> Plato's Problem, which is how {{to account for the}} gap between {{knowledge}} and limited experience.

Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.|$|E

25|$|In linguistics, antisymmetry is {{a theory}} of {{syntactic}} linearization presented in Richard Kayne's 1994 monograph The Antisymmetry of Syntax. <b>The</b> <b>crux</b> <b>of</b> this theory is that hierarchical structure in natural language maps universally onto a particular surface linearization, namely specifier-head-complement branching order. The theory derives a version of X-bar theory. Kayne hypothesizes that all phrases whose surface order is not specifier-head-complement have undergone movements that disrupt this underlying order. Subsequently, {{there have also been}} attempts at deriving specifier-complement-head as the basic word order.|$|E

25|$|The 'doctrine of reserve' in the dialogues. There are {{numerous}} passages in the dialogues {{in which an}} especially important theme is introduced but then not further discussed. In many cases, the conversation breaks off just where it approaches <b>the</b> <b>crux</b> <b>of</b> the issue. These often concern questions which are of fundamental significance for philosophy. The defenders of the Tübingen School interpret these instances of 'reserve' as pointers {{to the content of}} the unwritten doctrines, which cannot be directly handled in written dialogues.|$|E

Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release <b>The</b> <b>Crux</b> <b>Of</b> The Biscuit in 2016.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cruxes</b> <b>of</b> Walter Benjamin’s work is {{the tension}} between an indebting and an expiating "memoria", i. e. the afflicting and the salvific insistence of history within the present moment. On the one hand, memory inscribes itself onto spaces and bodies in the violent and painful fashion of Kafka's "Penal Colony" apparatus. On the other hand, it can, {{in the form of}} rememoration ('Eingedenken'), sublate these very inscriptions. This sublation usually {{involves}} some form of redemptive, timely (re-) verbalization, but Benjamin’s conception of it varies. To gain a better insight into this inherent, varying tension, the article will {{take a closer look at}} the connection between pain, memory and law-positing violence in some Benjaminian texts, occasionally relating them to the historical background of his discussion...|$|R
