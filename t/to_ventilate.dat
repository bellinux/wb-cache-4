Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>ventilating</b> each lung via {{a separate}} ventilator {{is called the}} DuoVent(TM) approach. This system operates by connecting both ventilators to a master control unit (MCU), allowing for synchrony between the two ventilators.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E

25|$|Ludvig was {{a pioneer}} in the {{development}} of early oil tankers. He first experimented with carrying oil in bulk on single-hulled barges. Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, he faced a number of challenges. A primary concern was to keep the cargo and fumes well away from the engine room to avoid fires. Other challenges included allowing for the cargo to expand and contract due to temperature changes, and providing a method <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the tanks.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{years ago}} it was common {{practice}} to administer aerosol therapy <b>to</b> mechanically <b>ventilated</b> patients, with precious little research to help guide our practice. When a <b>ventilated</b> patient failed <b>to</b> respond to a bronchodilator aerosol treatment, it was all too common to just increase the frequency of therapy, with the rationale that, compared to the price of a ventilator day, a few extra aerosol treat-ments couldn’t hurt. The assumption was that the ventila-tor circuit and the endotracheal tube combined to form a “black hole ” that would draw aerosol in but not allow it to reach the patient. Early studies confirmed that suspi-cion, and many clinicians became rather cynical and har-bored low expectations for the therapeutic benefits of aero-sol delivery <b>to</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients. 1 – 4 Whereas with a normal, spontaneously breathing sub...|$|R
25|$|Starting in the 20th century, the {{technological}} requirements {{needed to build}} large crossings across the river were met. This was especially important by New York City, as the river is fairly wide at that point. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel opened between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan. The tunnel was the longest underwater tunnel {{in the world at}} the time, and used an advanced system <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the tunnels and prevent the build-up of carbon monoxide. The original upper level of the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel followed in the 1930s. In 1955, the original Tappan Zee Bridge was built over one of the widest parts of the river, from Tarrytown to Nyack.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged {{watertight}} {{door of the}} firemen's tunnel, the watertight door between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her flooding limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) with her first six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow {{for the type of}} expansion and contraction that other amniotes use <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached {{to the inside of the}} top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).|$|E
25|$|Natural {{disasters}} and man-made hazards can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. Emergency management often includes psychiatric emergency services {{designed to help}} victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria. Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals <b>to</b> <b>ventilate</b> to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon {{the scale of the}} disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.|$|E
