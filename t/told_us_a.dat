500|$|During writing, a Pixar {{employee}} noted to Jim Reardon that EVE was {{reminiscent of}} the dove with the olive branch from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage. WALL-E himself {{has been compared to}} Prometheus, Sisyphus, and Butades: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, Hrag Vartanian compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts. [...] "The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war. The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse. In the same way Stanton and his Pixar team have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through the prism of all types of relationships." ...|$|E
60|$|The old gentleman also <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{touching}} Indian legend or two--but {{not very}} powerful ones.|$|E
6000|$|... “Isn’t that {{a little}} rough on the effigy?” said Tony with a smile. “The man was, I think you <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>a</b> leader of shameless brigands.” ...|$|E
60|$|A shower {{came up in}} {{the evening}} and we had to stop picking. After the shower there was a {{magnificent}} double rainbow. We watched it from the granary window, and the Story Girl <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> old legend, culled from one of Aunt Olivia's many scrapbooks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've only <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about <b>a</b> hundred times,' {{said the}} Babe brutally. 'I tell you what, though, he'll score off you if he finds {{you going to}} Rutton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] said Friedel, [...] "I cannot but {{remember}} that the Genoese merchant of old <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of <b>a</b> German noble sold by his foes to the Moors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother," [...] said Dwight, [...] "I am {{sure you}} have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good many times that we must never say any thing unless we are sure it is true." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Jardine laughed. [...] "I was {{interested}} in the man. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good deal about himself, although it would have embarrassed him if he'd guessed. The curious thing is that he imagines he's practical, while he's really a reckless sentimentalist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{declared}} Evelyn; [...] "that {{would be}} most ungrateful. I only expected a more characteristic example of sea cookery. After what Mr. Vane <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>a</b> lunch like the one you provided, with glass and silver, struck me as rather an anachronism." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{he spoke}} to us of notes with vibrato or expression, he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> with <b>a</b> mysterious air that these notes, forte or piano, seemed to come from within himself. One had the {{impression}} that they came directly from the heart or soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't very much, anyway," [...] {{said the}} other man. [...] "Tom didn't want to come in; <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he'd <b>a</b> message for you. But we made him, and were sorry after, because when he got started he left us very little whisky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, alas, I {{chose to}} rust out, and here I am, a miserable, {{worthless}} thing, whom {{no one can}} use or care for. Lift the ruffle, and behold a sad contrast to the faithful, honest, happy Granny, who has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> such <b>a</b> varied tale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wasn't he! I {{have not}} done {{laughing}} yet. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> story about the little Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an Indian screen. Killing! Get him to tell it you. The richest thing you ever heard!' ...|$|E
60|$|Near by {{the abbey}} is a square, modern mansion, {{belonging}} to the Earl of Buchan, at present untenanted. There were some black, solemn yew trees there, {{old enough to have}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> deal of history had they been inclined to speak; as it was, they could only drizzle.|$|E
6000|$|A day or {{two after}} that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, and he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good deal about {{the country and the}} Gregory Diggings. He seemed a very {{entertaining}} person and a man well posted in the affairs of Colorado. By and by he remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|When our {{men went}} into their huts, it was surprising, indeed, {{to see the}} vast stock of wealth they had got, in gold and silver and jewels, which, however, they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> was <b>a</b> trifle to what Captain Avery had, {{wherever}} he was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} are {{speaking}} {{of them as}} far as they have been <b>told</b> to <b>us.</b> <b>As</b> far as they go,--unless they can be upset and shown not to be facts,--I fear they would be conclusive to me on a jury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} at him all the evening," [...] said Miss O'Callaghan, [...] "and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he had <b>a</b> dreadful cold and couldn't sing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Mr. Hans said {{yesterday}} that you thought so much of others you hardly wanted anything for yourself. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> wonderful story of Buddha giving himself to the famished tigress to save her and her little ones from starving. And he said you were like Buddha. That is what we all imagine of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on," [...] protested Upton. [...] "You haven't <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{thing about}} the woods or what luck you've had trapping, or what has become of Alec Smith, or {{what we are going}} to do if we go up there, or who your partner is. Now fire away and we'll make plans afterward. What are the woods like now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|About [...] "the {{mechanism}} of genius" [...] in Tennyson Mr Palgrave has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little; more appears incidentally in his biography. [...] "It {{was his way}} that when we had entered on some scene of special beauty or grandeur, after enjoying it together, he should always withdraw wholly from sight, and study the view, as it were, in a little artificial solitude." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{paddling}} up, he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>a</b> canoe {{had arrived}} overnight, from Papeetee, with {{an order from}} a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon, {{he wanted us to}} assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not," [...] said Robin; [...] "you don't {{see other}} girls' rooms. Look at yours at Cambridge. Malooney <b>told</b> <b>us</b> you'd had <b>a</b> fire, {{and we all}} {{believed}} him at first." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{supplies the}} survey and script used in the usability tests for the article "Side by side: What a comparative usability study <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about <b>a</b> web site redesign", which {{will appear in the}} Journal of Web Librarianship. The script and survey will not appear in the article itself. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] he said, [...] "this is my village, {{and it is}} by my {{permission}} your Headman rules here. Now, this stranger has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> thing which appears impossible. We have not heard anything like it from a white man before, but when a man would deceive you he is careful {{to tell you what}} you can believe." ...|$|E
60|$|To Simon Kenton, however, {{this sort}} of work {{was by no means}} new. He had been besieged many times, as we knew from the stories the young man <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> short time previous; but I ventured to say that never before had he been pitted against the painted foes with so small a force, and in a place where it was not {{probable}} any help could come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our new parson told me, {{and he is}} in {{my opinion}} a good authority, {{because he is a}} Christian, if ever a man was; and he is an elderly man, besides being uncommonly clever and well informed. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> great many strong facts at the temperance meeting we held last night. I wish you had been there, Miles. It would have warmed your heart, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Purvis, [...] "married, {{and with}} five dear boys and three dear girls." [...] The eight of them, he <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> were <b>a</b> great blessing. So, too, was his wife--a great social worker, it seemed, {{in the cause}} of women's rights and a marvellous {{platform}} speaker in the temperance crusade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gramercy for the {{few drops}} of thy sprinkling," [...] replied De Bracy; [...] "but this damsel hath wept enough to {{extinguish}} a beacon-light. Never was such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, {{since the days of}} St Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer <b>told</b> <b>us.</b> [30] <b>A</b> water-fiend hath possessed the fair Saxon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vex {{not your}} mind on that," [...] the prince answered, smiling. [...] "We {{have had a}} citizen from Montauban here this very day, who <b>told</b> <b>us</b> such <b>a</b> tale of sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood; but our wrath was turned upon {{the man who was}} in {{authority}} over them." ...|$|R
60|$|MacShaughnassy {{having had}} his innings, Jephson took a turn, and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> pathetic {{story about an}} unfortunate mongrel that was run over in the Strand one day and its leg broken. A medical student, who was passing at the time, {{picked it up and}} carried it to the Charing Cross Hospital, where its leg was set, and where it was kept and tended until it was quite itself again, when it was sent home.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{owner of}} the farm is a Boer, mother, and as he <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>a</b> rebel. As he began the affair by putting a bullet through my hat, and abusing us and our nation heartily, we took the liberty of searching his house, with good success. I need not say {{that he did not}} give us this bread and the pail of milk of his own free-will, but I left the money for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He knew {{perfectly}} well, Ruth; he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long story, but I {{will not}} {{tell you what it}} is now. We shall be at Mr. Volkes's in a minute, and we shall find Mr. Vickery there, and I want you to tell us what you know about it before you hear what Mr. Carne's story was. I do hope that you will tell us everything you know. Only in that way can we clear Captain Mervyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There! Do you {{see that}} Crowded Owl {{following}} us? He's been hanging round us all the afternoon. He's up to something. Don't you remember the captain <b>told</b> <b>us</b> he was <b>a</b> bad-tempered fellow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He yarns good," [...] said Tom Platt. [...] "T'other {{night he}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> abaout <b>a</b> kid {{of his own}} size steerin' a cunnin' little rig an' four ponies up an' down Toledo, Ohio, I think 'twas, an' givin' suppers to a crowd o' sim'lar kids. Cur'us kind o' fairy-tale, but blame interestin'. He knows scores of 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "It is {{very good}} of you, and if we stay at Esquimault I will come up and spend {{a day or two}} among the deer. Atkinson <b>told</b> <b>us</b> what <b>a</b> good time he had with you, but we were a trifle {{astonished}} to see the fine wapiti head he brought back with him." ...|$|R
