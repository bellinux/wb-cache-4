40|$|Building a {{parametric}} {{cost model}} is hard work. The data is noisy and often does not behave like {{we want it}} to. We need statistics to give us {{an indication of the}} goodness of our models, but; statistics can be manipulated and mislead. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> our own very human biases can lead us astray; causing us to see patterns in the noise and draw false conclusions from the data. Yet, it is the data itself that is the foundation for making better cost estimates and cost models. I believe the mistake we often make is we believe that our models are representative of the data; that our models summarize the experiences, the knowledge, and the stories contained in the data. However, it is the opposite that is true. Our models are but imitations of reality. They give us trends, but not truth. The experiences, the knowledge, and the stories that we need in order to make good cost estimates is bound up in the data. You cannot separate good cost estimating from a knowledge of the historical data. One final thought. It is our attempts to make sense out of the randomness that leads us astray. In order to make progress as cost modelers and cost estimators, we must accept that there are real limitations on our ability to model the past and predict the future. I do not believe we should throw up our hands and say this is the best we can do. Rather, to see real improvement we must first recognize these limitations, avoid the easy but misleading solutions, and seek to find ways to better model the world we live in. I don't have any simple solutions. Perhaps the answers lie in better data or in a totally different approach to simulating how the world works. All I know is that we must do our best to speak truth to ourselves and our customers. Misleading ourselves and our customers will, in the end, result in an inability to {{have a positive impact on}} those we serve...|$|R

However, the notion of temporal constraints, controlling the system behavior over time, has not been natively supported.

On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them are based on temporal logics that require particular skills {{to be used in}} practice. In this paper, we propose to fill in both gaps.

Backward {{extrusion}} (it is {{also called}} indirect extrusion) is an extrusion {{process in which}} the billet is placed in the container cavity, and where the movement of the punch is in the opposite direction to the movement of the flow of the metal. In this work the backward extrusion were applied on a nanostructured material. the extruded material were three types of nanostructured Al- 6082 alloy Pass 1, pass 4 (route C), pass 8 (route C) which are produced by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP), in addition to the annealed Al- 6082 material. The experimental results show that the pass 8 (route C) has the maximum value of extrusion loads and high value of hardness. From the finite element simulation it observed that the maximum value of equivalent strain was when the pass 4 material was used, while the equivalent strain of pass 1 and pass 8 seem to be equal and that the maximum flow stress was obtained when the pass 8 material was used.
