40|$|Abstract—From {{teaching}} in labs to training for assembly, {{a key role}} that robots are expected to play is to instruct their users in completing physical tasks. While task instruction requires {{a wide range of}} capabilities, such as effective use of verbal and nonverbal language, a fundamental requirement for an instructional robot is to provide its students with task instructions in a way that maximizes their understanding of and performance in the task. In this paper, we present an autonomous instructional robot system and investigate how different instructional strategies affect user performance and experience. We collected data on human instructor-trainee interactions in a pipe-assembly task. Our analysis identified two key instructional strategies: (1) grouping instructions together and (2) summarizing the outcome of subsequent instructions. We implemented these strategies into a humanlike robot that autonomously instructed its users in the same pipe-assembly task. To achieve autonomous instruction, we also developed a repair mechanism that enabled the robot to correct mistakes and misunderstandings. An evaluation of the instructional strategies in a human-robot interaction study showed that employing the grouping strategy resulted in faster task completion and increased rapport with the robot, although it also increased the number of <b>task</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Our model of in-structional strategies and study findings offer strong implications for the design of instructional robots.

It is expected that in a highly networked environment the sheer magnitude of communication traffic amid multiple tasks could overwhelm the individual soldier. Key cognitive bottlenecks constrain information flow {{and the performance of}} decision-making, especially under stress. The Honeywell team, sponsored by the DARPA Augmented Cognition Program, is focusing primarily on varieties of the Attention Bottleneck: tonic arousal required for vigilance and divided attention across multiple <b>tasks.</b> <b>Breakdowns</b> in attention lead to multiple problems: failure to notice an event in the environment, failure to distribute attention across a space, failure to switch attention to highest priority information, or failure to monitor events over a sustained period of time. The appropriate allocation of attention is important to U. S.

Within memory, interference does not arise {{as a result of the}} conflict between the contents of memory and the irrelevant sound, since neither phonological nor semantic similarity predicts its extent. Instead, the interference seems to be a product of the similarity in process - the degree of seriation - between rehearsal in short-term memory and the perceptual organization of the irrelevant sound.

However, the design of training in the rail and mining industries is extremely underserved {{in the area of}} mentoring in comparison with other domains. As two distributed industries that have extreme synergies at the sharp end, mentoring may help overcome the shortage of skilled and experienced workers in these domains in Australia. This paper outlines an argument for mentoring in the rail and mining sector, specifically as a strategy that may enhance the learning experience for the train driving and haul truck operation tasks where simulator-based training has been well established in varying degrees of sophistication. First, it provides an overview of the basic elements that underlie the knowledge requirements and core competencies of training for the train driver and haul truck operator.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the nature of affect processing deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through administration {{of a series of}} affect perception and interpretation tasks. Three tasks involved perceptual classification of emotional stimuli: (1) discrimination of face identity, (2) discrimination of genuine emotions from facial grimaces that did not conform to recognizable emotional expressions, and (3) discrimination of facial affect expressions. Tasks assessing (1) verbal identification of facial affect, (2) labeling of situational affect, and (3) matching facial affect photographs to emotions depicted in complex scenes, were used to investigate the integrity of more complex, semantic-associative processes in AD. Twenty adults with neurologic diagnoses of AD and 18 healthy control subjects participated in the study. The ability of AD patients to perform fundamental face processing tasks supported the hypothesis that basic perceptual classification functions may be spared in mild to moderate stages of AD. In contrast, AD patients were differentially impaired on associative affect <b>tasks,</b> suggesting <b>breakdowns</b> in processes relying upon the activation of higher-order, emotion-specific semantic representations. The integrity of a hierarchical model of face processing abilities was assessed by comparing the actual distribution of subjects' scores to three theoretical distributions. As predicted, the hierarchical model reflected the best 'goodness-of-fit' with both AD and control distributions. Evidence that AD patients were able to benefit from emotional cues on a task requiring subjects to match facial affect expressions to emotional scenes was interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that primary stores of affect knowledge are preserved in AD, but may be severely disorganized or inefficiently accessed. These findings were interpreted in terms of emotional semantics and their relationship to information processing models of facial affect recognition. Finally, no statistical relationship between affect processing variables and caregiver burden was found in the present study. The need for future studies to clarify the nature of semantic competency for affect processing in AD, and to provide a greater understanding of caregiver burden and its relationship to the emotional behavior of neurologically impaired adults, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Word-picture {{matching}} tasks {{have been}} widely used to assess semantic processing in aphasia, but as yet have received little critical evaluation. Successful performance on a word-picture matching task employs several components of the language-processing system, including lexical and semantic processing of word stimuli and the visual and semantic processing of picture stimuli. Hence it is not only semantic impairments that can affect performance on this <b>task</b> - <b>breakdown</b> in processing at any point from early auditory or visual processing of the word or visual perception of the pictures can affect accuracy. Consequently, performance on a word-picture matching task might be affected by psycholinguistic variables that pertain to any of these levels of processing, such as imageability, word length, word frequency, and the relationship of the distractors to the target. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting word-picture matching performance, using {{one of the most widely}} used word-picture matching tasks (Subtest 47, Spoken word-picture matching, from PALPA; Kay, Lesser, & Coltheart, 1992). Methods and Procedures: The performance and error patterns of 54 participants with aphasia and 51 elderly control participants, who had completed spoken word-picture matching (subtest number 47) from PALPA, were evaluated. Correlation and regression analyses were used to investigate effects of psycholinguistic variables on performance (frequency, imageability, number of phonemes, semantic and visual similarity, and word association). Outcomes and Results: No variable was found to significantly affect control performance, due to ceiling effects. Imageability, semantic similarity, and word association affected the aphasic participant group performance. Six of the individuals with aphasia showed a significant effect on performance of at least one of four variables; imageability, semantic similarity, frequency, and word association. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that three psycholinguistic variables significantly affect the performance of both the group with aphasia and some individual participants with aphasia. It suggests that accuracy can be influenced not only by the nature of the relationship of the stimuli within the test but also by the individual level of language processing breakdown. Clinicians and researchers need to be mindful of this when using word-picture matching as the basis of their assessment of semantic processing in aphasia. 26 page(s...|$|R

In many cases these plans exist only in textual form and have to be broken down into discrete actions with significant manual effort. This paper presents a tool called “Collaborative Task Manager ” (CTM), which enables modeling, exchange, and reuse of user-defined task structures, derived from such plans in an easy-to-use manner. Users ’ working tasks can be created and managed ad-hoc in hierarchical action lists in the individual users ’ workspaces. Users can further delegate tasks over email. Individual actions on tasks in the personal workspaces and task delegations are tracked on a central server, to integrate the personal task hierarchies of all process participants to end-to-end processes. This enables transparency into parties involved in a process, their tasks, and the status thereof. Reuse of process experience is enabled through so called “task patterns”. These can be extracted from executed ad-hoc processes or created from scratch as best-practice recommendations.

Experiment 1 investigated use of the Diapix Task as a measure of communication effectiveness in noise.

Communication effectiveness was measured by counting communication breakdowns. Results indicated that the <b>Task</b> did elicit <b>breakdowns</b> and, out of nine picture pairs, one elicited a different amount of breakdowns than the others; this pair was excluded.

40|$|Objective: To help mine {{safety and}} health {{professionals}} manage and reduce hazardous noise exposure with a software tool that simplifies the record-keeping and analysis process. Background: Hearing loss resulting from overexposure to noise {{continues to be a}} problem throughout the U. S. mining industry. Studies indicate that 70 %- 90 % of all miners have a noise-induced hearing loss severe enough to be classified as a hearing disability by the time they reach retirement age. To address this problem, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed the Determination of Sound Exposures (DOSES) software program. DOSES is designed specifically for use by mine management and safety personnel to simplify the record-keeping and analysis associated with time-motion studies, making it easier to identify and solve noise exposure problems. Approach: DOSES relies on time-motion study data that profile a worker's daily activities. In this case, that information is the <b>task</b> and location <b>breakdown</b> of a worker's regular working routine. In addition, as task and location data are noted, associated sound levels are collected using a dosimeter or sound level meter. The data are then entered into the program (Figure 1) as complete observations made of the following parameters: 1. Start time; 2. Stop time; 3. Task name; 4. Task location; 5. Sound level. With the time-motion and sound level data entered into the program, analysis is moved from the clipboard to the computer where extensive analysis of the worker's noise exposure over time can be conducted. Results: DOSES assesses noise exposure by analyzing the time-motion study data of a worker's daily schedule broken down by task and location. This analysis is shown visually on the main screen in tabular form and as a plot of the cumulative dose and observed sound level over time as each observation from the time study is entered. As each entry is completed, the percent noise exposure is calculated using one of three formulas chosen by the user (Table 1). Once the study is completely entered, a more in-depth analysis is performed where cumulative exposures by task and location are calculated and displayed in tables (Figure 2) and bar graphs (Figure 3). If a dosimeter was used during the time study, the dosimeter log file can be imported into the program for comparison to the observation-based results. Customizable reports from the data can be generated and printed or saved in HTML format. With these analysis capabilities, high noise exposure aspects of the job can be easily identified by task or location, allowing the safety officer to mitigate them with engineering or administrative noise controls. The raw time study observation data can also be exported in comma-separated ASCII format for easy use by other programs. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "July 2009.

The iterative design process we employed included the following five basic steps: 1) identification of the limitations affecting the usage of different modalities in various contexts (contextual observations and context analysis) 2) identifying and selecting suitable interaction concepts and creating a general design for the multimodal application (storyboarding, use cases, interaction concepts, <b>task</b> <b>breakdown,</b> application UI and interaction design), 3) creating modality-specific UI designs, 4) rapid prototyping and 5) evaluating the prototype in naturalistic situations to find key issues to be taken into account in the next iteration.

40|$|Each {{year in the}} United States 2. 5 {{million people}} sustain a {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), making TBI {{one of the leading}} causes of death and disability. Difficulty self-regulating behavior is considered a hallmark deficit of TBI and can impede positive rehabilitation outcomes. Traditional clinic-based assessments with TBI cohorts are often compromised due to inaccurate self-reporting caused by self-awareness and/or memory challenges. This project developed out of the need for more adequate and objective assessment methods of behavior after TBI. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify physiological states that may serve as real world, real-time prodromes of behavioral dysregulation when compared to direct behavioral observation during task performance. Adults with TBI (N= 14) were asked to complete a protocol of challenging, problem-solving tasks selected due to their potential to elicit negative responses believed to be indicative of dysregulation and result in <b>task</b> <b>breakdown</b> behaviors. Participants wore a portable biosensor band throughout the completion of all research tasks, which allowed for continuous physiological recordings of heart rate, breathing rate, and heart rate variability. Physiology was then synchronized with post hoc behavioral ratings conducted by trained clinicians from video recordings and analyzed through hierarchical linear mixed model methods to assess both between- and within-subject contribution related to the outcome. Testing was conducted at ReMed of Pittsburgh, a community-based brain injury rehabilitation program. This study was funded in part through the National Science Foundation’s Integrative Graduate Education & Research Traineeship (IGERT) Program in the Department of Rehabilitation Science & Technology and the School of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences Dean’s Research Development Fund, all at the University of Pittsburgh...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis was mainly chosen, because in recent years {{many areas of the}} Czech Republic were {{repeatedly}} affected by floods of varying intensity and the police were forced to coordinate rescue and relief work with other units of the integrated rescue system (IRS). In practice performance-related police tasks were influenced by the quality of preparations (especially planning documentation) and decisions of the persons, who are entrusted with the rights and duties of coordinating the intervening units activities. At the same time no document, that deals with the issue, has been processed so far. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part is divided into three subsections. The first one aims to familiarize the reader with basic <b>tasks,</b> history, organizational <b>breakdown</b> and legislation governing the activities of the police. The second one examines ispecially the role of the integrated rescue system, its components, process and the role of emergency planning and related legislation. The last subchapter is devoted to crisis management, its bodies, related legislation and crisis planning. The practical part consists of a list of basic police tasks, which was created by analyzing documents prepared in the emergency and crisis planning for the capital city of Prague district. The police competences determined by the applicable effective legislation were subsequently applied to tasks of the list. The result of the above process was the finfing, which specific rules regulate the various police tasks, what specific permissions are officers abble to use to accomplish the task and where are the limits of their options. The aim of this thesis is to create a comprehensive document, that would contain the legal powers of the police and was especially useful in the practice of entities involved in the processing of emergency and crisis plans (including practical examples of the application of individual rights). In this context, there were formulated the following research questions: Suffers legislation of competencies of the Police of the Czech Republic from fragmentation (are the rights and obligations scattered in a number of legal norms) ? Are police powers sufficient to perform all the tasks, which are imposed to this unit of the IRS by emergency and crisis plans processed for the capital city of Prague? The results of the thesis have shown that the legislation of the police activities is based on the amount of generally binding legal regulations, which are supplemented by internal regulations of the Ministry of Interior and the police themselves. Although the internal regulations don't have general applicability, they affect the performance of police tasks in practice as well. The fragmentation of legislation may cause an incorrect assessment of the police competencies by the bodies that are involved in emergency and crisis planning. By the coordination of the integrated rescue system activities, this documentation becomes one of the sources for decisions of incident commander or crisis management authority, resp. person standing at the head (especially the mayor or governor). In most cases these persons will not be experts in all relevant spheres and they will logically follow the documentation of the integrated rescue system, or documentation of crisis management. The quality of this documentation (or, conversely, lack thereof) will have practical impact on the success of the management of emergency events or crisis situations. Analysis of current documentation processed in the emergency and crisis planning for the capital city of Prague has shown, that most of the tasks assigned to the police corresponds to their competencies. There were also recorded some tasks that do not belong to the police competences. It involves the sorting of injured people by the START method and their transport to medical facilities by police vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Kittusamy (Kittusamy & Buchholz, 2004) {{state that}} there have been few studies {{conducted}} to assess exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) in the construction industry. They suggest that there is very little reliable data from the construction industry that characterizes exposure levels to various hazards including WBV or the health outcomes from such exposure {{and that there is a}} need for more exposure data. In a recent exploratory study of heavy construction equipment Cann (Cann, Salmoni, Vi, & Eger, 2003) looked at vibration levels for 14 different types of construction equipment. Eight of the 14 pieces of equipment tested exposed operators to levels of WBV that exceeded the recommended limits for an 8 -hour period when comparing the measured VDV to the ISO 2631 - 1 standards. The purpose of the present research was not only to test a larger number of scrapers but also to investigate scraper operator exposure to whole body vibration (WBV) separately for each task. Methods 33 scrapers were evaluated for WBV in a variety of residential and road construction projects. Testing equipment consisted of triaxial accelerometers that allowed vibration data collection in all three orthogonal axes, with the x-axis positioned to measure vibration in the anterior-posterior direction, the y-axis in the medial-lateral direction, and the z-axis in the vertical direction. Root mean square accelerations (aRMS), vibration dose value (VDV), crest factor, and maximum transient vibration values (MTVV) were derived from this software and exported to an Excel 22 ̆ 01 e 2 spreadsheet for later data analysis. Test sessions for each piece of equipment lasted for approximately 20 minutes until at least three work cycles had been completed. Tasks included: idling while waiting for a bulldozer to push the scraper through the scraping phase, scraping, traveling loaded with dirt, dumping and traveling empty.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{agitated}} behaviours {{that accompany}} dementia (e. g. pacing, aggression, calling out) are stressful to both {{nursing home residents}} and their carers and are difficult to treat. Behaviours stemming from pain, major depression or psychosis benefit from treatment with analgesics, antidepressants or antipsychotics. In other cases, psychotropic medications have limited efficacy but are used very widely. Therefore, increasingly more {{attention has been paid}} to nonpharmacological interventions which are associated with fewer risks. The aim of the current study is to test if personalised one-to-one interaction activities based on Montessori principles will reduce the frequency of behavioural symptoms of dementia significantly more than a relevant control condition. Methods/Design We will conduct a controlled trial with randomised cross-over between conditions. Persons with moderate to severe dementia and associated behavioural problems living in aged care facilities will be included in the study. Consented, willing participants will be assigned in random order to Montessori or control blocks for two weeks then switched to the other condition. Montessori activities derive from the principles espoused by Maria Montessori and subsequent educational theorists to promote engagement in learning, namely <b>task</b> <b>breakdown,</b> guided repetition, progression in difficulty from simple to complex, and the careful matching of demands to levels of competence. The control intervention consists of conversation or reading from and looking at pictures in a newspaper to control for non-specific benefits of one-to-one interaction. Presence of target behaviour will be noted as well as level of engagement and type of affect displayed. Secondary measures also include the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory and information on time and funds spend to prepare the activities. Discussion If our results show that use of Montessori activities is effective in treating challenging behaviours in individuals with dementia, it will potentially provide a safer and more enjoyable intervention rather than reliance on pharmacology alone.
