5|$|For Galileo, <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> {{were caused}} by the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Most {{birds are}} diurnal, but some birds, such as {{many species of}} owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during {{twilight}} hours), and many coastal waders feed when <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> are appropriate, by day or night.|$|E

5|$|Between the Times and <b>the</b> <b>Tides</b> charted in four {{countries}} upon its release. It reached number 79on the Belgian Albums Chart in Flanders, number 149on the French Albums Chart and number 92on the German Albums Chart. In the U.S, the album peaked at number 13on Billboards Heatseeker Albums chart and number 24on the Tastemaker Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. <b>The</b> <b>tides</b> and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
50|$|LSU showed life late after Henry lost {{a fumble}} at <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> 22. <b>The</b> Tigers marched 22 yards in four plays with Fournette scoring on a one-yard run with 9:18 on the clock. The extra-point {{was blocked by}} <b>the</b> <b>Tide's</b> A'Shawn Robinson as <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> held a 30-16 lead.|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} found for expressing <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> current {{velocities}} in terms of <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> height (with all variables expanded in spherical harmonics). All time equations were then combined into a single, nondifferential matrix equation involving only <b>the</b> unknown <b>tide</b> height. <b>The</b> pole <b>tide</b> was constrained so that no tidewater flows across continental boundaries. The constraint was derived for the case of turbulent oceans; with <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> velocities {{expressed in terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> height. <b>The</b> two matrix equations were combined. Simple matrix inversion then yielded the constrained solution. Programs to construct and invert the matrix equations were written. Preliminary results were obtained and are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Eileanan Chearabhaigh are {{a complex}} group of islets off {{the east coast}} of Benbecula, the area of which changes as <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> rise and fall. The total area is circa 49 {{hectares}} and largest part that might be considered to be a genuine island is circa 32 hectares.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{astronomer}} from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived {{a century after}} Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus {{was the first to}} prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi.|$|E
5|$|Between the Times and <b>the</b> <b>Tides</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock musician Lee Ranaldo, released on March 20, 2012on Matador Records. His first release on Matador Records and since Sonic Youth's indefinite hiatus, the album features a more straightforward songwriting approach to his prior material and includes guest musicians such as Nels Cline, John Medeski and Leah Singer. The album was {{originally intended to}} be a minimalist acoustic album but its sound was developed by Ranaldo during its recording at Echo Canyon West in Hoboken, New Jersey during a seven-month period in early 2011.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tide</b> took <b>the</b> second-half kickoff and {{immediately}} mounted a scoring drive with Lewis {{back in the}} game. They drove 66 yards in 8 plays, capped off by an 8-yard TD run by RB Paul Ott Carruth. A two-point conversion attempt failed and <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> now had <b>the</b> lead at 19-14. Alabama then forced a 3-and-out by Auburn, but a Lewis Colbert punt pinned <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> back at their own 5. Undaunted, <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> drove all <b>the</b> way to the 1-yard line in 15 plays eating up 8:27 of clock, but the drive stalled and Kim hit a chip-shot 18-yard field goal to increase <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> lead to 22-14 with 1:19 left in the 3rd.|$|R
50|$|The way to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} tidal flow at the narrows is to observe the direction in which <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> is flowing. If the tidal flow is heading toward theJervis Inlet then <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> is going out (low <b>tide).</b> But if <b>the</b> flow is moving toward Princess Louisa Inlet <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> it is coming in (high tide).|$|R
5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect <b>the</b> <b>tides,</b> and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|Further north, the {{hurricane}} threatened to strike or move {{very close to}} the Outer Banks. Hurricane warnings were posted from Cape Hatteras to Manteo, and ships were advised to remain at port. Hurricane How produced 50mph (80km/h) winds and high tides along the Outer Banks and southeastern Virginia. Some minor damage was reported, and two ships were washed ashore. In New England, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Portland, Maine, with rains, fog, and heavy surf reported. Several roads were closed in Massachusetts due to <b>the</b> <b>tides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ranaldo {{promoted}} Between the Times and <b>the</b> <b>Tides</b> release with a 28-date tour {{throughout the}} United States and Europe, with Wilco, Disappears and M. Ward supporting. The tour began on April 10, 2010at The Satellite in Los Angeles, California and concluded on August 3at the Highland Bowl in Rochester, New York. In October, Ranaldo performed three shows in Australia at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney on October 20, The Zoo in Brisbane on October 21and at The Hi-Fi on October 24, {{as part of}} the Melbourne Festival. Local Australian bands Pony Face and We All Want To supported Ranaldo's performances in Sydney and Brisbane.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Chesapeake <b>Tide</b> were {{a former}} {{professional}} Indoor Football team based in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. The team began play in 2007 as an expansion {{team in the}} Continental Indoor Football League. <b>The</b> <b>Tide</b> were <b>the</b> first indoor football team to be based in Maryland. The Owner of <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> was Martin Johnson. <b>The</b> <b>Tide</b> played its home games at The Show Place Arena. Midway through the 2008 season the team was acquired by Messay Hailermariam. Hailermariam folded the team {{at the end of}} the season and founded the Maryland Maniacs. Despite playing in the same arena with the same head coach, the Maniacs are not a continuation of <b>the</b> <b>Tide.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the task of}} pointing ships into the channel, the lighthouse also signaled ships about the state of <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> During <b>the</b> day this was performed using two day signals installed on two corners of the structure, while during the night two 6th order dioptric lights showing different colors coded the state of <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> <b>The</b> different colours were changed manually, by lowering glass cylinders over the lanterns, which could be done from inside the structure. Records of <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> were also kept automatically by floats in tubes which graphed <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> level. <b>The</b> graphs were replaced every month and were sent to Greenwich where they were kept.|$|R
5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over <b>the</b> <b>tides,</b> but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten miles to the east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of <b>the</b> <b>tides,</b> pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} had to {{move the}} filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due to changes in <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> {{at that time of}} year. Similar to the previous episode, the spaceship was computer-generated. The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing popcorn and packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|E
25|$|There was a tidemill. When <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> was rising, water {{flowed into}} the mill pond driving a mill, when <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> was falling, water flowed {{back into the}} river, driving the mill.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tide</b> tables give <b>the</b> {{height of}} <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> above a chart datum making it {{feasible}} {{to calculate the}} depth of water at a given point and {{at a given time}} by adding the charted depth to the height of <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> One may calculate whether an area that dries is under water by subtracting the drying height from the given height calculated from <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> table.|$|R
50|$|Alabama outgained Auburn, 465 to 260, while <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> {{rushed for}} 286 yards and passed for 179. <b>The</b> <b>Tide</b> notched 24 first downs to Auburn's 12, limited the Tigers to 3-of-15 on third downs, {{and had the}} ball for 35 minutes, 23 seconds, {{compared}} to Auburn's 24:37. Safety Geno Matias-Smith led <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> with eight tackles and a forced fumble. Linebacker Reuben Foster had six stops, a pass breakup and a quarterback hurry, while Tide cornerback Marlon Humphrey had six tackles on the night. Linebacker Reggie Ragland had five stops while directing <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> defense on <b>the</b> field.|$|R
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, <b>the</b> <b>tides</b> had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|In his 1917 piece <b>The</b> <b>Tides</b> of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by <b>the</b> <b>tides,</b> and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E
