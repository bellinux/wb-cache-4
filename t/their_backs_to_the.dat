5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two waterways. If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|While Wellesley was {{preoccupied with}} re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his {{infantry}} and redeployed {{them into a}} semicircle with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley's infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry lingered in {{the distance to the}} west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to shield the {{participants}} from prosecution, procedures were implemented to give all witnesses plausible deniability. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath {{that they had not}} seen any pistols. They also stood with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> duelists.|$|E
25|$|In the south, the 38th Army {{attacked}} German {{troops of}} the LIX Corps defending with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highlands of Moravia. By means of a limited tactical withdrawal on 10 March, Heinrici was able to minimise the damage inflicted by the preparatory bombardment, and the front in this sector remained firm.|$|E
25|$|An attack {{beginning}} {{on the night}} of 26 January initially resulted in lead elements of the 28th Jäger Division breaking through to Elbing, where they linked up with the 7th Panzer Division; however German forces were driven back during the next four days after the 48th Army had regrouped.

25|$|The French, all but {{masters of}} Spain in June, stood with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pyrenees, {{clutching}} at Navarre and Catalonia. It {{was not known}} if even these two footholds could be maintained {{in the face of}} a Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with Spain's 35,000 British allies en route.|$|E
25|$|The last {{battle of}} the war was the Battle of Wireless Ridge by the 2nd Battalion. The ridge was taken with minimal {{casualties}} and an Argentinian counter-attack defeated. The Argentines now had <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, and only the capital, Stanley, remained to be liberated. Later that day, 14 June 1982, General Menéndez surrendered all Argentinian forces. The cost to the two battalions was 40 dead and 93 wounded.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Syriam, Alaungpaya waited out the monsoon season. In September, one Konbaung army marched from Syriam in the south, while another army marched from Toungoo (Taungoo) in the north. The advance was slow with great losses as the Hanthawaddy {{defenses}} still had cannon and they were literally fighting with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. By mid-October, the combined armies converged on Pegu. Konbaung war boats too flung off Hanthawaddy fire-rafts and completed the Konbaung line around the city.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing {{were killed}} when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead. The couple walked along the railway on a dark rainy night. When the train got to Horsted Keynes, the guard found a {{raincoat}} covered with blood on the engine. Another coat was found near two bodies {{in the middle of}} the tracks. The ganger who found them told the inquest the couple must have been walking with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> train.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Confederate Army, however, {{once they}} reached the Potomac they would find it {{difficult}} to cross. Torrential rains that started on July 4 flooded the river at Williamsport, making fording impossible. Four miles downstream at Falling Waters, Union cavalry dispatched from Harpers Ferry by Maj. Gen. William H. French destroyed Lee's lightly guarded pontoon bridge on July 4. The only way to cross the river was a small ferry at Williamsport. The Confederates could potentially be trapped, forced to defend themselves against Meade with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E

25|$|As Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had Maurice, then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, {{prepare a}} study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge “would be a very {{difficult}} enterprise so far as the nature of the country is concerned” and if successful “would not materially improve the military situation of the Allies in the western theatre” except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at “a grave disadvantage” and “in a rather dangerous position” with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea as the Germans counterattacked.|$|E
25|$|Incubation {{takes about}} 16 days in Crypturellus, which {{contains}} the smallest species, and 19–20 days in Tinamus and Eudromia. During this period the male is typically silent; {{if he does}} call, he does so away from the nest. As he incubates, he will leave the nest to feed, and he may be gone from 45 minutes to five hours, covering the eggs when he leaves. While incubating, he is mainly motionless and reluctant to move, even from potential danger. It is possible for a human observer to approach and touch the incubating male without eliciting an overt response. Some species will flatten themselves against the ground, stretch out their necks, and raise <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> air. This posture causes them to resemble a plant; however, if it is overdone, the eggs become visible from behind.|$|E

25|$|The {{army was}} {{well versed in}} the use of stratagems. A strong cavalry unit was often held in reserve and would attack the enemy at an opportune moment. Free horses would be {{sometimes}} concentrated behind the battle formation to avoid surprise attacks from the rear. The Bulgarian army used ambushes and feigned retreats, during which the cavalrymen rode with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse, firing clouds of arrows on the enemy. If the enemy pursued disorganized, they would turn back and fiercely attack them. The Bulgarians were able to fight at nightin 917 they defeated the Byzantine in the battle of Katasyrtai after a nocturnal combat. The army employed ruse de guerre. In 918 the Bulgarians took the capital of the Byzantine theme Hellas Thebes without bloodshed after sending into the city five men with axes who eliminated the guards, broke the hinges of the gates, and opened them to the main forces.|$|E
25|$|Each kohen's tallit is {{draped over}} his head and hands so that the {{congregation}} cannot see his hands while the blessing is said. Performing the Jewish ceremony of the priestly blessing is known in Yiddish as duchening, a reference to the bimah on which the blessing is said. The tradition of covering the hands stems from the biblical prohibition against a Kohen with hands that are disfigured in any way from offering the blessing. The rabbis softened this prohibition by saying that a Kohen with disfigured hands to which the community had become accustomed could bless. In later centuries, the practice became for all Kohanim to cover their hands so that any disfigurement would not be seen by the Congregation. This gave rise to folklore that one should not see the hands of the Kohen or even that harm would befall someone who sees the hands of the Kohen. Some congregants will even turn <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kohanim so as to avoid any possibility of seeing their hands—although this practice is unsupported by any rabbinic source.|$|E
25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, and it was so cold that the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E
