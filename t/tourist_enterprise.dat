Then, we examine the structural problems of the sector and analyze the relevant Institutional financing framework. In the second part we work out a critical assessment of the <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> existing financial framework, focussing on the financial difficulties that they face. In the last part of our paper, we set out our proposals concerning the adoption of the appropriate tourism policy that will contribute to the supporting of the aforementioned firms and especially to their access to finance (through Developmental Laws, E. U’s programs, financial Institutions like Credit Guarantee Fund for Small and Very Small Enterprises, etc). The most important conclusions that come out of the whole analysis of our paper, show that the majority of Greek Tourist Industry are small enterprises that they have the same structural characteristics (e. g: seasonal bussiness, mainly situated in insular regions, stayed behind large companies in terms of productivity, technological experience, financial and other areas. Particularly, they often lack creditworthiness and have trouble securing funds needed for their business activities). Furthermore, <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises,</b> like most small companies have only limited capital resources. So, they have to rely on banks and other financial institutions for their funds. Banks require sufficient collateral or a well-established surety for their debtors to secure a loan. The lack of such assets or appropriate surety makes it difficult for many small tourist business to obtain loans from financial houses. Thus, it is obvious that the pin pointing of the financial problems that the <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> face, facilitates the planing of the appropriate mix of tourism policy measures, that can lead to a more effective running of <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> and also contribute to the reinforcement of local entrepreneurship. ...|$|R

The six papers offer a comparative view of current social processes in two neighbouring Balkan countries, linked by numerous historical and political experiences. Comparative research into societal trends enables a more thorough understanding and monitoring of global processes. In today’s increasingly globalised and glocalised world, towns experience sudden changes {{and it is in}} the towns that these changes are most vividly to be seen. The focus of our research is on the dynamism of the contemporary town, on processuality and changes in societal practices. Ana Luleva examines life {{in the small town of}} Nessebar in southeast Bulgaria, which has been on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1983. The protection, management and presentation of Nessebar’s cultural heritage are highly complex issues, further complicated by the problem of collision with the interests of the inhabitants. The author analyses the relations between the various factors - the state administration, municipal authorities and the local population. Here the tourist industry, investment interests, corrupt institutions and civil society all play their part. Ivanka Petrova chose to research Belogradchik, a small town in northwest Bulgaria. Petrova investigates how local social and cultural resources are used in the work of a family <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The author looks for answers to questions such as: how its members identify with the town and its culture and how the work of the enterprise fits into the Belogradchik local context. At the focus of her paper are current societal practices: the local urban economy and the production of images and symbols. Milena Benovska Sabkova’s article analyses the identification processes of Bulgarian Muslims (Pomaks) in the small border town of Zlatograd in the far south of Bulgaria. The author points out the fluidity of ethnic and religious Muslim/ Christian boundaries and how Bulgarian Muslims overcome them. The Christian identity is perceived as being more prestigious in the existing ethnic and religious classification. The paper focuses on many current problems of cultural heritage, such as the opening of an open-air ethnographic complex, and identification in frontier zones. Ljiljana Gavrilović takes a broadly interpretative look at the problems of recognising and protecting the intangible cultural heritage of a town. The author gives a critical review of practice hitherto in implementing the Convention for Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (primarily based on the preservation of pre-modern elements), with a view to examining possibilities for a broader framework for the Convention as it applies to urban heritage. Sonja Petrović examines selected fragments from the autobiographic memories of Djordje Trifunović (born 1934), a professor at the Philological Faculty of Belgrade University. The paper draws a picture of how Belgrade grew from a small to a large city, depicting in vivid colour relations between the centre and the outskirts, place and space, freedom of movement and daily life. A view of the provincial border-town of Zaječar completes the contribution. Dejan Krstić examines current social and political processes in a small town in eastern Serbia, near the border with Bulgaria: a difficult economic situation, high unemployment, inadequate and corrupt local administration, depopulation and the specific features of identification in a peripheral area, but also the significant tourist potential the town possesses. In many aspects, Krstić’s work dovetails with articles by the Bulgarian authors. We hope that these papers will provide an opportunity for fresh, creative, dynamic reflection and writing on the town from aspects such as the urban heritage, identification processes in urban border areas, the importance of life histories, the exciting game of global vs. local, etc. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 177027 : Multietnicitet, multikulturalnost, migracije-savremeni procesi...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the work consists in the following. Tourism is appropriately {{considered one of the}} fastest growing sectors of the world economy of the XXI century. Under conditions of permanent economic crisis and therefore intense competition, the main task of the <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> is to conquer (hold) a leading place in its segment of the market of tourist services, gaining and increasing profits. One way to draw attention of consumers to their services is to offer to the market such a service which would be different from the existing ones. This should be contributed by the implementation of innovations. The issue of management of innovation activity of tourist businesses remains open and requires further consideration by scientists. The aim of our study was to define a framework of provisions for the management of innovation activity of <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> and to substantiate measures for its improvement. The set scientific tasks were performed with the help of comprehensive general scientific methods: analysis, synthesis and generalization. We examined the definitions of "innovation", "innovating activity", "innovation capacity" in relation to the specifics of the tourist business and <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> of Ukraine. The need for the involvement of managers of <b>tourist</b> <b>enterprises</b> to form the innovation potential of these enterprises was substantiated. We proposed to specify the concept of "innovation potential of tourist enterprise" as an opportunity to transform and streamline the experience and prevailing stereotypes of the interaction of the subjects of the business process and the concept of "innovation of the tourist company" as a set of scientific, organizational, technological, commercial, financial measures that promote innovation. It was stressed that to discuss the innovation potential of the company is possible only in the context of the tandem “innovation culture of an enterprise” and “professional culture of the manager”. We determined three components of the innovative activity of a tourist enterprise: activities focused on finding or creating new tourist products, new methods of servicing customers, pricing policy, etc.; activity aimed at the completion of the measures implemented earlier, to the level of innovative projects (services, products, technologies), oriented to the needs of the tourist market; measures for the implementation of innovative projects or technologies of production and service provision. The scientific novelty of the work is in the proposal to consider for the first time "the innovation potential of the tourist company" as an opportunity to transform and streamline the experience and prevailing stereotypes of the interaction of the subjects of the business process and “the innovating activity of the tourist company" as a set of scientific, organizational, technological, commercial, financial measures that lead to innovation. The practical value of the work lies in the possibility of using studied definitions of "innovation", "innovative activity", "innovation capacity", "innovation potential" in the practical work in the field of tourist business.
