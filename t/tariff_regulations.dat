2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic <b>tariff</b> <b>regulations</b> not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E

Moreover, the results indicate that an increase of solar generation leads to a higher increase in the industrial retail price than in the case of a proportional increase of wind generation. This suggests that, when evaluating the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> impact on the retail price, the cost of incentives effect prevails over the wholesale price effect, and this is stronger for solar than for wind generation...|$|R

The development of water sector in Malaysia in terms of coverage has been fairly uneven. Some states have privatized their water supply sector while others have not. The overall finding of this study is that the impact of privatization on access and affordability in the Malaysian water supply sector is ambiguous. Privatization does not seem to have improved access to treated water from network in Malaysia. A likely explanation of this is the role played by the government in the sector in terms of <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> and universal service provision. Furthermore, privatization does not seem to have adversely affected affordability in the sector.

40|$|Abstract — Under the {{enhanced}} single buyer model of electricity supply industry in Thailand, tariff regulation {{is needed to}} prevent unfair pricing for consumers. Retail electricity tariff, being separated into base tariff and automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, has been regulated by multiple regulatory bodies. Findings reveal that Thai electricity base <b>tariff</b> <b>regulations</b> tended to favor electric utilities rather than consumers, basing on rate of return regulatory approach. In addition, the automatic tariff adjustment mechanism attached greater importance to operators than to the consumers, enabling the former to fully pass the fuel and power purchase burdens through to the consumers. The results of adoption of current regulatory regime are excess capacity in electricity supply industry and excessive profits for electric utilities. This paper, thus, proposed tariff regulatory alternatives that could enhance efficiency of operators while simultaneously sharing these benefits with consumers...|$|E

Electrical distribution systems have compared to other technical systems several special characteristics which are important to take into consideration when introducing reliability analysis methods. Moreover, the paper gives a brief discussion on the effects and the importance of customer participation in improving system reliability by providing additional system operating reserve from the market perspective. Finally, the paper discusses the reliability analysis with the reliability test systems, and stresses the usefulness of generally known test systems for such assessments.

40|$|The Energy Market Inspectorate is {{implementing}} a new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> in Sweden. A {{small part of}} the new regulation concerns effectible operation costs and originally they where intended to be calculated using a modification of equivalent comparison standards, in Swedish Ekm. This thesis is intended to analyze if Fortums grid in Stockholm could be described correctly, using equivalent comparison standards. In Ekm every part of the distribution grid is designated a weighting in relation to 1 km 0. 4 kV over head line. These Ekm-measurements are intended to simplify comparison between different grid areas with different structure and geographical conditions. The goal of this report is to asses Ekmmeasurements suitability for calculating DSOs effectible operation costs. During the work on this report, the Energy Market Inspectorate decide not to use Ekm during the first four year regulatory period. The focus therefor changed to increase Fortums knowledge about Ekm-measurements for preparation purposes. This report includes a short introduction to the problem at hand, as well as underlying theory about power distribution and the new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation.</b> A description of gathered data, calculations and analysis of data follows. The result is presented as a selection of Fortum specific Ekm-measurements for both operation and maintenance cost as well as customer related costs. Existing Ekm-measurements where found to be unreliable. In the later part of the report the results are discussed and the conclusion is drawn. Existing Ekm-measurements are not suitable to describe the grid in Stockholm. However it {{can not be ruled out}} that a modified version of the measurements could render better values in the new <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation.</b> Because of this conclusion further studies are desired. ...|$|R

The latest blow against risk classification in car insurance comes with the EU Employment and Social Affairs’ draft directive on gender equality which proposes to prohibit gender specific calculation of all private insurance products, including non-mandatory branches such as life, private health or comprehensive car insurance. ...|$|E

This is done by general analyses {{as well as by}} authentic calculation examples of a real power distribution system. The paper describes the Swedish <b>tariff</b> <b>regulation</b> with expected changes, provides a summary of changes in Swedish laws and regulation affecting DSOs between 1996 and 2016, describes how a DSO at local distribution level conduct their reinvestments, illustrates economic calculation examples and finally presents analyses and conclude the results. Analysis results presented show that the outcome from the regulation is sensitive towards relatively small changes in WACC and age structure. The tariff cap allowed will however be significantly reduced for all tested scenarios. A reinvestment rate of in average~ 10 % regarding meters and IT and ~ 2. 5 % regarding all other categories could be a rough guideline to meet the new incentives, but that could differ depending on the actual age structure of the DSO.
