2500|$|The Pittsburgh City-County Building (serving as City Hall) is {{separate}} from the courthouse, and is jointly owned by the city and county.

[...] Since 1982, the city had also placed a menorah with the Christmas tree in front of the City-County Building. The city did not own the menorah, but placed, removed, and stored it each year. The menorah was owned by Chabad House, Pittsburgh's Lubavitch Center.|$|E

The changing of the seasons, planting and harvest times and religious ceremonies have all shared their rituals with nature's flowers, branches and entire plants, trees and shrubs.

40|$|Although fall-related {{injuries}} occur {{throughout the}} year (1), few studies have analyzed seasonal patterns (2 – 4), and none have examined the extent of such injuries associated with holiday decorating. To characterize nonfatal fall injuries associated with decorating or related activities, CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for three winter <b>holiday</b> <b>seasons.</b> <b>This</b> report summarizes {{the results of that}} analysis, which indicated that, during 2000 – 2003, an estimated 17, 465 persons were treated in U. S. hospital emergency departments (EDs) for holiday-decorating–related falls. Approximately 62 % of those injured were aged 20 – 49 years; approximately 43 % of injuries were caused by falls from ladders; and males were 40 % more likely than females to be injured. Prevention strategies should focus on raising awareness about falls and promoting safety practices during the <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> For <b>this</b> analysis, the <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> was defined as November 1 –January 31, when decorating or related activities (e. g., stringing and removing outdoor lights) usually occur. A fallrelated injury was defined as one received when a person descended because of the force of gravity and struck a surface at the same or lower level. A case was defined as an unintentional fall-related injury that occurred to a person during the <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> and included a product description (e. g., holiday lights) or a brief narrative in the NEISS-AIP database that listed decorating or a related activity as contributing to the injury.

60|$|After the dinner-table {{was removed}} {{the hall was}} given up to the younger members of the family, who, {{prompted}} to all kind of noisy mirth by the Oxonian and Master Simon, made its old walls ring with their merriment as they played at romping games. I delight in witnessing the gambols of children, and particularly at <b>this</b> happy <b>holiday</b> <b>season,</b> and could not help stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of laughter. I found them at the game of blindman's-buff. Master Simon, who {{was the leader of}} their revels, and seemed on all occasions to fulfill the office of that ancient potentate, the Lord of Misrule,* was blinded {{in the midst of the}} hall. The little beings were as busy about him as the mock fairies about Falstaff, pinching him, plucking at the skirts of his coat, and tickling him with straws. One fine blue-eyed girl of about thirteen, with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion, her frolic face in a glow, her frock half torn off her shoulders, a complete picture of a romp, was the chief tormentor; and, from the slyness with which Master Simon avoided the smaller game and hemmed this wild little nymph in corners, and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs, I suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was convenient.|$|R
5000|$|A slight format change {{occurred}} as KRTH added adult contemporary Christmas music during the <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> from performers such as Mannheim Steamroller, Air Supply, and Barry Manilow.
