5|$|Oxbow's second-place {{finish in}} <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes in June {{made him the}} third horse that year to reach $1million in purse wins. Following <b>the</b> <b>Belmont,</b> he was ranked the top three-year-old racehorse in the United States by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA). He was pulled up shortly after {{finishing}} fourth in the Haskell Invitational, and {{was found to have}} suffered a soft tissue injury, was taken out of competition for the remainder of his three-year-old season, and retired in October 2013. He stands at stud for the 2015 breeding season at Calumet Farms.|$|E
5|$|The second-place {{finish in}} <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> earned Oxbow $200,000 and pushed {{him over the}} $1million mark in career earnings, making him the third horse in 2013 to reach $1million in purse wins, behind Orb and a fellow Awesome Again son, the six-year-old gelding Game On Dude. Although the $1million bonus for the horse winning the highest {{combined}} Triple Crown points has long been discontinued, Oxbow would have won it over Orb owing to his win in the Preakness and second in <b>the</b> <b>Belmont.</b> Further, his placing in <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> put him at {{number one in the}} post-Belmont June 10 NTRA poll of top three-year-olds, and in the top ten for race horses of all ages.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before <b>the</b> <b>Belmont,</b> Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

50|$|Fred Milano (August 26, 1939 - January 1, 2012) was an American doo-wop singer.

Through his combined victories at <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were stakes records and still stand to this day.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E

Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After <b>the</b> <b>Belmont,</b> Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 stud fee, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won <b>the</b> <b>Belmont</b> Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E
