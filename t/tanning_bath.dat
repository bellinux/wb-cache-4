The feeding solutions in the bed volumes of 200 and 190 were used for each installation system. The regeneration behaviour of the resin was determined by using reverse regeneration procedure with the solution of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline. The regeneration kinetics of the exhausted resin was examined with a range of the solutions having different concentration series of the alkaline hydrogen peroxide. The solutions of the basic chromium sulphate were recycled for each installation system following the regeneration cycles.

The results of this preliminary investigation demonstrate that, while no nuclear DNA can be PCR-amplified from any of the specimens, mitochondrial DNA can be amplified from all samples. To investigate this contrasting pattern of DNA survival further, we have vegetable-tanned cow skin in our own laboratory, and directly assayed the survival of PCR-amplifiable mitochondrial and nuclear DNA at each step of the process. The results indicate that nuclear DNA is reduced to sub-amplifiable levels {{as a result of the}} <b>tanning</b> <b>baths,</b> whereas amplifiable mitochondrial DNA survives the complete process.

40|$|Waste {{from the}} {{manufacture}} of chrome-tanned leathers (so-called shavings) can be processed (apart from alkaline or acid breakdown) by enzymatic hydrolysis employing alkaline proteases.

Further use of the chrome cake, e. g., <b>tanning</b> <b>bath</b> recycling, necessitates a maximum possible reduction in the protein fraction. This work performed deproteination of the chrome cake by decantation washing with water and enzymatic hydrolysis. Decantation washing of the chrome cake obtained after twostage enzymatic hydrolysis of chrome-tanned shavings was performed six times with drinking water at laboratory temperature. A reduction in protein content occurs, as was proved by chemical analysis of chrome cakes prior to and after washing. Further deproteination of the chrome cake so washed (hence disposed of soluble part) was executed by means of additional enzymatic hydrolysis with ESPERASE and TRYPSIN. It was proved that further deproteination of chrome cake proceeded from this treatment even under very low concentrations of enzymes...|$|E

40|$|The leather {{industries}} produce daily {{large amounts}} of effluents highly contaminated by chromium salts. The use of sorption phenomenon, especially biosorption on dead residues of microorganisms produced by fermentation industries, can be an economical alternative method to depollute these effluents from heavy toxic metals. In this study we have investigated the adsorption capacity of Cr(III) present in the samples of effluents from a Algeria tannery, by the mycelial by-products of filamentous fungi as Rhizopus arrhizus. Efficiency of metal ion recovery from metalloaded biomass and subsequent regeneration of the biosorbent were also determined. The results show that, at pH 4. 8, the biomass was able to adsorb 60 mg/g biomass while precipitation effects augmented these values at higher pH ranges. Adjusting the pH value to about 0 resulted in 95 % and 90 % recovery of Cr by used H 2 SO 4 and HCl respectively. The biomass resulted from desorption processes was able to retain approximately 95 % of original adsorption capacity for Cr with sixteenth repeated adsorption and recovery runs. The rate of elimination of the chromium in the effluent of the tannery is about 83 % after the sixteenth cycle. The chromium recovered is reused in tannery for preparation of new <b>tanning</b> <b>bath</b> and the obtained results {{are similar to those}} obtained by the use of the conventional chromium...|$|E

40|$|Tannery {{wastewater}} {{requires an}} adequate treatment for chromium removal before discharge, to prevent environmental pollution. Chromium sulphate, in fact, {{is the most}} used compound to stabilise animal hides, and therefore high concentrations of Cr(III) are found in spent <b>tanning</b> <b>baths.</b> To front the problem precipitation processes, based on lime addition, are frequently adopted, because of their low cost. Nonetheless, due to the colloidal form of precipitates, these processes have {{to be carried out}} with great attention to reach required performances. An interesting alternative to precipitation processes is represented by adsorption of chromium on low cost-materials, especially if chromium can be recovered from produced sludges, regenerating the adsorbent, and reducing sludge toxicity. Among others, chitosan, a carbohydrate obtained from deacetilation of chitin, the second polysaccharide for diffusion in the environment, seems to be very attractive. Previous studies, in fact, have shown that it has a good sequestrating ability towards many heavy metals, including chromium, and can be added during treatment as component of seafood shells, instead of being dosed as pure chemical product. Starting from these considerations it is presented an experimental study, whose aim is to better understand the advantages of chitosan use for tannery wastewater treatment. The study includes a preliminary investigation on the main mechanisms responsible for chromium removal in presence of chitosan, discerning between adsorption on polymeric groups of this polysaccharide, and formation of insoluble chromium hydroxide, caused by pH increase induced by chitosan addition. Process efficiency is also quantified, and treatment optimisation is proposed. This part of the study, carried out with synthetic wastewater to exclude any effects related to compounds other than chromium, allows to recognize adsorption as the main process causing chromium removal, and to assess the good performances related to chitosan as sequestrating agent. Successive investigations, carried out using real wastewater, concern, instead, the possibility of chromium recovery from produced sludge, and the possibility of process development using seafood shells instead of commercial chitosan. Obtained results, illustrated and discussed in the paper, show that chromium recovery from sludge is possible at very low pH values, and that shrimp shells use increases chromium removal efficiency, due to the development of precipitation processes together with adsorption ones...|$|R
40|$|Internationally about 400000 tons of Chrome {{tanning agents}} are used annually. The {{efficiency}} of {{the present state of}} the art tanning technology would suggest that about 60000 tons of chrome tanning agents remain unutilised during the chrome tanning and might be discharged into the environment. Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable chrome tanning agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of chrome tanning by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during chrome tanning, changing the present technology and by modifying the chrome tanning agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of chrome tanning were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of chrome tanning and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of chrome tanning, was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by crystallisation technique. Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor. The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic chrome sulphate. Tanning trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional chrome tanning showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for lamb skin but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed chrome tanning process, a significant improvement in chrome tanning was obtained. The exhaustion of chrome was more than 99 % and leather stood boil within two hours, shortening the chrome tanning process considerably. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines The novel process without pickling was tried successfully in the industry. The principle of this no-pickle novel chrome tanning system was extended to the pretanned lamb skins where chrome tanning was successfully carried out at high pH after degreasing without readjusting the pH of the <b>tanning</b> <b>bath</b> with acid to 3. 0 - 3. 5 and tanning completed without basification...|$|E
