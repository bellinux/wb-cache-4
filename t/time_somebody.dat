25|$|In 1399 Jadwiga of Poland and {{her newborn}} died in childbirth. Jogaila's power in Poland was jeopardised {{as he was}} a {{foreigner}} king with no other ties to the throne but his wife. Also, the defeat at Vorskla forced a re-evaluation {{of the relationship between}} Poland and Lithuania. The result was the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. Vytautas was granted wide autonomy, but after his death the title and powers of Grand Duke of Lithuania were to be transferred to the king of Poland or vice versa. In case Jagiełło died first without an heir, the Polish nobility agreed not to elect a new king without consulting Vytautas. The unique feature of this union was that the Lithuanian nobility presented their own document: for the first <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> other than dukes {{played a role in the}} state matters.|$|E
500|$|On February 7, 2013, {{only one}} witness {{took the stand}} before the hearing was adjourned. Lukáš Havlena {{contacted}} the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he [...] "didn't like {{the description of the}} situation" [...] by the previous witnesses. He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night, and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show. He also said that each <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> got on the stage, Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there. Havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive, somebody aided his fall from behind. He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground. Havlena had trouble recalling details from the show, as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in Abaton, and thus could not describe, among other things, the position of the guardrail.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked why}} the company decided to work with AMC, Grant’s President, Grant McCoon responded, “Rambler is a good automobile, and it's <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> proved what it can do.” The {{relationship}} provided both companies with national exposure and publicity.

2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E
2500|$|For his own part, Zhirinovsky {{has done}} a great deal to foster a {{reputation}} as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear. Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available. Zhirinovsky has on several occasions become involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, he also took part in the 2000 and 2008 presidential elections, promising a [...] "police state", and to institute summary executions. A BBC documentary from 1995 showed Zhirinovsky telling the crowd at a campaign rally: [...] "Help us, and you'll never have to vote again! I'm not saying, [...] "Vote for us and maybe in 20 years' <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> will do something". No, these will be the last elections! The last ones!". Some commentators call Zhirinovsky a fascist or a neo-fascist.|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{views were}} {{formulated}} as a 24-year-old officer in Normandy... On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine... Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which <b>time</b> <b>somebody</b> else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his convincing {{victory over}} Keating, Hawke was seen after the result as a [...] "wounded" [...] leader; he had now lost his {{long-term}} political partner, his rating in opinion polls began to decrease, and after nearly nine years as prime minister, many were openly speculating {{that he was}} [...] "tired", {{and that it was}} <b>time</b> for <b>somebody</b> new.|$|R
