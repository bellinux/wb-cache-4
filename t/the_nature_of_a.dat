However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to the manner in which he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E

Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
40|$|Object-oriented {{programming}} {{is seen as}} a difficult skill to master. There is considerable debate about the most appropriate way to introduce novice programmers to object-oriented concepts. Is it possible to uncover what the critical aspects or features are that enhance the learning of object-oriented programming? Practitioners have differing understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object-oriented program. Uncovering these different ways of understanding leads to agreater understanding of the critical aspects and their relationship tothe structure of the program produced. A phenomenographic studywas conducted to uncover practitioner understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object-oriented program. <b>The</b> study identified five levels of understanding and three dimensions of variation within these levels. These levels and dimensions <b>of</b> variation provide <b>a</b> framework for fostering conceptual change with respect to <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object-oriented program...|$|R

5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
