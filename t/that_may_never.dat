25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over something <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to do something to help RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and how they want things to go.|$|E
25|$|Neoteny is {{commonly}} seen in flightless insects like the {{females in the}} order Strepsiptera. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that {{may have contributed to}} the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates. These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity, this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes. In those instances, neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity. Aphids are a great example of insects <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.|$|E

2500|$|Some of his restorations, {{such as that}} of the Château de Pierrefonds, {{have become}} very {{controversial}} because they were not intended so much to recreate a historical situation accurately as to create a [...] "perfect building" [...] of medieval style: [...] "to restore an edifice", he observed in the Dictionnaire raisonné, [...] "is not to maintain it, repair or rebuild it, but to re-establish it in a complete state <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> have existed at a particular moment". The idea and the very word restoration applied to architecture Viollet-le-Duc considered part of a modern innovation.

2500|$|The mood of Arnold's poetry {{tends to}} be of plaintive reflection, and he is {{restrained}} in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the 'criticism of life' and express a philosophy. Arnold's philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues {{that we should not}} live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be attained. This philosophy is clearly expressed in such poems as [...] "Dover Beach" [...] and in these lines from [...] "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse": ...|$|E

2500|$|By far {{the most}} criticized have been episodes four and five for their shift away from the {{realistic}} style of Rebirth and the first few episodes, to the [...] "traditional mythology well known to longtime Kombat fans". Tancharoen also acknowledged the audience split that the [...] "Kitana & Mileena" [...] episodes created, stating that theirs was a story {{that could not be}} told in a realistic environment, and that Warner Bros. [...] "wanted to make sure this web series tied into some of the story lines of the Mortal Kombat canon." [...] Unlike episode four, IGN criticized the use of animation this time, stating it cost the episode its energy and created a glut of continuity errors. Cheaper make-up, costume effects, and set design due to budgetary constraints, and a short running time were among the other criticisms. Upon the release of the Raiden-themed episode six, Houston Press suggested that Tancharoen was forced to steer episodes four and five into the traditional Mortal Kombat mystique by Warner Bros. to test how fans would react. Episode six, according to the reviewer, was the studio allowing Tancharoen to return to his own style, finally delivering [...] "cinematic greatness" [...] and [...] "the best [...] he's done so far. Possibly even better than the original Mortal Kombat: Rebirth". Film School Rejects bemoaned the series' expectation that its viewers be knowledgeable about the franchise's history, explaining that without previous knowledge of the games, the viewer is left with too many questions <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be answered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} game {{cover was}} revealed by Irrational Games in early December 2012; the art featured DeWitt against a burning flag {{with some other}} elements of the game. Several journalists were critical of the art, with the lack of any major elements from the game including Elizabeth, and lacking any of the uniqueness that BioShock Infinite had set itself to be prior to this point, such as through the Game Informer Saturday Evening Post-inspired covers. Erik Kain of Forbes considered the art [...] "generic", while Owen Good of Kotaku considered it both [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cliché"; Gieson Cacho of the San Jose Mercury News noted that the cover was reminiscent of , down to the pose of DeWitt matching that of Nathan Drake. Levine responded to these complaints commenting that they had decided to make the cover art something to draw the attention of the more casual player, [...] "the uninformed, the person who doesn't read IGN" [...] <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> have heard of the game, knowing that those players that are already planning to purchase the game {{do not need to be}} swayed further. A public poll was opened by Irrational to allow players to decide what the reversible cover art should be, while alternate cover art will be provided as downloadable files that players can print and use. Levine further showed the back cover art, which includes Elizabeth, an element further designed to draw interest in casual players. Levine stated that for the cover and other parts of the game's promotion including live-action commercials, they had hired Anna [...] "Ormeli" [...] Moleva, a Russian cosplayer that had earlier attracted attention for her recreation of Elizabeth back in September 2011.|$|E
