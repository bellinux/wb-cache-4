5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. <b>To</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding {{of the history of the}} planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E

Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers.

Attempting <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> view only minutes before Wool attacked.

An analysis of German data reveals conceptual and methodological differences, {{and their impact on}} economic indicators, namely imported inflation, terms of trade and gross domestic product, is quantified. By introducing a formal theory, the sources of the discrepancy can be attributed to a Laspeyres effect and a structural component, both strongly negative.

40|$|AbstractThis paper takes {{issue with}} the {{traditional}} notion that collocation is a binary combination.

Therefore, the LCM proposes to complement the node-collocate distinction by incorporating the notion of co-collocate. In this study we examine evidence suggesting that the distinction between collocates and co-collocates can contribute <b>to</b> <b>gaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the relations between meaning and context.

25|$|In 1995, CERN {{announced}} that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the SLAC/Fermilab concept during the PS210 experiment. The experiment was performed using the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, ATHENA and ATRAP.|$|E

Analogues of GHB such as 3-methyl-GHB, 4-methyl-GHB, and 4-phenyl-GHB {{have been shown}} to produce similar effects to GHB in some animal studies, but these compounds are even less well researched than GHB itself. Of these analogues, only 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and a prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting.|$|E

The Independent's Arifa Akbar stated, [...] "The changing points of view and leaps in time can confuse and confine, leaving characters clearly defined but lacking depth. Decades gallop by and {{it is as if the}} story of these interconnected, cross -generational lives will simply go on echoing the original crime of Abdullah and Pari's separation." [...] Michiko Kakutani from The New York Times thought the novella-like storytelling was handled well and wrote, [...] "Khaled Hosseini's new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, may have the most awkward title in his body of work, but it's his most assured and emotionally gripping story yet, more fluent and ambitious than The Kite Runner (2003), more narratively complex than A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)."

The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy.
