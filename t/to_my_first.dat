25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record. [...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, {{is really going to be}} bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If I had to work at McDonald's for the rest of my life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{beginning}} of my efforts {{to make my own}} statement, I would trace <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> visit to the Phillips Gallery.... Landscape was a natural metaphor, and so it is still for me today, in my three-dimensional double canvases".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{box office}} success for The Lady Eve and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, {{conflict}} with Paramount's studio bosses increased. In particular, executive producer Buddy DeSylva never really trusted his star writer-director and was wary (and arguably jealous) of the independence Sturges enjoyed on his projects. One {{of the sources of}} conflict was that Sturges liked to reuse many of the same character actors in his films, thus creating what amounted to a regular troupe he could call upon within the studio system. [...] Paramount feared that the audience would tire of repeatedly seeing the same faces in Sturges productions. But the director was adamant, stating, [...] "hese little players who had contributed so much <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures." [...] The way Sturges wrote and directed these actors created a succession of what film critic Andrew Sarris later called [...] "self-expressive cameos of aggressive individualism."> ...|$|E
60|$|I {{mention this}} part, because I am {{no more to}} forget the {{obligation}} upon me to the queen, than <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> benefactor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{answered}} as <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> offer. I'll {{take the}} lumber, agreein' {{not to cut}} another tree, and the valie of the betterments can be left out to men." ...|$|E

60|$|I recall myself now <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{intention}} of being simply, but not silently, grateful to you; and entreating you to pardon this letter too quickly {{to think it}} necessary-to answer it....|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] he murmured, warningly--and I {{realised}} {{suddenly that}} all my future, the only future for which I was fit, would perhaps go irretrievably to pieces in any mishap <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> command.|$|E
60|$|Palm. Life, like a prodigal, {{gave all}} his store <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> youth, and now can give no more. You are a prince; and, in that high degree, No longer must {{converse}} with humble me.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> answer <b>to</b> the beggars was a {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> attendant, {{backed by the}} simple action of turning my pockets inside out; and, whilst he was battling with the beggars, I proceeded <b>to</b> cast <b>my</b> <b>first</b> coup-d'oeil upon the Rauzah.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's some distance, and we don't {{do things}} so quickly here. I must talk <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother <b>first.</b> Besides, the agent {{may not have}} got up." ...|$|R

60|$|From this digression, which I {{hope will}} not be disagreeable, as it is not very tedious, I come back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> observation, that England is a trading country, and two things I offer from that head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] quoth she, {{smiling as}} of old, [...] "we must seal this missive. Cut off one lock {{of my hair}} with your dagger, for my last gift <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> friend, and make the seal all orderly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to say that I differ from you; I lean <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> notion still--that Mr.--Mr. Manston is most {{desirable}} in tone and bearing, and even specifically; I think he would suit me best in the long-run.' ...|$|E

6000|$|My aunt, {{on being}} {{requested}} to sign, complied under protest. [...] "A bad beginning!" [...] she said, pointing <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> unfortunate signature with the feather {{end of her}} pen. [...] "I hope, my dear, you may not live to regret it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no good asking me," [...] said Kennedy. [...] "I suppose it's a put-up {{job to make}} me look a fool. I {{ought to}} have known {{something}} of this kind would happen when I saw what they did <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> notice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear," [...] Gavin {{answered}} resolutely, [...] "and now is {{the time}} for me <b>to</b> have <b>my</b> <b>first</b> and last talk with him. Remain here, Babbie. Do not move till I come back." ...|$|R

60|$|As I threw <b>my</b> rifle <b>to</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, I thanked God, {{the ancient}} God of my ancestors, that I had {{replaced}} the hard-jacketed bullets in my weapon with soft-nosed projectiles, for though this was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experience with Felis leo, I knew the moment that I faced that charge that even my wonderfully perfected firearm would be as futile as a peashooter unless I chanced <b>to</b> place <b>my</b> <b>first</b> bullet in a vital spot.|$|R
