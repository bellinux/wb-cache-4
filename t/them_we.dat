Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take anything away from <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{application}} of the extendability of a uniform continuous function is the proof of the inverse Fourier transformation formula. We first prove that the formula is true for test functions, there are densely many of <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> then extend the inverse map to the whole space using the fact that linear map is continuous; thus, uniformly continuous.|$|E

25|$|We {{had already}} long since learned that under {{conditions}} as they existed in China at that time, official permits alone were apt {{to have a}} negative rather than positive value. They by no means assured us of liberty to proceed with an enterprise unmolested; but without <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were certain to be hindered, blackmailed, or even stopped altogether. (Feb. 1925).|$|E
25|$|Whistles come in {{all shapes}} and sizes, but their {{operation}} can be unified through the concepts of dynamic and geometric similarity. Nature knows nothing of the specific measurement systems we use; it cares only about ratios between the various forces, time scales, and the several dimensions. To compare <b>them</b> <b>we</b> need {{to take into account the}} established ratios that are relevant to whistle operation.|$|E
25|$|Most of <b>them</b> <b>we</b> {{know only}} by their coins, {{a great many of}} which are found in Afghanistan. By these wars, the {{dominant}} position of the Greeks was undermined even more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. After Demetrius and Eucratides, the kings abandoned the Attic standard of coinage and introduced a native standard, no doubt to gain support from outside the Greek minority.|$|E

25|$|Anywhere that œ ~ oe ~ e is {{followed}} by another vowel (no matter the position(s) of stress(es) in the word, entailing that this category overlaps with certain stress-dependent ones below, in which circumstances it then overrides all of <b>them),</b> <b>we</b> pronounce it as “long E”, as in: onomatopœic, onomatopœia, dyspnœa, apnœa, amenorrhœa, diarrhœa, logorrhœa, Eubœa; Bœotia(n), homœosis and its plural, homœoses, homœopathy; homœopath; homœopathic, homœostatic, homœostasis, homœozoic, homœomorphic, and homœomorphism.|$|E
25|$|Those {{representatives of}} the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch of}} counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once {{conditions}} are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of <b>them</b> <b>we</b> have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more we {{have been exposed to}} <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> have now become so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E

25|$|Though {{hopeful that}} {{humanity}} will ultimately prosper {{by the use}} of automatons, he mentions a few ways this relationship with technology could be detrimental. Automatons must not be taken for granted, because with advances in technology that allow them to learn, the machines may be able to escape human control if humans do not continue proper supervision of <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> might become entirely dependent on them, or even controlled by them. There is danger in trusting decisions to something which cannot think abstractly, and may therefore be unlikely to identify with intellectual human values which are not purely utilitarian.|$|E
25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did {{we get rid of}} <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> walked up the middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without <b>them</b> <b>we</b> could never come to know God.|$|E

60|$|With these {{arguments}} I prevailed on <b>them,</b> and <b>we</b> all resolved to steer away S.E. for the Cape of Good Hope; and, in {{consequence of this}} resolution, we concluded to keep the sloop, and sail with all three, not doubting, as I assured <b>them,</b> but <b>we</b> should find men there {{to make up the}} number wanting, and if not, we might cast any of <b>them</b> off when <b>we</b> pleased.|$|R
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for <b>them).</b> <b>We</b> shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust <b>them,</b> <b>we</b> know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear <b>them.</b> <b>We</b> exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E

25|$|Overlapping sub-problems {{means that}} the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any {{recursive}} algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: F'i = F'i1 + F'i2, with base case F1=F2=1. Then F43 =F42+F41, and F42 =F41+F40. Now F41 is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F43 as well as F42. Even though {{the total number of}} sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of <b>them),</b> <b>we</b> end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, in {{the utopian}} worlds of the Greeks, there was often {{no place for}} prostitutes. In Aristophanes' play Assemblywomen, the heroine Praxagora {{formally}} bans them from the ideal city: Why, undoubtedly! Furthermore, I propose abolishing the whores … so that, instead of <b>them,</b> <b>we</b> may have the first-fruits of the young men. It is not meet that tricked-out slaves should rob free-born women of their pleasures. Let the courtesans be free to sleep with the slaves.(v.716–719). The prostitutes are obviously considered to be unfair competition. In a different genre, Plato, in the Republic, proscribed Corinthian prostitutes {{in the same way}} as Attican pastries, both being accused of introducing luxury and discord into the ideal city. The cynic Crates of Thebes, (cited by Diodorus Siculus, II, 55–60) during the Hellenistic period describes a utopian city where, following the example of Plato, prostitution is also banished.|$|E
