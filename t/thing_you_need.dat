500|$|Horsfield's first Premier League goal {{came in the}} September 2002 local derby {{defeat of}} Aston Villa. He also scored in the return fixture at Villa Park, an eventful game in which he ended up keeping goal when Nico Vaesen was injured after Birmingham had used all their substitutes. Horsfield missed games through {{suspension}} and surgery, and was frustrated by manager Steve Bruce preferring to use him as a specialist substitute; after he came on to score a late winner against local rivals West Bromwich Albion, Bruce described him as [...] "a manager's dream", saying that [...] "when you're tiring, the last <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> is Big Horse rampaging at you". Starting alongside World Cup-winner Christophe Dugarry late in the season, the pair formed [...] "an unlikely combination, brilliance from Bordeaux alongside a brickie from Barnsley, but Horsfield's robust approach has complemented Dugarry's more delicate touches"; their partnership produced four wins and a draw from the last six games.|$|E

In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> right now is a knife." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Blasko co-composed the score, with Stefan Gregory (sound designer), for Bell Shakespeare's {{production}} of Hamlet, which ran from June to August. Diana Simmonds of Stage Noise was disappointed by {{an aspect of}} the opening night [...] "ess successful on opening night at least were the songs which open and then punctuate the action, composed and performed by [...] Her face mike and/or the sound balance muddied the lyrics and the one <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> in Shakespeare is to hear the words". Whereas Helen Barry of Australian Stage felt Blasko was [...] "truly sublime ... er musical accompaniments add a layer of melancholy rapture to the performance which {{goes to the heart of}} Hamlet's grief, anger and loss. Ingeniously, Blasko is incorporated into the production itself as one of the players, which creates a seamless quality to her musical interludes".|$|E

[...] A Daily Post reporter quipped [...] "No wedding goes without a hitch in soapland, and Toadie and Sonya's is no exception." [...] On the day the episode was broadcast in the UK, All About Soaps Claire Crick wrote [...] "There's just one <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to have {{at the top of your}} to-do list today… and that's watch Neighbours!

6000|$|I don't know, to {{be quite}} candid about it, who {{mentioned}} whisky first. In these days everybody {{has to be a}} little careful. I imagine we had all been thinking whisky for some time before anybody said it. But there is a sort of convention that when men go fishing they must have whisky. Each man makes the pretence that one thing he needs at six o'clock in the morning is cold raw whisky. It is spoken of in terms of affection. One man says the first <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> if you're going fishing is a good [...] "snort" [...] of whisky; another says that a good [...] "snifter" [...] is the very thing; and the others agree that no man can fish properly without [...] "a horn," [...] or a [...] "bracer" [...] or an [...] "eye-opener."

A few close {{studies will}} soon teach you this: the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> {{to be told}} is to watch {{carefully}} the lines of disturbance on the surface, as when a bird swims across it, or a fish rises, or the current plays round a stone, reed, or other obstacle. Take the greatest pains to get the curves of these lines true; the whole value of your careful drawing of the reflections may be lost by your admitting a single false curve of ripple from a wild duck's breast. And (as in other subjects) if you are dissatisfied with your result, always try for more unity and delicacy: if your reflections are only soft and gradated enough, they are nearly sure {{to give you a}} pleasant effect.[35] When you are taking pains, work the softer reflections, where they are drawn out by motion in the water, with touches as nearly horizontal as may be; but when you are in a hurry, indicate the place and play of the images with vertical lines. The actual construction of a calm elongated reflection is with horizontal lines: but it is often impossible to draw the descending shades delicately enough with a horizontal touch; and it is best always when you are in a hurry, and sometimes when you are not, to use the vertical touch. When the ripples are large, the reflections become shaken, and must be drawn with bold undulatory descending lines.|$|E
