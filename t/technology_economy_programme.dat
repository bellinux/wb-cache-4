40|$|Intra-Asian {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) is dominated by flows from high <b>technology</b> <b>economies</b> to medium <b>technology</b> <b>economies,</b> while FDI elsewhere primarily consists of flows among high <b>technology</b> <b>economies.</b> This distinctive pattern is not due simply to differences in the relative distribution of Asian FDI recipients by technology, or to systematic differences in Asia’s technology characteristics. A gravity model analysis is used to explore whether Asian FDI patterns differ significantly from those elsewhere, and if so, in what ways. The results show that Asian FDI flows, in contrast to other FDI flows, systematically favor hosts with relatively low technology achievement and relatively strong intellectual property rights regimes. This type of “Asian exceptionalism ” is consistent with “flying geese ” theories that have argued that Asian development {{is the result of}} <b>technology</b> flows among <b>economies</b> that occupy nearby rungs of the technology ladder...|$|R
