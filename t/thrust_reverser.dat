5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft, the RB.199 is {{fitted with}} thrust reversers to {{decrease}} the distance required to safely land. To fully deploy the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> during landings, the yaw damper {{is connected to the}} steering of the nosewheel to provide greater stability.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA903, {{surplus to}} Blue Steel trials, was {{converted}} to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971. In April 1973, XA903 flew with an underslung Rolls-Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. The RB.199 engine included both the reheat and <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> functions. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.|$|E
40|$|The flowfield {{within and}} around two {{dimensional}} <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> and <b>thrust</b> vectoring nozzles has been calculated {{using a new}} unfactored implicit method with a multiple zone grid. Computations are done for fully deployed <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> nozzles, partially deployed <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> nozzles with <b>thrust</b> vectoring, and a nozzle transitioning from partially to fully deployed. Agreement with available experimental data is good...|$|R
50|$|The {{go-around}} {{would have}} been successful if the left engine <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> doors had not been deployed.|$|R
50|$|If {{the full}} power of <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is not desirable, <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> can be {{operated}} with the throttle set {{at less than}} full power, even down to idle power, which reduces stress and wear on engine components. <b>Reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is sometimes selected on idling engines to eliminate residual thrust, in particular in icy or slick conditions, or when the engines' jet blast could cause damage.|$|R
5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|Air Inter {{became the}} first {{operator}} of the A330, putting the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine's <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330 {{during the second half}} of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330 on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} of earthquakes on dipping faults show asymmetric near-source ground motion {{caused by the}} asymmetric geometry of such faults. The ground motion from a <b>thrust</b> or <b>reverse</b> fault is larger {{than that of a}} normal fault by a factor of 2 or more, given identical initial stress magnitudes. The motion of the hanging wall is larger than that of the footwall in both <b>thrust</b> (<b>reverse)</b> and normal earthquakes. The asymmetry between normal and <b>thrust</b> (<b>reverse)</b> faults results from time-dependent normal stress caused by the interaction of the earthquake-generated stress field with Earth’s free surface. The asymmetry between hanging wall and footwall results from the asymmetric mass and geometry on {{the two sides of the}} fault...|$|R
40|$|Many {{airports}} {{all over}} the world have established restrictions for the use of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> for slowing down aircraft after landings, especially during the night period, as a way of reducing noise impact and the number of complaints in the vicinity of airports. This is the case of Madrid airport, where the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, in collaboration with AENA, and the Politecnico di Milano have been researching, and developing intelligent instruments to improve the detection and classification of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> noise among other noise sources present in the airport. Based on a traditional approach, the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> noise detection tool detects two consecutive sound events, and applies pattern recognition techniques for the classification of each of them (such as landing and <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse).</b> A second improvement refers to the use of a microphone array linked to a noisemonitoring unit, which enables tracking the direction of arrival of the sound, thus improving the classification rates. By taking the latter, it is also possible to track the aircraft location along the runway, which enables sound pressure measurements to be transformed into sound power level estimations. Although the novel instrument can still be optimized and customized, the results have shown quite good classification rates (over 90 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{experimental}} investigation {{focuses on}} the flow phenomena at the application of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> on a propeller equipped half-model. Lacking any visual information on this phenomenon and the inability of numerical predictions to calculate a periodically unsteady flow dominated by large regions of separation, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is very suitable for providing instantaneous and averaged velocity (and velocity-derived quantities) field data and giving insight in the flow phe-nomena occurring in these particular flows. Moreover, PIV has matured {{over the years to}} the point that sit can be readily used in industrial wind tunnels (Stanislas et al., 2000). There is a need to gain knowl-edge of the unsteady nature of propeller flow {{in order to be able}} to validate current CFD codes. Ex-perimental velocity information around the propeller at <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> also allows an identification of the unsteady behaviour of this type of flow. In addition, by comparing two different blade pitch angle settings for the same <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> force one setting is preferred...|$|R
25|$|When the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States asked Boeing to do tests {{activating}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> in flight, the FAA {{had allowed}} Boeing {{to establish the}} tests of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> Boeing had insisted that a deployment was not possible in flight. In 1982 Boeing established a test where the aircraft was slowed to 250 knots, and the test pilots then used the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> The control of the aircraft had not been jeopardized. The FAA accepted {{the results of the}} test.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> for engine #3 (treated as a minimum {{equipment}} list item) because of technical problems with the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} that the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> of the No. 2 (right side) engine {{activated}} during the climb , since one of the thrust reversers was seen {{to be in the}} deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> was a result of the accident, not a cause of it. If the reverser deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, {{it has been suggested that}} the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right. Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has tail-mounted engines positioned close to each other and to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small. Thrust reversers are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances. Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the cockpit control to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b>|$|E
40|$|The flow {{around an}} 8 -bladed {{propeller}} at <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> conditions is analysed using stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and hot film sensors in the Airbus Low-Speed Wind Tunnel facility in Bremen, Germany. The propeller {{is mounted on}} a half-model equipped with two counter-rotating propellers, where only the outboard propeller is investigated. The model is equipped with landing configuration settings at an angle of incidence of 0 ° and flaps extended. The objective is to compare the signals obtained on the wing surface with hot film sensors with flow information ob-tained with PIV directly behind the outboard propeller at <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse...</b>|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} basic {{straight}} thrust, other techniques include the <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust,</b> <b>reverse</b> flipped pierce, inwards side slashing, outwards side slashing, cobra coiled thrust, and tiger claw pierce performed by jumping towards the opponent.|$|R
40|$|An {{implicit}} {{finite volume}} method is investigated for {{the solution of}} the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows within <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> and <b>thrust</b> vectoring nozzles. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> nozzles typically have sharp corners, and the rapid expansion and large turning angles near these corners are shown to cause unacceptable time step restrictions when conventional approximate factorization methods are used. In this investigation these limitations are overcome by using second-order upwind differencing and line Gauss-Siedel relaxation. This method is implemented with a zonal mesh so that flows through complex nozzle geometries may be efficiently calculated. Results are presented for five nozzle configurations including two with time varying geometries. Three cases are compared with available experimental data and the results are generally acceptable...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{exhaust nozzle}} and jet pipe were {{designed}} {{for a life of}} 30,000 hours. The TRA (<b>Thrust</b> <b>Reverser</b> Aft) structure for a life of 40,000 hours.|$|E
25|$|The KCAB's {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} captain's misuse of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> during the landing roll and his confusion over crosswind conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Viggen was {{powered by}} a single Volvo RM8 turbofan. This was {{essentially}} a licence-built variant of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D engine that powered commercial airliners of the 1960s, with an afterburner added for the Viggen. The airframe also incorporated a <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> to use during landings and land manoeuvres, which, combined with the aircraft having flight capabilities approaching a limited STOL-like performance, enabled operations from 500m airstrips with minimal support. The <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> could be pre-selected {{in the air to}} engage when the nose-wheel strut was compressed after touchdown via a pneumatic trigger.|$|E
40|$|The flow {{around an}} 8 -bladed {{propeller}} at <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> conditions is analysed using a dou-ble stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the Airbus Low-Speed Wind Tunnel facility in Bremen, Germany. The propeller {{is mounted on}} a half-model with two counter-rotating propellers, where only the outboard propeller is investigated. The model is equipped with landing configuration settings at an angle of attack of 0 ° and flaps extended. The objective is to investigate flow phenomena occurring in the flow immediately upstream and downstream of a propeller at <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse.</b> In this respect a region of half a diameter of the outboard propeller is scanned using a traverse for both the laser light sheet and the four CCD cameras, in addition several measurements are performed at differ-ent phases of the propeller rotation. The fluid mechanical properties of the flow around two different propeller blade settings are investigated and compared {{for their ability to}} deliver negative thrust, i. e. <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse.</b> The first setting has identical blade angles for all propeller blades; the second setting has alternating different blade angles. It is concluded that the latter setting, with alternating propeller blade angles, provides the best flow properties...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of steady}} state reverse and forward to <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> {{transient}} performance tests are presented. The original quiet, clean, short haul, experimental engine four segment variable fan nozzle was retested in reverse and {{compared with a}} continuous, 30 deg half angle conical exlet. Data indicated that the significantly more stable, higher pressure recovery flow with the fixed 30 deg exlet resulted in lower engine vibrations, lower fan blade stress, and approximately a 20 percent improvement in <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust.</b> Objective <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> of 35 percent of takeoff thrust was reached. Thrust response of less than 1. 5 sec was achieved for the approach and the takeoff to <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> transients...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{two-dimensional}} wedge non-axisymmetric nozzle (2 D-AIN) {{tests to determine}} its performance relative to the baseline axisymmetric nozzle using an F- 18 jet effects wind tunnel model are presented. Configurations and test conditions simulated forward thrust-minus drag, thrust vectoring/induced lift, and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> flight conditions from Mach. 6 to 1. 20 and attack angles up to 10 degrees. Results of the model test program indicate that non-axisymmetric nozzles can be installed on a twin engine fighter aircraft model with equivalent thrust minus drag performance as the baseline axisymmetric nozzles. Thrust vectoring capability of the non-axisymmetric nozzles provided significant jet-induced lift on the nozzle/aftbody and horizontal tail surfaces. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> panels deployed from the 2 D-AIN centerbody wedge were very effective for static and inflight operatio...|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} led Boeing {{to modify}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> system to prevent similar occurrences by adding sync-locks, which prevent the thrust reversers from deploying when the main landing gear truck tilt angle is not at the ground position.|$|E
25|$|After {{bringing}} Bob and Audrey Six {{to their}} Colorado ranch, the Sabreliner crew departed Montrose Regional Airport, {{for the return}} flight to Los Angeles (LAX). The <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> of the aircraft was deployed in flight shortly after takeoff. The Sabreliner descended from , struck the ground, and was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 1973, a Sabreliner NA-265-60 {{operated}} by Continental Airlines, N743R, crashed after takeoff at Montrose Airport in Montrose, Colorado following the uncommanded {{deployment of the}} port side <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> The two pilots, the only occupants of the aircraft, were killed and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post impact fire.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Rolls-Royce/SNECMA {{tested a}} M45SD-02 {{turbofan}} fitted with {{variable pitch fan}} blades to improve handling at ultra low fan pressure ratios and to provide <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> down to zero aircraft speed. The engine was aimed at ultra quiet STOL aircraft operating from city centre airports.|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional wedge nozzle {{performance}} characteristics were investigated {{in a series}} of wind-tunnel tests. An isolated single-engine/nozzle model was used to study the effects of internal expansion area ratio, aftbody cowl boattail angle, and wedge length. An integrated twin-engine/nozzle model, tested with and without empenage surfaces, included cruise, acceleration, thrust vectoring and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> nozzle operating modes. Results indicate that the thrust-minus-aftbody drag performance of the twin two-dimensional nozzle integration is significantly higher, for speeds greater than Mach 0. 8, than the performance achieved with twin axisymmetric nozzle installations. Significant jet-induced lift was obtained on an aft-mounted lifting surface using a cambered wedge center body to vector <b>thrust.</b> The <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> capabilities of reverser panels installed on the two-dimensional wedge center body were very effective for static or in-flight operation...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the thrust-induced longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of three fighter-type configurations is presented. A brief discussion of the take-off and landing requirements {{for the next generation}} fighter aircraft leads to the conclusion that advances in lift coefficient and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> will be required to allow short-field operation. Typical power-on longitudinal aerodynamic data for the three fighter configurations, indicating different approaches to meeting the high-lift coefficient requirement, are discussed. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> is not addressed in this paper. The power-on data are analyzed to determine what power effects are present, that is, direct thrust, boundary-layer control, vortex flows, or supercirculation. The results of the analysis indicate, for the configurations studied, that induced effects are small compared to direct thrust and that boundary-layer control, rather than leading-edge vortex flows or supercirculation, is the only significant thrust-induced effect...|$|R
25|$|In 1973, two ex-Blue Angels F-11As {{were taken}} from storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and {{modified}} by Grumman as testbeds to evaluate inflight thrust control systems. BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a chase plane. Tests of the inflight thrust reversal were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at NATC Patuxent River, Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB. These were the last Tigers to fly.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} Flight 55 caused {{the crash of}} Air France Concorde Flight 4590 in Paris. The Continental DC-10 dropped a strip of titanium alloy from its <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> on the runway during takeoff. When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground. According to the official report on the accident, the strip of metal installed on the Continental jet was made from a different alloy than had {{been approved by the}} US Federal Aviation Administration or the engine manufacturer. This led French authorities to undertake a criminal investigation into Continental Airlines, which ended in Continental being fined 200,000 euros and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Saab {{finalized}} the aerodynamic {{design of}} the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted double delta wing with a small, high-set canard foreplane, equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged {{to be the best}} means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> enabled the sought short landing performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{selection}} by {{the pilot}} of the wrong mode on the onboard flight computers prevented power from being reduced to idle, which inhibited <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> and spoilers from being used. The offending engine was shut down, and brakes applied, but the aircraft was unable to stop {{before the end of}} the runway.|$|R
40|$|The key {{features}} of the integrated propulsion systems developed for short haul aircraft are discussed including the high Mach number, fixed geometry, near sonic inlet, the variable area nozzles, <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> systems, and aircraft accessory location. The roles and interplay of each element are considered and comparisons are made with conventional state-of-the-art technology...|$|R
50|$|In most cockpit setups, <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is set {{when the}} thrust levers are on idle by pulling them further back. <b>Reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is {{typically}} applied immediately after touchdown, often along with spoilers, to improve deceleration {{early in the}} landing roll when residual aerodynamic lift and high speed limit {{the effectiveness of the}} brakes located on the landing gear. <b>Reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is always selected manually, either using levers attached to the thrust levers or moving the thrust levers into a <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> 'gate'.|$|R
