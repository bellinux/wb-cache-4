5|$|Allen {{worked for}} the NFL Network, Sky Sports NFL, and the Big Ten Network as a game-day analyst in the years {{following}} his retirement from football. He also co-hosted the radio broadcast Inside the <b>Trenches</b> with former NFL defensive linemen R-Kal Truluck and Lance Legree. Inside the <b>Trenches</b> aimed to provide the perspective of offensive and defensive linemen while discussing professional football.|$|E
5|$|His {{story is}} {{interleaved}} {{with that of}} Jack Firebrace, a former miner employed with the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers in the British <b>trenches</b> to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the German <b>trenches.</b> In one expedition across No-Man's Land, Stephen is badly injured but survives.|$|E

50|$|A {{traverse}} <b>trench</b> is a <b>trench</b> dug {{perpendicular to}} a <b>trench</b> line, but extending {{away from the}} enemy. It has two functions. One function {{is to provide a}}n entry into the main <b>trench.</b> A second function is to provide a place for defenders to shelter and regroup should the enemy have penetrated into the main <b>trench</b> and be able to fire down the main <b>trench's</b> length.|$|R
5|$|In early June 1916, the Canadian Corps {{was again}} posted to <b>trenches</b> around the Belgian town of Ypres. The new {{commander}} of the Canadian Corps, Julian Byng, was inspecting the Corps positions {{in front of a}} German-held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire. The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap <b>trenches</b> which implied that an assault was intended. Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the front line and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a local attack. Mercer complied on the 2 June, conducting a standard inspection of front line Canadian <b>trenches</b> at 08:30.|$|E
5|$|Petrol cans {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted <b>trenches</b> near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit <b>trenches.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Luna Defense Line {{was planned}} {{to create a}} series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was {{constructing}} a guerrilla base in the Mountain Province. The base was planned {{to be the last}} stand headquarters of the Republic in the case the Americans broke through the Defense Line. American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which they described as consisting of numerous bamboo <b>trenches</b> stretching from town to town. The series of <b>trenches</b> allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As the American troops occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the <b>trenches,</b> which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles.|$|E
50|$|A {{traverse}} in <b>trench</b> warfare is {{an adaptation}} to reduce casualties to defenders occupying a <b>trench.</b> One form of traverse is a U-shaped detour in the <b>trench</b> with the <b>trench</b> going around a protrusion formed {{of earth and}} sandbags. The fragments or shrapnel, or shockwave from a shell landing and exploding within a <b>trench</b> then cannot spread past the obstacle the traverse interposes. Also, an enemy that has entered a <b>trench</b> is unable to fire down the length at the defenders, or otherwise enfilade the <b>trench.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Trench</b> family claims French Huguenot descent, {{although}} a Scottish origin is possible. The Barons Ashtown {{are members of}} another branch of the family. William <b>Trench,</b> 1st Earl of Clancarty, was the great-grandson of Frederick <b>Trench,</b> whose brother the Very Reverend John <b>Trench</b> was the great-grandfather of Frederick <b>Trench,</b> 1st Baron Ashtown.|$|R
50|$|The Kuril-Kamchatka <b>Trench</b> or Kuril <b>Trench</b> (Курило-Камчатский жёлоб, Kurilo-Kamchatkii Zhyolob) is an oceanic <b>trench</b> in the {{northwest}} Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the Kuril Island chain to meet the Japan <b>Trench</b> east of Hokkaido. It extends from a triple junction with the Ulakhan Fault and the Aleutian <b>Trench</b> near the Commander Islands, Russia, in the northeast, to the intersection with the Japan <b>Trench</b> in the southwest.|$|R
5|$|The {{two lines}} of <b>trenches</b> faced each other, manned by {{soldiers}} living in appalling conditions of cold, damp and filth.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} <b>trenches</b> {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by {{communication}} <b>trenches.</b> The <b>trenches</b> varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire <b>trenches</b> were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E

50|$|A second <b>trench</b> is then started, {{backfilling}} {{the first}} <b>trench.</b> This process is repeated until the whole bed has been treated. There will be soil {{left over from}} the first <b>trench,</b> which is used to fill the last <b>trench.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Farallon <b>Trench</b> was {{an ancient}} oceanic <b>trench</b> {{on the west}} coast of North America during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. The <b>trench</b> started disappearing when the Farallon Plate began subducting under the North American Plate. The Subduction of oceanic {{lithosphere}} occurs through <b>trench</b> migration. So that after the Farallon Plate completely subducted, there are only Juan de Fuca Plate remaining. The Farallon <b>Trench</b> then turned into the San Andreas Fault. Since then, it has spread out to the north, <b>trench</b> above Juan De Fuca Plate, and south, <b>trench</b> above Central America. The time duration of subduction began from 165 Ma, Farallon <b>Trench</b> replacing the Mezczlera promontory, till 5 Ma, San Andreas fault straightening.|$|R

5|$|By October 5, Washington {{was almost}} ready to open the first parallel. That night the sappers and miners worked, putting strips of pine on the wet sand to mark {{the path of the}} <b>trenches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the <b>trenches</b> at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} {{deadlock}} as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the <b>trenches</b> even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the <b>trenches</b> in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the <b>trenches,</b> is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
50|$|The Intermontane <b>Trench</b> was {{an ancient}} oceanic <b>trench</b> during the Triassic. The <b>trench</b> was {{probably}} 600 to 800 miles long, {{parallel to the}} west coast of North America. The ocean that the <b>trench</b> was located in was called the Slide Mountain Ocean.|$|R

50|$|The eastern {{boundaries}} of the Tonga and Kermadec Plates constitute the subduction zone of the Pacific Plate, characterized by a <b>trench</b> about 2,000 km in length. The <b>trench</b> is continuous, but has different names for different sections: Hikurangi Trough, the Kermadec <b>Trench</b> and the Tonga <b>Trench.</b> The Tonga <b>Trench</b> is the second deepest <b>trench</b> {{in the world at}} about 10,800 m, with the deepest point, Horizon Deep, being the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere and the second deepest point in the world, after the Challenger Deep in the Mariana <b>Trench.</b> The eastern boundary of the Kermadec Plate is also the site of the Kermadec <b>Trench,</b> which is the fifth deepest <b>trench</b> in the world at about 10,000 m. The eastern boundary of the Tonga Plate is one of the fastest subduction zones with a rate of up to 24cm/yr.|$|R
5|$|In April 1863, {{the fort}} was {{named in honor}} of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by <b>trenches</b> and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the <b>trenches</b> in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort.|$|E
5|$|In April and June 1916 the {{battalion}} suffered casualties of well over 500 in two serious gas attacks, on both occasions when in <b>trenches</b> north of Wulverghem (near Messines).|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, on the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Blackader was in India, commanding the 2nd Battalion of the Leicesters, which was mobilised for service as part of the 20th (Garhwal) Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division. The division was sent to France as part of Indian Expeditionary Force A, seeing its first action in the <b>trenches</b> on 29 October. On 19 December a force under Blackader's command staged a successful attack on the German <b>trenches,</b> though the attack was overshadowed {{by the beginning of the}} German attack on Givenchy the following day, through which the Leicesters remained in reserve.|$|E
5000|$|On an {{approach}} <b>trench,</b> that is, a <b>trench</b> {{leading from the}} rear to the frontline or firing <b>trench,</b> defenders may construct an island traverse.

2500|$|A similar {{relationship}} between proximity to rivers, forearc width, and <b>trench</b> morphology {{can be observed}} {{from east to west}} along the Alaskan-Aleutian convergent margin. The convergent plate boundary offshore Alaska changes along its strike from a filled <b>trench</b> with broad forearc in the east (near the coastal rivers of Alaska) to a deep <b>trench</b> with narrow forearc in the west (offshore the Aleutian islands). Another example is the Makran convergent margin offshore Pakistan and Iran, which is a <b>trench</b> filled by sediments from the Tigris-Euphrates and Indus rivers. [...] Thick accumulations of turbidites along a <b>trench</b> can be supplied by down-axis transport of sediments that enter the <b>trench</b> [...] away, as is found for the Peru–Chile <b>Trench</b> south of Valparaíso and for the Aleutian <b>Trench.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 6300 m deep Puysegur <b>Trench</b> {{is a deep}} cleft in {{the floor}} of the south Tasman Sea formed by the {{subduction}} of the Indo-Australian Plate under the Pacific Plate to the south of New Zealand. Immediately to its east lies a ridge, a northern extension of the Macquarie Ridge, which separates the Puysegur <b>Trench</b> from the Solander Trough. To the west is the expanse of the Tasman Basin, which stretches most of the distance to Australia. To the north of the <b>trench</b> lies the Fiordland Basin, which can be considered an extension of the <b>trench.</b> The Puysegur <b>Trench</b> mirrors the Kermadec <b>Trench</b> and Tonga <b>Trench</b> north of New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|In Jilib, the Islamists used bulldozers {{to prepare}} <b>trenches</b> and {{defensive}} positions. They had about 3,000 fighters and 60 technicals mounted with antiaircraft and antitank guns. Up to 4,700 people fled the area {{ahead of the}} fighting.|$|E
