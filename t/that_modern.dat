5|$|Current historiography {{developed}} in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions {{for the development of}} elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Friedman {{graduated}} from Rutgers University, where he specialized {{in mathematics and}} economics and initially intended to become an actuary.

5|$|The RNA world {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} RNA was once both the carrier of hereditary information and enzymatically active, with different sequences acting as biocatalysts, regulators and sensors.

5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> viewers {{would find}} relatively minor were noted in their day. In the attic scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use of harsh lighting conditions to create ambiance and indicate a dangerous setting.

5|$|Archaeological evidence, {{such as the}} Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also {{supports}} some of Herodotus' specific claims. George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow pass at Thermopylae, {{and to the extent}} <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's.

Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the Rosetta Stone, <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} statues of Amenhotep have been found, {{but they are}} mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his {{continuing}} funerary cult, made for his posthumous funerary cult. This makes study {{of the art of}} his reign difficult. Based upon his few authentic statues, it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles. Art in the early 18th dynasty was particularly {{similar to that of the}} early Middle Kingdom, and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I. The two types are so similar <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> Egyptologists have had trouble telling the two apart.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic studies {{initially}} {{suggested that}} most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 {{million years ago}} and <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. However, no placental fossils have been found from {{before the end of}} the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In particular, scientists have identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. however it has been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian. Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has <b>that</b> <b>modern</b> sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
