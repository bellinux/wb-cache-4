5|$|Written by Pat Mills & John Wagner, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} around the start of 1979. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> involve a parallel universe in which the Roman Empire never fell. Mills & Wagner subsequently adapted it to become the comic story The Iron Legion for Doctor Who Weekly in late 1979.|$|E
5|$|Following the Marquess' death, {{his agent}} hoped that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> {{serve as a}} warning over the dangers of drug addiction. Ickworth Church, which the 7th Marquess had bought in 1986 after commissioners {{declared}} it redundant, was inherited by the 8th Marquess and restored with a Heritage Lottery grant. The East Wing of Ickworth House was converted by the National Trust into a luxury hotel in 2002.|$|E

5000|$|Roy Raymond was {{the host}} of a {{television}} show called Impossible...

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to the writing of the poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E
5|$|O'Bannon {{had written}} 29 {{pages of a}} script titled Memory, {{containing}} {{what would become the}} opening scenes of Alien: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious planetoid. They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface. He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
50|$|Each season {{had several}} {{recurring}} characters with each episode focused on {{two or three}} specific characters with plotlines presented as interweaved vignettes. Each season had stories end while others were still running and <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> run for various lengths of time. Undressed ran for six seasons, from July 26, 1999 to September 5, 2002.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} three generations of Merriwells: Frank, his {{half-brother}} Dick, and Frank's son, Frank Jr. There is a marked difference between Frank and Dick. Frank usually handled challenges on his own. Dick has mysterious friends and skills that help him, especially an old Indian friend without whom <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> not have been quite as interesting.|$|R

5|$|Written by Lewis Greifer, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} in July 1974. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> involve museum keepers being chased out of the British Museum by a mummy. It would turn out that a group was scaring people away {{in order to gain}} access to a sarcophagus which would contain wild rice from thousands of years ago. The group wanted to use the rice to seed Mars and make a fortune. It was replaced by Robert Holmes' Pyramids of Mars when Griefer fell ill and the scripts came in late and were not what the production team wanted.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and that the rest of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51. However, he killed himself, as well as his wife and pets, a decade after the game's release, and no sequel was ever completed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003, the {{characters}} from Spica (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced {{and in the}} January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by Chitose Maki; the reader participation game began in this issue. Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine. Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.|$|E

50|$|The paper {{generally}} contained 4-5 serial story installments, {{printed in}} very small text (the paper was 16 pages long). A 10,000 word complete story was also presented in each issue. <b>The</b> order of <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> be rotated {{so that each}} serial had an instalment on the cover (with accompanying large title and illustration). At other times <b>the</b> complete <b>story</b> <b>would</b> feature on <b>the</b> cover.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} Departures arose after Motoki, {{affected}} by having seen a funeral ceremony along the Ganges when travelling in India, read widely {{on the subject}} of death and came across Coffinman. He felt that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> adapt well to film, and Departures was finished a decade later. Because of Japanese prejudices against those who handle the dead, distributors were reluctant to release it—until a surprise grand prize win at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 2008. The following month the film opened in Japan, where it {{went on to win the}} Academy Prize for Picture of the Year and become the year's highest-grossing domestic film. This success was topped in 2009, when it became the first Japanese production to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
5|$|Written by Douglas Camfield, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 January 1976. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> involve the Doctor and Sarah arriving in North Africa at an isolated French Legion outpost. This {{has become the}} battleground for a fight between two alien races, the Skarkel and Khoorians. The story was planned to write out the character of Sarah and would see Sarah killed {{by one of the}} aliens. The first script was submitted on 9 February 1976 and removed from the series schedule in April 1976. Camfield would continue to work on the scripts, delivering the final part on 24 September 1976, but the production team were no longer interested in pursuing the story.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mervyn Haisman & Henry Lincoln, this storyline was {{considered}} around mid-1968. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> {{be set in}} Scotland in Jamie's ancestral home, Castle McCrimmon, where the Doctor's old foe the Great Intelligence plans to use Jamie's body. At {{the end of the}} story Jamie would remain behind as the new laird. By late April 1968, it was clear that Frazer Hines would be leaving the series sometime during Season Six. One candidate for his departure story was Haisman and Lincoln's third Yeti serial, which they were working on around the start of June. Over the summer, however, the writers became embroiled in a dispute over copyright with the BBC regarding the Quarks, robot monsters which had appeared in their previous Doctor Who commission, The Dominators. The ensuing acrimony resulted in the abandonment of The Laird of McCrimmon during August 1968.|$|E

5000|$|In High Society, {{each issue}} of Cerebus {{comprised}} one chapter of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> but as <b>the</b> series progressed, Sim came to compose <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> with <b>the</b> collected volumes in mind. This meant that <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> be serialized in {{the comic book}} in twenty-page installments, but {{with little regard for}} the per-issue reading experiencesometimes an issue would end mid-scene. [...] Many fans started waiting for the collected volumes to be released, abandoning the monthly seriesa phenomenon that {{came to be known as}} [...] "The Cerebus Effect".|$|R
5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Torishima said he chose it largely {{because it was a}} free {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. Slumps West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in Journey to the West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} {{previous}} volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, The Red Sea Sharks was created {{with the aid of}} Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Hergé used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier installments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world, however in the 1960s <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> generate controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Red Sea Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir {{with whom he}} had worked before. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat-people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> be impossible to shoot on Doctor Whos budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 Darwyn Cooke {{was brought}} on {{to develop a}} new all-ages book based on Marvel's heroes. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> be {{independent}} from the Marvel 616 Universe and feature an array of Marvel's most popular characters. Cooke was eventually left behind by Marvel and the book carried on without him where a new batch of creators were brought on to tell stories Cooke never intended to tell. The Marvel Age imprint was relaunched as Marvel Adventures, with Marvel Age: Spider-Man and Marvel Age: Fantastic Four being restarted as Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man and Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four. This time around, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>would</b> be original and not based on existing stories. In {{order to be able to}} tell standalone stories and to escape the trappings of having to reflect the events of other Marvel titles, none of the titles take place within the primary Marvel Universe continuity. Each title under the Marvel Adventures imprint seems to have its own continuity set apart from the other titles. In some instances, multiple continuities have even been used within single titles.|$|R
5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog began {{developing}} The Last of Us: Left Behind {{following the}} release of The Last of Us in June 2013, with a team about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> focus {{on the character of}} Ellie; they found that players of The Last of Us were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in The Last of Us. In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of Left Behind.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>would</b> open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
