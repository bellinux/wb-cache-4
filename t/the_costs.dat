5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

50|$|A {{second point}} about free permits (usually “grandfathered,” i.e. given out in {{proportion}} to past emissions) has often been misunderstood.

With auctioned permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> is obvious. With free permits, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> is <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of not selling the permit at full value — this is termed an “opportunity cost.” Since <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of emissions is generally a marginal cost (increasing with output), <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> is passed on by raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of output (e.g. raising <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of gasoline or electricity).|$|R
