40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} focused on the {{effectiveness}} of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> for people with cooccurring disorders (CODs) within the criminal justice system (CJS). However, there has been a paucity of research on the effectiveness of community-integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> with CODs and influences on decreasing their interaction within the CJS. This study quantitatively examined the possible relationships between integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> and CODs and their effect on decreasing interactions within the CJS. The sample (N = 320) consisted of people with CODs from a community-based facility. The statistical analysis was a 2 -way (2 x 2) and 3 -way (2 x 2 x 2) mixed factorial analysis of variance. Results indicated a statistically significant difference in the number of interactions within the CJS between integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> and single <b>treatment</b> <b>services,</b> as well as a statistically nonsignificant difference between male and female. Future studies are recommended to examine the predictive value of the long-term effects of integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> in decreasing interactions within the CJS. The social implications of the study could be integral to community behavioral health care agencies and administrators of correctional institutions in demonstrating how pertinent integrated <b>treatment</b> <b>services</b> can be in decreasing the overrepresentation of people with CODs within the CJS. Furthermore, it will contribute to the continuous need for developing evidence-based programming and practices for CODs within community-based programs, increasing public safety to communities, and the tremendous cost-effectiveness to correctional programs...|$|R
