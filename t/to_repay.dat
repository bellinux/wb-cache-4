50|$|Financial aid is {{available}} to students on need-based merit.

40|$|Once a {{regulated}} utility {{has made}} an irreversible capital investment, that investment becomes vulnerable to appropriation by a regulator. This Article explores the incentives and strategies of the investor, the consumer, and the regulator-before and after capital investments are sunk-within a game-based model of regulation. A regulator, even one whose allegiance lies wholly with consumers, will find it advantageous <b>to</b> commit <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> investor capital. A consumer gains when regulatory commitment <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> capital is made less fragile. Commitment often does not {{take the form of}} a promise or contract. Historically, the most important force for keeping regulators faithful has been the continuing need for future investment. New methods for making commitments more sturdy include adopting technologies that result in small repeated investments, greater use of market transactions, and regulator involvement in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s planning decisions...|$|R

5|$|Most of Jennings {{second term}} was spent {{grappling}} with the state's continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state's revenue was not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate {{the value of its}} bonds, harming the state's credit and making it difficult to secure new loans.|$|E

5|$|The city of Eretria {{also sent}} {{assistance}} to the Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear.

5|$|The {{current and}} past highway commissioners were accused of {{incompetence}} and embezzlement and forced <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> money. According to Suetonius, {{in the first year}} of Caligula's reign he squandered 2.7 billion sesterces that Tiberius had amassed. His nephew Nero Caesar both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{felt the}} contractors could not complete {{the program and}} instructed them <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development.

The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and remain an issue of controversy, with suggestions of political expediency and scheming to be behind the action.|$|E

50|$|The formal {{subscription}} proceeded {{and four}} members of the Harris family—proprietors of the bacon factory—subscribed over 50% of the capital. All seemed to be going well but a disturbing letter was soon received: it had been understood that the GWR would be supportive, but the letter warned that income on the line might not cover the operating costs of the line for several years, and that any profits would fail <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> the capital cost.|$|R
5|$|The harbour {{cost more}} than {{anticipated}} and high rates were levied <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> loans, reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new lock gates, a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce siltation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Iowa-class battleships, New Jersey was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> a {{political}} debt, to then-New Jersey Governor Charles Edison. During {{his time in}} the Navy department, Edison pushed to build the Iowas, and to build one at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which secured votes for Roosevelt in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the 1940 presidential election.|$|E
50|$|Although arguably an IVA {{is seen as}} more {{positive}} than bankruptcy {{in the eyes of}} creditors, as it shows a certain commitment <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> debt, in reality an IVA is likely to have an equally detrimental effect on a debtor's credit rating as bankruptcy. Usually a debtor's credit rating is already poor before an IVA or bankruptcy is considered however. Both bankruptcy and an IVA will stay on a debtor's credit file for six years {{from the start of the}} IVA or bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|Girin: Manoroma's {{cousin and}} a {{university}} student who as been away for many years. He, {{as with the}} rest of the family, is a Brahmo, and convinces Gurucharan to convert himself (and his family). As a Brahmo, Gurucharan will no longer have to pay large dowries for the weddings of his daughters. In addition <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> Gurucharan's loan, Girin repeatedly proves himself to be a man of integrity who acts according to the common good rather than his own self-interest.|$|R
50|$|In Chapter 13, {{the debtor}} retains {{ownership}} {{and possession of}} all {{of his or her}} assets, but must devote some portion of his or her future income <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> creditors, generally over a period of three to five years. The amount of payment and the period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.|$|R

5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order <b>to</b> <b>repay</b> the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{social and}} {{political}} unrest, the economy continued to flourish under the authoritarian rule with the export-based industrialization policy. The first two five-year economic development plans were successful, and the 3rd and 4th five-year plans focused on expanding the heavy and chemical industries, raising the capability for steel production and oil refining. However, large conglomerate chaebols continuously received preferential treatment and came to dominate the domestic market. As most of the development had come from foreign capital, most of the profit went back <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> the loans and interest.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1988 match, anti-German {{sentiment}} {{became much}} less prominent among the Dutch, as defeating the Germans {{and going on}} to win the cup, in Germany itself, was to many the closest they would ever come <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> Germany. It also marked a new phase in the rivalry because with the war-related sentiment lessened on the Dutch side, the Germans now as a consequence also became far more vocal about the football rivalry, which they had avoided previously. The rivalry continued, but the tone (though still highly competitive) became less aggressive.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2014, {{the provincial}} {{minister}} responsible for housing Rich Coleman disclosed that an external audit by accounting firm KPMG found {{serious concerns about}} administration costs and perks for staff.

Kwan said she was unaware until the audit was published that vacation costs were paid by PHS and committed <b>to</b> <b>repaying</b> $35,000 for that and another trip.|$|R
