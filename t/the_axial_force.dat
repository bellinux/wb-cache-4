50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|E
50|$|Determination of {{the maximum}} axial force for two pieces joined by {{adhesive}} can easily be determined using two equations that {{can be derived from}} the geometry of the problem by breaking <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the scarf joint. Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum axial force are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude {{of the maximum}} allowable axial force. The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：The seismic {{response}} of slope supported by composite soil nailing is analyzed by using finite element software ADNIA, {{in which the}} EL-Centro wave is selected as input earthquake wave. The analytical contents include the displacement and acceleration of supporting slope, {{as well as the}} time history responses of <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> of anchors. In the establishment of finite element model, the interaction between soil body and supporting structure is considered. The elastic-plastic M-C model with nonlinear static and dynamic behavior is used to simulate the soil body, and the dual linear strengthen model is adopted to simulate the supporting structure, then the interaction between soil body and supporting structure is simulated with contact element. The results show that the composite soil nailing slope supporting structure has better seismic performance than the general soil nailing slope supporting structure. The maximum horizontal displacement of the latter occurs at the slope top, but that of the former occurs at the slope upper. Especially after the imposition of the prestress, the slope displacement under earthquake reduces significantly, and <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> of anchors under earthquake enlarge significantly.

40|$|It is {{reported}} in the published literature that the resonant frequency of a silicon micromachined gyroscope decreases linearly with increasing temperature. However, when <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> is considerable, the resonant frequency might increase as the temperature increases. <b>The</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> is mainly induced by thermal stress due to the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the structure and substrate. In this paper, two types of micromachined suspended vibratory gyroscopes with slanted beams were proposed to evaluate the effect of <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> One type was suspended with a clamped-free (C-F) beam {{and the other one}} was suspended with a clamped-clamped (C-C) beam.

The example considered is a portal framewhich is composed of two identical columns and a rigid beam, and is subjected to a constantvertical load and to a varying horizontal force. The relation between the horizontal force andthe displacement is sought when the latter increases monotonously. Large elastic-plastic de-formation causes the interaction of plastic collapse and the instability which is due to change ingeometry. The beam shear increases the compressive axial force in one column and decreasesin the other, so that <b>the</b> <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> variation gives rise to the addition of folds in the horizontalforce-displacement diagram. In the case of a small vertical load, an initially compressive axial forceeven becomes tensile in the course of horizontal force application.
