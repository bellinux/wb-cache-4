5|$|One of the {{earliest}} successes in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>was</b> in controlling Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect Rodolia cardinalis (the vedalia beetle).

5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>was</b> active. The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with a Volcano explosivity index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to Santorini and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was released to <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>was</b> automatically granted West German rights including residence, {{the right to}} work, and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's time in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>was</b> brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Her {{other early}} film roles {{included}} in George Stevens' Giant (1956), playing the love interest of James Dean, {{and in the}} romantic comedy But Not for Me (1959). In 1961, Baker appeared in the controversial independent film Something Wild, directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein, playing a traumatized rape victim. She went on to star in several critically acclaimed Westerns throughout the 1960s, such as The Big Country (1958), How <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Was</b> Won (1962), and Cheyenne Autumn (1964).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} Nigeria's major ethnic groups, the Hausa ethnic group (predominant in the north) {{was found to}} be 95% Muslim and 5% Christian, the Yoruba tribe (predominant in <b>the</b> <b>west)</b> <b>was</b> 55% Muslim, 35% Christian and 10% adherents of other religions, while the Igbos (predominant in the east) and the Ijaw (south) were 98% Christian, with 2% practising {{traditional}} religions. The middle belt of Nigeria contains the largest number of minority ethnic groups in Nigeria, who were found to be mostly Christians and members of traditional religions, with a small proportion of Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Marquis' {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>was</b> first sparked in 1890 by stories from three fellow printers {{who had spent}} a year there. Marquis and a colleague at the Herald resolved to save for a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{its course}} is through low-lying {{land that is}} at or just above sea level, and regular {{flooding}} has been a long-standing problem along the waterway. Drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed {{on both sides of}} the river. The Holderness Drainage scheme to the east was completed in 1772, with a second phase in 1805, and the Beverley and Barmston Drain to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1810. Since 1980, the mouth of the river has been protected by a tidal barrier at the estuary, which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering the river system and causing flooding upriver.|$|E
5|$|Several states {{claimed to}} be the Roman Empire's successors {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire, an attempt to resurrect the Empire in <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 800 when Pope LeoIII crowned Frankish King Charlemagne as Roman Emperor on Christmas Day, though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalized for some decades. After the fall of Constantinople, the Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second). These concepts are known as Translatio imperii.|$|E

5|$|The California Highway Commission {{considered}} several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was {{too long}} and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>was</b> rejected because of {{a proposal for a}} dam. This route was later chosen for the Ridge Route Alternate, but had to be abandoned in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Arts and Crafts, {{subordinate}} to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, bronze mirrors, vessel wares, and other goods. The Office of Manufactures, also {{subordinate to}} the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and armor. Textiles and clothing worn by the emperor and royal family {{were made in the}} Weaving House of the West and Weaving House of the East; the latter was abolished in 28 BC, and the Weaving House of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Weaving House.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>was</b> able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was {{in stark contrast to}} the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
