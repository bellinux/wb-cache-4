25|$|A binary {{resonance}} {{ratio in}} <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> {{be interpreted as}} the ratio of number of orbits completed {{in the same time}} interval, rather than as the ratio of orbital periods, which would be the inverse ratio. Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits {{in the time it takes}} Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships between three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.|$|E
2500|$|Attachment {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} category of alternative child mental health interventions intended to treat attachment disorders. The term generally includes accompanying parenting techniques. Other names or particular techniques include [...] "the Evergreen model", [...] "holding time", [...] "rage-reduction", [...] "compression therapy", [...] "rebirthing", [...] "corrective attachment therapy" [...] and Coercive Restraint Therapy. It is found {{primarily in the}} United States, {{and much of it}} is centered in about a dozen clinics in Evergreen, Colorado, where Foster Cline, one of the founders, established his clinic in the 1970s. This article describes this particular set of interventions although in clinical literature the term [...] "attachment therapy" [...] is sometimes used loosely to mean any intervention based on attachment theory, particularly outside the US. Attachment therapy as described in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> not be confused with other schools of therapy which are more empirically based and which aim to address problems stemming from disrupted attachment to caregivers.|$|E

60|$|That dog {{spends about}} half his elegant leisure in devouring the cold victuals of compassion, {{and the other}} half in running after the bricks of which he is the {{provocation}} and we are the target. Within the last six years we employed as editors upon the unhappy journal which it was intended that <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> redeem, no less than sixteen pickpockets, hoping they would steal him; but with an acute intelligence of which their writing conveyed but an imperfect idea, they shunned the glittering bait, as one walks to windward of the deadly upas tree. We have given him away to friends until we haven't a friend left; we have offered him at auction-sales, and been ourselves knocked down; we have decoyed him into strange places and abandoned him, until we are poor from the payment of unpromised rewards. In the character of a charitable donation he has been driven from the door of every orphan asylum, foundling hospital, and reform school in the State. Not a week passes but we forfeit exemplary damages for inciting him to fall foul of passing gentlemen, in the vain hope of getting him slain.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mainstream}} {{transition to}} the use of stem-wind, stem-set watches occurred at around {{the same time as the}} end of the manufacture and use of the fusee watch.
