5|$|Telescopic {{observations}} in the mid-20th century began <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at Io's unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io's surface was devoid of water ice (a substance {{found to be}} plentiful on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io's influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, as demonstrated by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.|$|E
5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
30|$|Three {{factors were}} used to {{investigate}} {{differences between the two}} sample populations that may explain why findings in the summer study did not replicate to the academic year study: prior knowledge, problem difficulty, and students’ help-seeking behavior. Measures from the data collected {{were used to}} describe these factors. On the one hand, students from the academic year sample population appeared to have less prior knowledge, experienced more difficulty answering problems, and sought more help, wherein earlier access <b>to</b> <b>hints</b> helped them perform better than students with later access <b>to</b> <b>hints.</b> On the other hand, students from the summer sample population appeared to have more prior knowledge, experienced less difficulty answering problems, and sought less help, wherein earlier access <b>to</b> <b>hints</b> was not any better than later access <b>to</b> <b>hints.</b>|$|R

The RAF flew {{reconnaissance}} flights across the supposed targets, whilst the Navy set up major {{facilities in the}} Syrian coastal ports (anti-aircraft guns, search lights and other efforts that might hide major activity). Along the Turkish border the British Ninth Army (the small force protecting Syria), the 31st Indian Armoured Division and 20th Armoured Division (a fictional division, really the dummy tanks of Jones' 24th Armoured Brigade) {{put on a show}} of readiness. Political deception, via Royal Flush, was also used <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> heavily at Allied actions in the region.|$|E
5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative {{of her story}} in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose hero is Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E

The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E
5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance of strength and sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Vortigaunts {{were planned}} to begin Half-Life as enemy non-player characters, which the player {{has to win}} over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved {{impractical}} and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries. The plan re-emerged for Half-Life 2, in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2 were originally going to be fully integrated in City 17 alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game {{taking place in the}} countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game. Midway through Half-Life 2, the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, {{but it was too late}} in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in Episode Two. The concept was later showcased in an Episode Two trailer shown at the Games Convention in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created {{its first}} soap opera, and {{significantly}} Australia's first teen soap opera, Class of '74.

25|$|Shore {{also uses}} his themes subtly to inform {{dramatic}} connections, rather than serve strictly as a musical stand-in for characters. A {{good example is}} how Shore forms the first notes of the fellowship theme over Sam joining Frodo, and expanding on it when Merry, Pippin and Strider join the group <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the gradual coming together of the Fellowship of the Ring and {{leading up to the}} full statement in the council of Elrond. There is even significance as to the order in which themes appear in a scene or to when a theme is absent.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Mystics, Froud portrayed {{them as being}} more connected to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey {{the idea that they}} were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson himself could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting of}} Lullaby is {{constantly}} changing. In both {{the present tense}} narration and the story he is reflecting on, Streator is constantly moving in pursuit of something. He works {{in a big city}} atmosphere and lives in an apartment surrounded by other tenants who become symbolic of everything Streator hates. Soon after he meets Helen, they start their cross-country mission. Most of the towns they end up in are small, nowhere places that seem to represent the emptiness that the culling song creates in people lives. Similarly, the trucker stops that Streator and Helen drive through in their present-day adventure are representative of how the stories that they are chasing are temporary. The idea that a story is always told ‘after the fact’ seems <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at a bigger picture: humans are a victim of their past.|$|E

25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E
500|$|A major {{character}} in film Planet 51, an alien Lem, was named [...] by screenwriter Joe Stillman after Stanisław Lem.

500|$|Harry Flynn is a {{longtime}} business associate of Drake's and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Steve Valentine. In the second game, he approaches Drake, convincing him to [...] help steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum for a wealthy client. The two, along with Frazer, plan to keep the lamp for themselves, believing {{it will lead to}} the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and the treasures it holds. In reality, Flynn is working for Lazarevic, and betrays Drake, taking the location coordinates and landing Drake in prison. He then works with Lazarevic in searching for the Cintamani Stone. When Lazarevic apprehends Drake, he has Flynn force him to find the location of the entrance to Shambhala. [...] There, Lazarevic and his men, Flynn, Drake and company are attacked by the Guardians, where Flynn is gravely wounded due to a gunshot wound from Lazarevic, his employer having clearly grown tired of his failures. Flynn ultimately commits suicide while attempting to blow up Drake but severely wounds Fisher with a grenade. Naughty Dog used the dialog in the game <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the relationship between Drake and Flynn, but desired ambiguity regarding the exact nature of their past dealings, and to show what Drake could have become. Flynn mainly served <b>to</b> <b>hint</b> at the darker past where Drake performed less heroic activities. Flynn was not written as a British character; the casting of a British actor was mere coincidence.|$|E
50|$|While {{the album}} has {{received}} some criticism for its slicker, polished sound, Foreign Legion continued {{to widen the}} band's fanbase and featured the trademark Fluid Ounces variety of eclectic musical styles, ranging from playful boogie-woogie ("Poet Tree") and lush balladry ("The Last Thing") <b>to</b> <b>hints</b> of Latin ("Encyclopedia Brown") and psychedelia ("Stark Raving Mad").|$|R
50|$|At the time, the {{technology}} for including these hints in fonts was carefully guarded, and the hinted fonts were compressed and encrypted into what Adobe called a Type 1 Font (also known as PostScript Type 1 Font, PS1, T1 or Adobe Type 1). Type 1 was effectively a simplification of the PS system to store outline information only, {{as opposed to being}} a complete language (PDF is similar in this regard). Adobe would then sell licenses to the Type 1 technology to those wanting <b>to</b> add <b>hints</b> <b>to</b> their own fonts. Those who did not license {{the technology}} were left with the Type 3 Font (also known as PostScript Type 3 Font, PS3 or T3).
