5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with <b>the</b> <b>transactions.</b> This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, the Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea acufera, later {{identified as}} a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown. I.anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon (Isopogon anethifolius) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to {{the natural order of}} Proteeae. Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae in <b>the</b> <b>Transactions</b> of the Linnean Society in 1810.|$|E

50|$|Whenever a {{transaction}} begins, it receives a timestamp.

However, if the operation of <b>the</b> wrong <b>transaction</b> is actually presented first, then it is aborted and <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> must be restarted.|$|R
5|$|In 1988 Playtex {{split into}} two companies, Playtex Apparel and Playtex Family Products, {{in a series of}} {{financial}} transactions totaling $1.3 billion. <b>The</b> <b>transactions</b> allowed Smilow to buy out other Playtex shareholders and put ownership of the brand into two separate investment groups that were owned by Smilow and other Playtex executives. In 1990 Playtex Products acquired cosmetics brand Maybelline for $300 million.($ in modern dollars). The next year Smilow sold Playtex Apparel to the Sara Lee Corporation, transferring the Bali, Hanes, and Cross Your Heart brands for $571 million, ($ in modern dollars) but keeping the Playtex Family Products Corporation.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007 it {{was found}} that when {{customers}} added value to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.|$|E

5|$|In April 1824, Rincón mayor Pedro García {{authorized}} {{the sale of}} a vessel owned by Juan Bautista de Salas to Pedro Ramírez. Ramírez, who may have {{been a member of the}} Ramírez de Arellano family, lived in Pedernales and was a neighbor of Cofresí's brothers and Cristobal Pabón Davila. On April 30, shortly after acquiring the ship, Ramírez sold it to Cofresí (who used it as a pirate flagship). The irregularity of <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> was quickly noticed, prompting an investigation of García. The scandal weakened his already-frail authority, and Matías Conchuela intervened as the governor's representative. De la Torre asked the mayor of Añasco, Thomás de la Concha, to retrieve the records and verify their accuracy. The investigation, led by public prosecutor José Madrazo of the Regimiento de Granada's Military Anti-Piracy Commission, concluded with Bautista's imprisonment and sanctions for García. Several members of the Ramírez de Arellano family were prosecuted, including the former mayors of Añasco and Mayagüez (Manuel and José María), Tómas and Antonio. Others with the same last name but unclear parentage, such as Juan Lorenzo Ramirez, were also linked to Cofresí.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Wheeler {{moved into a}} top-floor flat near Gordon Square {{with his wife and}} child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester's Roman Balkerne Gate which was published in <b>the</b> <b>Transactions</b> of the Essex Archaeological Society in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the Journal of Roman Studies; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica's revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job in the Commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, and so began to seek out alternative employment.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
50|$|A {{summary of}} a Burstcoin {{transaction}} {{is as follows}} : The sender details the parameters for <b>the</b> required <b>transaction</b> type (sending money, creating an alias, transmitting a message, issuing an asset or an order for an asset). All values for <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> inputs are bounds checked for validity. If <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> {{is found to be}} valid then the public key for the generating account is computed using the supplied secret passphrase. A new transaction is created, with a type and sub-type value set to match <b>the</b> type of <b>transaction</b> being created. All specified parameters are included in <b>the</b> <b>Transaction</b> object. A unique transaction ID is generated with the creation of <b>the</b> object. <b>The</b> <b>transaction</b> is digitally signed using the sending account's private key. <b>The</b> encrypted <b>transaction</b> data is placed within a message instructing network peers to process <b>the</b> <b>transaction.</b> <b>The</b> <b>transaction</b> is then broadcast to all peers on <b>the</b> network. Burstcoin <b>transactions</b> are based on the Nxt code base. A detailed explanation of <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> process can be found on its wiki page.|$|R
50|$|If no errors {{occurred}} during the execution of <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> then <b>the</b> system commits <b>the</b> <b>transaction.</b> A transaction commit operation applies all data manipulations {{within the scope of}} <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> and persists <b>the</b> results to the database. If an error occurs during <b>the</b> <b>transaction,</b> or if <b>the</b> user specifies a rollback operation, the data manipulations within <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> are not persisted to the database. In no case can a partial transaction be committed to the database since that would leave the database in an inconsistent state.|$|R

5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to explain}} {{completeness}} of contracts by using and extending <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> cost theory.

In addition the study extends <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> cost view by investigating the moderating effect of trust on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>transaction</b> characteristics and contractual completeness within <b>the</b> context of <b>transaction</b> cost theory. We offer a completeness scale consisting of contingency planning in hotel allotment contracts. Our results from Turkish tourism industry support <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> cost hypotheses and the moderating effect of trust on <b>the</b> relationships between <b>transaction</b> cost variables and completeness of contracts.
