Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period. <b>That</b> <b>attitude</b> was carried through {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, where in the first edition of the Oxford History of Music, Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted <b>that</b> <b>attitude</b> because party {{politics}} required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E

25|$|The Communist Party managed local {{politics}} {{in line with}} the diplomatic alignments of the Soviet Union. As a result, it supported neutrality and opposed the British influence in Argentina during {{the early stages of the}} war, {{in line with the}} Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union. The launching of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the consequent Soviet entry in the war changed <b>that</b> <b>attitude.</b> The Communists became pro-war and did not support further labour strikes against British factories located in Argentina. This switch reduced workers' support for the Communist Party, and they began to support Perón and the new government instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{support of}} the Communists proved to be {{short-lived}} in Budapest, however, and {{they had never been}} popular in country towns and countryside. In the aftermath of a coup attempt, the government took a series of actions referred to as the Red Terror, murdering several hundred people (mostly scientists and intellectuals). The Soviet Red Army was never able to aid the new Hungarian republic. Despite the great military successes against Czechoslovakian army, the Communist leaders gave back all recaptured lands. <b>That</b> <b>attitude</b> demoralized the voluntary army; the Hungarian Red Army was dissolved before it could successfully complete its campaigns. In the face of domestic backlash and an advancing Romanian force in the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919, Béla Kun and most of his comrades fled to Austria, and Budapest was occupied on 6 August. Kun and his followers took along numerous art treasures and the gold stocks of the National Bank. All these events, and in particular the final military defeat, led to a deep feeling of dislike among the general population against the Soviet Union (which did not offer military assistance) and the Hungarian Jews (since most members of Kun's government were Jewish, making it easy to blame the Jews for the government's mistakes).|$|E

500|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} (Pitohui dichrous) was {{described}} by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. Bonaparte placed it in the genus Rectes which had been erected {{in the same year}} by Ludwig Reichenbach as an alternative name for the genus Pitohui, which had been described by René Lesson in 1831. No explanation was given for the preference of the newer name over the established older one, but it was common to prefer Latin names over non-Latin names, and to provide Latin names to those without. Richard Bowdler Sharpe encapsulated <b>that</b> <b>attitude</b> when he wrote in 1903 [...] "Pitohui is doubtless an older name than Rectes, but can surely be laid aside as a barbarous word". Eventually however the principle of priority, which favours the first formal name given to a taxon, was applied, and Rectes was suppressed as the junior synonym of Pitohui.|$|E

[...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with <b>that</b> <b>attitude...</b> I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants.

30|$|In conclusion, this is {{the first}} paper {{studying}} the relationship between attitudes and sickness absence using objectively measured data on sickness absence. Previous studies have suggested <b>that</b> <b>attitudes</b> might be important for understanding variation in sickness absence. We find that there is an association between attitudes and sickness absence but mainly for self-certified sick leave. The results in our study do not support the notion <b>that</b> <b>attitudes</b> are able to explain differences in sickness absence between demographic groups.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between political participation and political attitudes {{is at the}} heart of any discussion about fostering democratic engagement. However, many authors simply presume <b>that</b> political <b>attitudes</b> reinforce political behaviour. Using a three-wave panel data set with more than 3, 000 adolescents, we show <b>that</b> political <b>attitudes</b> do not necessarily precede behaviour. On the contrary, focusing on the relationships between five political attitudes and two variants of political participation, our findings indicate that it is much more likely that political participation strengthens political <b>attitudes</b> than <b>that</b> <b>attitudes</b> trigger participation. This does not mean <b>that</b> <b>attitudes</b> are irrelevant for behaviour, but the reverse impact is much stronger. More specifically, we find that the effects of being politically engaged on political interest, efficacy, confidence and norms of citizenship are clearly stronger than the effects of these attitudes on participation...|$|R

[...] "What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather."
