While there, he discovers that Yah is also his favourite singer, who sings under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. At Gambir, he also meets with his old friend Hartono, a political activist with the political party Partindo, who enquires about Tini. On a later date, Hartono visits Tono's home and meets Tini. It is revealed that Tini was romantically involved with Hartono while {{the two of them}} were in university, where Tini surrendered her virginity to him; this action, unacceptable in traditional culture, made her disgusted with herself and unable to love. Hartono had made the situation worse by breaking off their relationship through a letter. When Hartono asks her to take him back, Tini refuses.|$|E

Returning to London, Black Coffee continued to perform in local bars, before being introduced to Ian Shaw, a noted jazz vocalist. This led eventually to the production of a debut CD, First Songs, initially credited to [...] "Gwyn and Will", of both original songs and jazz standards, which was launched at London's PizzaExpress Jazz Club in September 2003. The Herbert/Rutter song [...] "Sweet Insomnia" [...] featured guest vocals from Jamie Cullum.

500|$|The critic Bernard Bergonzi {{refers to}} Tony Last as [...] "a doomed Gothic hero", echoing Waugh's {{explanation}} {{to his friend}} Henry Yorke that {{the theme of the}} book was [...] "a Gothic man in the hands of savages—first Mrs Beaver etc, then the real ones". According to Stannard, Waugh tended <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>a</b> civilisation by its art, and especially by its architecture, and English Gothic is a major leitmotif of the novel. Tony's recognition of the extent of Brenda's betrayal is described as [...] "a whole Gothic world... come to grief". Later, Tony finds purpose in his otherwise pointless voyage when he hears of the fabled lost city from Messinger; he visualises it as Gothic in character, [...] "a transfigured Hetton... everything luminous and translucent; a coral citadel crowning a green hill top sewn with daisies". When {{at the end of his}} quest he first catches sight of Todd's settlement, in his delirium he sees, instead of the reality of mud huts and desolation, [...] "gilded cupolas and spires of alabaster".|$|E

2500|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping {{in patients}} with epilepsy has shown that critical language {{areas of the brain}} vary greatly in patients, highlighting the need to perform accurate mapping prior to surgeries in language areas.

Rather, experiments that have tested for vital language sites are variable, and the exact role of a specific cortex area in a language task is difficult <b>to</b> <b>judge.</b> <b>A</b> further complication is that many patients who have undergone language mapping have epilepsy and it is possible this causes changes in language sites. Since the procedure is so invasive, cortical stimulation mapping for language organization is not done on healthy individuals.

2500|$|In {{the first}} major {{comprehensive}} biography of the Yongzheng Emperor by Feng Erkang, the author puts the succession in perspective. Feng writes {{that there were some}} suspicious signs from the lost wills and the dates released, but the majority of evidence points to Yinzhen succeeding the throne legitimately (although with political and military maneuvering deemed necessary by the situation). Yinsi, the eighth prince, had been bribing officials for support throughout his life, and his influence penetrated the Fengtai command. Furthermore, Feng suggests that [...] "although we are not yet altogether certain on what happened with the succession, and which side is correct, it is reasonable to think that Yinzhen's political rivals manipulated all suspicion behind the will in an attempt to put a dark image on the emperor; imperial Chinese tradition had led certain schools of thought in believing that the Yongzheng Emperor's whole reign can be discredited simply because his succession of the throne did not come as a will of his father, the emperor and ultimate decision-maker in China." [...] He further suggests that the Kangxi Emperor made a grave mistake by allowing his sons to become major political players (especially since the position of crown prince was empty), and a bloody battle of succession (including a possible usurpation) was the inevitable result of imperial Chinese institutions. Therefore, it would be an even bigger mistake <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>a</b> ruler solely on the way he came to power. Certainly, the Yongzheng Emperor ensured his successor would have a smooth transition when the time came.|$|E
