5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position for the UN at <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E

25|$|Desperate union {{officials}} turned to violence {{to counter the}} setbacks they had suffered. Beginning in late 1906, national and local officials of the Iron Workers launched a dynamiting campaign.

Between 1906 and 1911, the Iron Workers blew up 110 iron works, though {{only a few thousand}} dollars in damages was done.

But Becker {{was able to bring}} the company back to <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> and win a new contract on favorable terms by using the union's enormous pension fund. The fund's trustees put pressure on Wheeling-Pitt's owners, Dewey Investors, to settle the strike. As Wheeling-Pitt's stock price fell by 50 percent and the pension fund's financial pressures increased, the owners agreed to end the strike. The union at Wheeling-Pitt emerged with a stronger contract, one which included a defined benefit pension plan.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] As UFCW {{international}} and local leaders know from first hand experience, there have been {{dramatic changes in the}} retail grocery industry over the past 15 years. Of most direct relevance to <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> environment, <b>the</b> absolute size of key corporations has increased and economic power in the industry has become more concentrated. Influenced by the spread of Wal-Mart 2 ̆ 7 s grocery operations, established companies like Kroger, Safeway, Supervalu, and Loblaw have pursued aggressive merger and market expansion strategies. Further complicating the situation has been the success of other alternative format grocers (such as Costco, Trader Joe 2 ̆ 7 s, Whole Foods, and BJ 2 ̆ 7 s), and the entry and expanding influence of global corporations. Clearly, the competitive nature of the market has been irrevocably altered. Another aspect of the change in <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> environment has been the decline in the relative strength that the UFCW brings to <b>the</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> While <b>the</b> UFCW 2 ̆ 7 s total membership numbers have marginally slipped over the past decade, the power of the key industry employers, as noted above, has vastly increased. As a result, the UFCW 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 core industry power 2 ̆ 2 in retail food has ebbed. These evolving economic realities have provided the rationale for corporate labor relations strategies that are hard-nosed, antagonistic and transcend traditional local market dynamics, which formerly were the critical factor in the character of negotiations...|$|R
40|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 embraces and {{implements}} many of {{the actions}} recommended by the President in the National Energy Strategy. Independent geothermal power producers may be direct beneficiaries of 1) further deregulation of IPPs through their exemption from {{the provisions of the}} Public Utility Holding Company Act and 2) potentially freer access to utility-owned transmission facilities. However, these doors will not be fully opened to geothermal energy until this resource can compete with other fuels in cost considerations. While changes in public policy, such as inclusion of externalities in the price of power or financial penalties on carbon dioxide emissions, will level the playing field somewhat, reductions in cost will be the ultimate marketing tool. This is particularly critical in the economics of power derived from "new," as yet undiscovered reservoirs which will reflect the high costs of today's exploration methods. The Department of Energy's geothermal R&D program, in cooperation with industry, is undertaking, as described in this paper, to achieve the technology cost reductions needed to permit this resource to enjoy a status equal to or better than that of competing fuels at <b>the</b> utility least-cost <b>bargaining</b> <b>table...</b>|$|R
40|$|The declining {{state of}} the Russian {{military}} and precarious Russian economic condition will give the US considerable advantages at <b>the</b> START III <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> Taking <b>the</b> US-RF asymmetries into account, this paper discusses a menu of START III measures the US could ask for, and measures it could offer in return, in attempting to negotiate an equitable treaty. Measures the US might seek in a START III treaty include: further reductions in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, irreversibility of reductions through warhead dismantlement; beginning to bring theater nuclear weapons under mutual control, and increased transparency into the Russian nuclear weapons complex. The US may, however, wish to apply its bargaining advantages to attempting to achieve the first steps toward two long-range goals that would enhance US security: bringing theater nuclear weapons into the US-RF arms control arena, and increasing transparency into the Russian nuclear weapons complex. In exchange for measures relating to these objectives, the US might consider offering to Russia: Further strategic weapons reductions approaching levels at which the Russians believe they could maintain a degree of parity with the US; Measures to decrease the large disparities in potential deliver-system uploading capabilities that appear likely under current START II/START III scenarios; and Financial assistance in achieving START II/START III reductions as rapidly as is technically possible...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the {{acceptance}} of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually {{has the opportunity to}} negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is able to feel more confident that they have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} Carey's {{historic}} victory at <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> in the UPS strike, {{details of the}} donations kickback scheme were unveiled by the court-appointed federal official overseeing the union's elections. The report revealed that the donations kickback scheme included Citizen Action. The report said that Carey had approved a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, and that Citizen Action had donated $75,000 of this money to the Carey re-election effort. The August 23 report also indicated that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been approached by Carey campaign officials. The report did not, however, conclude that Carey knew of the transactions and referred the matter to federal prosecutors for further investigation. Based on the report's findings, federal officials overturned the 1996 Teamsters presidential election, and called for new rules that would bar non-Teamsters from contributing to union election campaigns and establish a $1,000 contribution limit. The Independent Review Board opened its own inquiry into the financial scandal on August 27.|$|E
25|$|In early 1978, Medina was {{appointed}} the UFW's organizing director. In {{his first three}} months in office, the union won 13 elections and added more than 3,000 new members. He also changed the way the UFW approached strikes. In the past, the union would strike but end the walkout once the union had won the organizing election (held under the procedures of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act). Employers would then file numerous appeals to the election, and over the many months (and sometimes years) it took for the appeals to be heard the union's support would vanish. Medina's new strategy {{was to keep the}} workers on strike even after the organizing election was won; this pressured employers to waive their legal right to appeal, recognize the union, and enter collective bargaining neogtiations immediately. If negotiations stalled, Medina's back-up strategy was ask union members to perform their jobs sloppily and then leave work. The employer would institute a lockout, a strike would begin, and the employer would return to <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> to get the harvest in.|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{innovations}} of the 1970 s regulatory environmental {{revolution was}} the provision for citizen enforcement of regulatory standards. This innovation upset the previous bipolar regulatory model, which was a two-way negotiation between the regulated industries and the (often captive) regulatory agencies. By removing agency enforcement discretion {{as a means of}} underenforcing statutory norms, the citizens suit brought a new constituency to <b>the</b> regulatory <b>bargaining</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> citizen suit had the intended effect of implementing a regime of full enforcement of the new environmental norms. But the revolutionary effect of the newly minted citizen suit was not limited to full enforcement of environmental norms. By allowing environmental interests to bypass the agency regulatory process and proceed directly to court to enforce statutory standards, the citizen suit allowed citizens to play a primary {{role in the development of}} environmental jurisprudence, bypassing the administrative rulemaking process and resulting judicial deference to agency interpretations. In a radical shift from the classic administrative law model, where the responsible agency answered questions of first impression and review of its answers was highly deferential, the citizen suit provided nongovernmental organizations to opportunity to develop their own interpretations of the environmental norms and test these interpretations in enforcement actions in the courts as a matter of first impression. Citizen enforcers thus necessarily took on the role of citizen regulators as well, developing interpretations of statutory standards and enforcing these citizen-generated interpretations directly against violators before judges untainted by regulatory accommodations negotiated in a prior rulemaking process. This article examines the role of citizen enforcement litigation in the development of the Clean Water Act law and implementation of the Clean Water Act regulatory scheme. The essay will focus on four examples where citizen enforcement litigation under the Clean Water Act had the effect of initiating the regulatory process, drawing responses from both EPA and the Congress. These case studies will include enforcement litigation brought against underenforced Clean Water Act regulation of pesticide application, water transfers, land application of CAFO wastes, and sport shooting ranges...|$|R

25|$|After {{playing the}} first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency. In {{response}} to the strike, team owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor and Tony Dorsett crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements. On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court. In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes. He urged both sides of the conflict to return to <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> while in preparation for an anti-trust trial.|$|E
25|$|Becker {{also had}} to work to resolve an ongoing and lengthy strike in the rubber industry. The United Rubber Workers had struck the Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone tire {{manufacturer}} in July 1994. The company subsequently hired more than 6,000 workers to permanently replace the strikers. The 74,000-member Rubber Workers Union voted {{to return to work}} without a contract. Although the Rubber Workers had rejected merger with the Steelworkers and other unions in the past, now the union's leadership sought merger. The merger was agreed to just as the workers returned to work, and approved by Rubber Workers' members in July 1995. The rubber workers won immediate access to the Steelworkers' $166 million strike fund, research staff, and highly influential pension fund. Becker pushed for a comprehensive campaign strategy to be used against Bridgestone/Firestone. The Steelworkers worked with Japanese labor unions to press the company to negotiate. An innovative public campaign was used to embarrass the company at major events (including the use of a blimp at the Indianapolis 500). These tactics convinced Bridgestone/Firestone management to return to <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table,</b> and the union eventually signed contract that weakened or eliminated a number of management's demands.|$|E
25|$|SDI {{was criticized}} for {{potentially}} disrupting the strategic doctrine of mutual assured destruction. MAD postulated that intentional nuclear attack was inhibited by the certainty of ensuing mutual destruction. Even if a nuclear first strike destroyed many of the opponent's weapons, sufficient nuclear missiles would survive to render a devastating counter-strike against the attacker. The criticism was that SDI could have potentially allowed an attacker to survive the lighter counter-strike, thus encouraging a first strike by the side having SDI. Another destabilizing scenario was countries being tempted to strike first before SDI was deployed, thereby avoiding a disadvantaged nuclear posture. Proponents of SDI argued that SDI development might instead cause the side {{that did not have}} the resources to develop SDI to, rather than launching a suicidal nuclear first strike attack before the SDI system was deployed, instead come to <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> with the country that did have those resources and, hopefully, agree to a real, sincere disarmament pact that would drastically decrease all forces, both nuclear and conventional. Furthermore, the MAD argument was criticized on the grounds that MAD only covered intentional, full-scale nuclear attacks by a rational, non-suicidal opponent with similar values. It did not take into account limited launches, accidental launches, rogue launches, or launches by non-state entities or covert proxies.|$|E
40|$|Although the United States {{has not yet}} passed {{national}} legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{there have been other}} important legal developments. The federal courts have directed the government to take action regarding climate change under existing laws, and state governments have made aggressive efforts to limit emissions. The federal government has begun to plan for adapting to climate change, and it has returned to <b>the</b> international <b>bargaining</b> <b>table</b> in order to play a constructive role in climate negotiations. Although the lack of {{national legislation}} is unfortunate, the American system of separation of powers allows other legal action to be taken despite the paralysis in Congress. In comparison to Europe, the United States has been a notorious laggard in the area of climate change. The US never ratified the Kyoto Protocol. For most of the first decade of this century, the White House was occupied by George W Bush, a fervent opponent of action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Even when the White House changed hands, the situation remained frustrating because of the inability of the new administration to pass climate change legislation through Congress. Nevertheless, {{it would be a mistake}} to assume that U. S law has ignored the issue of climate change. The American constitutional system diffuses power between Congress, the executive branch, the federal courts, and state government. When one or more of those institutions fails to act, others may step in to fill the breach. That is exactly what has happened with climate change. Due to the vigorous efforts of federal courts and of many state governments, important and constructive steps have been taken to address climate change. The first part of this article discusses the activities of the federal courts concerning climate change and shows how they have pressed the federal executive branch to take action. The second part of the article discusses the role that state governments have played in creating climate policy. That section also introduces some of the constitutional issues regarding federalism that may restrict state regulation. Finally, the article discusses the evolving U. S. efforts climate change adaptation plans, and the evolving US role in international, climate negotiations, particularly in relation to China.
