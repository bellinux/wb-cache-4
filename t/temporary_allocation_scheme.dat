Chunk-based resource allocation is an effective approach to reduce the complexity of resource allocation in OFDMA systems. In this paper, a chunk-based resource <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme,</b> i. e. joint chunk, power and bit allocation, is proposed and analyzed by maximizing the throughput under a total transmit power constraint. A scaling factor is introduced to achieve optimal allocation. Considering the digital nature of bits per symbol per subcarrier (bits/symbol/subcarrier), a digitization process is proposed to digitize the theoretically allocated bits/symbol/subcarrier to integer. System parameters, such as the power constraint, number of users, coherence bandwidth, number of subcarriers and number of chunks, are introduced and their impacts on the average throughput are studied. The performance of the dynamic power <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme</b> is compared with the fixed power <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme.</b> The numerical results show that the theoretical throughput of the fixed power <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme</b> is quite close to that of the dynamic power <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, when the digital nature of bits/symbol/subcarrier is considered, the average throughput of the dynamic power allocation outperforms the fixed power <b>allocation</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new data mining {{algorithm}} which involves incremental mining for user moving patterns in a mobile computing environment and exploit the mining results to develop data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes</b> so as to improve the overall performance of a mobile system. First, we propose an algorithm to capture the frequent user moving patterns from a set of log data in a mobile environment. The algorithm proposed is enhanced with the incremental mining capability {{and is able to}} discover new moving patterns efficiently without compromising the quality of results obtained. Then, in light of mining results of user moving patterns and the properties of data objects, we develop data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes</b> that can utilize the knowledge of user moving patterns for proper allocation of both personal and shared data. By employing the data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes,</b> the occurrences of costly remote accesses can be minimized and the performance of a mobile computing system is thus improved. For personal data allocation, two data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes,</b> which explore different levels of mining results, are devised: one utilizes the set level of moving patterns and the other utilizes the path level of moving patterns. As can be seen later, the former is useful for the allocation of read-intensive data objects, whereas the latter is good for the allocation of update-intensive data objects. The data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes</b> for shared data, which are able to achieve local optimization and global optimization, are also developed. Performance of these data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes</b> is comparatively analyzed. It is shown by our simulation results that the knowledge obtained from the user moving patterns is very important in devising effective data <b>allocation</b> <b>schemes</b> which can lead to significant performance improvement in a mobile computing system.
