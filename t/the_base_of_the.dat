5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tentacles in {{some species}} lie acrorhagi, {{elongated}} inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; {{one or both}} anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Bore: The hollow {{cylinder}} bored down {{the centre of}} the cannon, including <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bore or bottom of the bore, the nearest end of the bore into which the ordnance (wadding, shot, etc.) gets packed.

5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking.

5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder {{on the surface of the}} spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E

5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope with liquid food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump {{digestive}} enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck <b>the</b> liquified tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind <b>the</b> empty husk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using <b>the</b> fangs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species <b>the</b> fangs and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|R
5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tower was}} solid stone without any rooms; {{the top of}} the {{lighthouse}} was reached using external wooden stairs, which were later replaced with iron ones.
