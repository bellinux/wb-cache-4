5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called the Grinch and his attempts to <b>thwart</b> the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other trappings of the holiday from the happy Whos of Whoville. In spite of his attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E

40|$|Drawing from {{self-determination}} theory, {{this study}} examined the interplay among PE teachers' (N = 364) self-reported perceptions of job pressure, psychological need <b>thwarting,</b> burnout, and somatic complaints. Structural equation modeling indicated that autonomy, competence, and relatedness need <b>thwarting</b> were predicted by teachers' perceptions of job pressure. In turn, the <b>thwarting</b> of each need was positively associated with burnout; the <b>thwarting</b> of the need for competence also predicted somatic complaints. Mediation analyses supported the explanatory role of need <b>thwarting.</b> The findings point to the understudied construct of need <b>thwarting</b> as a promising underlying mechanism for explaining negative health-related outcomes in teachers...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that assessments of need <b>thwarting</b> better predict diminished functioning and ill-being compared to low need satisfaction, which better predict optimal functioning and well-being. In this study we aimed to further explore the important theoretical distinction between psychological need <b>thwarting</b> and need satisfaction in the domain of interpersonal relationships. We examined whether the distinction between need satisfaction and <b>thwarting</b> is due to method effects resulting from positive and negative item wording, however, multitrait multi-method analyses indicated no substantial method effects. Further, we showed that a lack of need satisfaction (i. e., need dissatisfaction) is not equivalent to experiences of need <b>thwarting.</b> In fact, need <b>thwarting</b> better predicted compromised relational functioning compared to need dissatisfaction. Need satisfaction was a stronger predictor of interpersonal competence compared to need <b>thwarting</b> and need dissatisfaction. The current findings underline the importance of assessing need <b>thwarting</b> when examining compromised functioning in interpersonal relationships...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thwarting</b> and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in {{sentiment}} analysis, {{the former}} {{because of the}} lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of <b>thwarting</b> amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is <b>thwarted</b> or not. We focus on identifying <b>thwarting</b> in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. <b>Thwarting</b> is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of <b>thwarting</b> defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of <b>thwarting,</b> we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of <b>thwarting</b> detection, which we hope will at least provide a baseline system to compare against...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thwarted</b> {{goals and}} motivational {{obstacles}} are antecedents of aggression, {{but it is}} not entirely clear what motivates the aggressive response or why it is often displaced onto unrelated targets. The present work applies Goal Systems Theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002) to consider how displaced aggression can sometimes operate like any other means to an end. Specifically, in five studies, we find that <b>thwarted</b> goals motivate displaced aggression to compensate for a threatened sense of competence. First, when an achievement goal is experimentally <b>thwarted,</b> it both threatens self-efficacy beliefs and increases displaced aggression (Studies 1 – 2). Second, when goal-thwarted individuals have the means to engage in displaced aggression, it reestablishes self-efficacy in the <b>thwarted</b> goal domain (Study 3). However, we find that the superordinate goal being served is competence and not to be aggressive per se: In Study 4, goal <b>thwarted</b> individuals choose to help someone rather than remain idle, even if idleness is the more aggressive alternative. In Study 5, displaced aggression is attenuated among individuals who expect a second performance opportunity in the <b>thwarted</b> goal domain. Together, the results suggest goal-thwarted individuals mainly resort to displaced aggression when they lack other means to interact effectively with the environment...|$|R

40|$|When <b>thwarted</b> in a behaviour, {{laying hens}} show an {{increase}} in stereotyped pacing, displacement preening and a specific vocalisation known as the 'gakel-call'. How these behaviours, which might serve as indicators of welfare, are influenced by social factors is not yet known. In this study, we investigated the effect of an audience (another bird or a human) on {{the expression of the}} gakel-call and other behaviours indicating frustration. Twenty-four Lohman Brown hens were trained to gain free access to food in a test cage. Sixteen hens were used as test birds and eight as non-test audience birds. The food-deprived test hens were tested for 15 min in a non-thwarting situation (food freely available) and for 15 min in a <b>thwarting</b> situation (food covered but visible). For both situations we investigated four different treatments: no audience in the adjacent cage; a non-thwarted audience bird in the adjacent cage; a <b>thwarted</b> audience bird in the adjacent cage; and finally a human audience. The durations of stereotyped pacing and displacement preening were significantly higher in test birds during <b>thwarting</b> than during non-thwarting; <b>thwarted</b> birds also gave significantly more gakel-calls compared to non-thwarted birds. The test birds, and also the audience birds, gave more gakel-calls when <b>thwarted</b> {{in the presence of a}} <b>thwarted</b> conspecific than when in the presence of a non-thwarted bird, but there were no significant differences in stereotyped pacing or displacement preening, which are usually associated with frustration. In conclusion, this study supports the view that the gakel-call signals frustration in laying hens. Furthermore, the state of the audience influences the occurrence of gakel-calls in <b>thwarted</b> hens. Thus, when using the gakel-call as a welfare-indicator, the social aspects of the vocal expression of frustration in laying hens should not be overlooke...|$|R

50|$|A study {{conducted}} on suicide notes, examined the frequency in themes of <b>thwarted</b> belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in samples of suicide notes. The study of suicide notes {{has been a}} useful method for examining the motivations of suicides. It {{is important to note}} that this research is limited due to the small proportion of completed suicides that actually leave notes. This specific study explored the extent to which the content in the suicide notes reflected <b>thwarted</b> belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. They also examined the extent to which these two themes were found in the same note. What this study found was that interpersonal theory of suicide which proposes suicidal behavior is caused by perceived burdensomeness and <b>thwarted</b> belongingness combined with acquired capability, was not significantly reflective in the suicide notes. Therefore, there was no strong support for the relevance of perceived burdensomeness and <b>thwarted</b> belongingness as motivations of suicide. They did however, find that the suicide notes of women more frequently contained the theme of perceived burdensomeness and suicide notes of younger people more frequently contained <b>thwarted</b> belongingness.|$|R
