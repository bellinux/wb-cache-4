25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{implementation}} of the CDTA in accordance with KPCS, in 2012 Census reported only $462.1million worth of rough diamonds, a 28.5% decrease from the 2011 report of $646.7 million. The Census Bureau in 2012 reported that the United States received rough diamond imports from approximately 24 KP participants including Liberia, Mexico, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Israel, and Japan. Within the data reports of imports from countries such as these <b>the</b> <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> and value of the diamonds are also included. To continue to provide the most accurate data the Census compares and checks its monthly data with data it receives from USKPA to ensure that there are no discrepancies between imports and exports.|$|E
25|$|During {{the diamond}} cutting process, the diamond cutter {{wants to get}} the {{heaviest}} diamond out of a rough stone. However, this can come {{at the cost of}} lowering cut grade. If a diamond is too deep, <b>the</b> <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> will increase but result in a loss of brilliance due to light leakage. Diamond cutters have to contend with working a stone to its best finished form with the least amount of waste. This strategy depends {{on the quality of the}} stone and its final proportions. If two diamonds of equal weight are inspected there can be a noticeable difference in size when viewed from above; arguably the most important view. A well cut 0.90ct diamond for example could have the same width as a poorly cut 1.00ct diamond. This phenomenon is known as spread.|$|E
50|$|Collectors {{look for}} depth of color, {{possibly}} with red flashes if cut conventionally. As amethyst {{is readily available}} in large structures {{the value of the}} gem is not primarily defined by carat weight; this is different to most gemstones where <b>the</b> <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> exponentially increases the value of the stone. The biggest factor in the value of amethyst is the color displayed.|$|E
5|$|For the {{coronation}} of her husband, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore Queen Victoria's collet necklace {{along with a}} much larger one. <b>The</b> necklace's <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> has never been disclosed, {{but it is clear}} from photos that it contains approximately 45 large diamond collets.|$|R
50|$|Since red {{diamonds}} {{are classified}} as diamonds in every sense, they are also graded by the typical four Cs of Connoisseurship: Color, Clarity, Cut and <b>Carat</b> <b>weight.</b> Like with all fancy color diamonds, the Color attribute is considered the absolute most important characteristic of the diamond and is largely what determines its value. The next most important attribute is <b>the</b> diamond’s <b>carat</b> <b>weight,</b> followed by its clarity, and cut.|$|R
50|$|The square princess cut diamond {{is usually}} {{slightly}} cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds of <b>the</b> same <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> because it retains about 80% {{of the rough}} diamond, {{as opposed to the}} round brilliant which retains only about 50% of the rough. The ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> {{measures}} {{the mass of}} a diamond. One carat is defined as 200 milligrams (about 0.007 ounces avoirdupois). The point unit—equal to one one-hundredth of a carat (0.01 carat, or 2 mg)—is commonly used for diamonds of less than one carat. All else being equal, the price per carat increases with carat weight, since larger diamonds are both rarer and more desirable for use as gemstones.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{scaffolding}} {{was constructed}} around the statue in the museum's Great Stair Hall for a year-long restoration. Conservators carefully cleaned its copper surface with chemicals and steam, removing {{nearly a century}} of dirt and grime. Samples of the small patches of remaining gold leaf on the statue were taken {{in an effort to}} match <b>the</b> <b>carat,</b> <b>weight</b> and color with its replacement. The statue's surface was then repaired and regilded with 180 square feet of gold leaf. Because it was known from contemporary sources that Saint-Gaudens did not like the look of bright gold at eye level, the conservators matted the gilding to reduce the glare and museum lighting designers adjusted the display lights for the interior display.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} diamond cut is often {{decided by the}} {{original}} shape of the rough stone, location of internal flaws or inclusions, <b>the</b> preservation of <b>carat</b> <b>weight,</b> and popularity of certain shapes among consumers.

5000|$|Annual {{report by}} all KPCS members is a {{component}} of peer review mechanism established by KPCS. In the United States, for example, all companies that buy, sell, and ship rough diamonds must submit an annual report via email to the State Department, deadline April 1. [...] The report must include the company's contact information and a detailed breakdown of <b>the</b> total <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> and value in U.S. dollars of rough diamonds imported, exported, and stockpiled (still in inventory) for the previous calendar year. These are also sorted by HTS codes for unsorted (gem and industrial) rough diamonds, sorted rough industrial diamonds, and sorted rough gem diamonds—the latter of which {{is most likely to}} be polished into finished stones and jewelry for retail sale, while industrial diamonds {{are most likely to be}} used in cutting and drilling tools. Failure to submit this annual report in a timely fashion could result in a fine up to $10,000. If found to be in willful violation, the convicted offender could be fined up to $50,000 and sentenced to jail time up to ten years.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{price per}} <b>carat</b> does not {{increase}} linearly with increasing size. Instead, there are sharp jumps around milestone <b>carat</b> <b>weights,</b> as demand {{is much higher}} for diamonds weighing just more than a milestone than for those weighing just less. As an example, a 0.99-carat diamond may have a significantly lower price per carat than a comparable 1.01-carat diamond, because of differences in demand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the selling price of diamonds and their weight in carats. For this purpose, we use a unique sample of 112, 080 certified diamonds collected from www. info-diamond. com {{during the first week of}} July 2011. We find substantial differences in pricing depending on cut shape. The price of diamonds increases markedly with <b>the</b> <b>carat</b> <b>weight,</b> with a price elasticity equal to 1. 94. However, estimates from unconditional quantile regressions show that the price-weight elasticity is not constant since it rises along the price distribution of diamonds. Finally, we observe the existence of significant increases in prices for diamonds featured with round weights compared to gems just below these threshold weights...|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{because of}} the {{relative}} importance of <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> among buyers, many diamonds are often intentionally cut poorly to increase <b>carat</b> <b>weight.</b> There is a financial premium for a diamond that weighs <b>the</b> desirable 1.0 <b>carat</b> mg, so often the girdle is made thicker or the depth is increased. Neither of these changes makes the diamond appear any larger, and both greatly reduce the sparkle of the diamond. (A poorly cut 1.0 carat mg diamond may have the same diameter and appear as large as a 0.85 <b>carat</b> mg diamond.) <b>The</b> depth percentage is the overall quickest indication {{of the quality of the}} cut of a round brilliant. [...] "Ideal" [...] round brilliant diamonds should not have a depth percentage greater than 62.5%. Another quick indication is the overall diameter. Typically a round brilliant 1.0 carat mg diamond should have a diameter of about 6.5 mm. Mathematically, the diameter in millimeters of a round brilliant should approximately equal to 6.5 times the cube root of <b>carat</b> <b>weight,</b> or 11.1 times the cube root of gram weight, or 1.4 times the cube root of point weight.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} a market for {{recycled}} diamonds from companies and industry, WP Diamonds focuses {{the majority of its}} operations on buying from the public often with old or unwanted diamond rings. Diamonds that are recycled using this method traditionally go through a number of steps. Diamond buying companies often use a 4-step process buying diamonds from a member of the public. Initially, a valuation of the diamond will take place over the telephone or via email. People can expect to receive 20%-65% of what they paid originally, depending upon where and when they acquired the piece. During this step, <b>the</b> <b>Weight</b> (<b>carat),</b> Condition, Shape, Clarity, Color, Fluorescence, and Cut Grade will be evaluated. Also included in this step is the price for the additional materials with the diamond, such as gold or platinum, if it is a ring.|$|R

40|$|The {{seeds of}} various plants {{were used as}} weights because their mass reputedly varies so little. Carob (Ceratonia siliqua), which has given its name to <b>the</b> <b>carat,</b> is {{particularly}} famous in this regard. But are carob seeds unusually constant in weight and, if not, how did the myth arise? The variability of seeds sampled from a collection of carob trees (CV= 23 %) {{was close to the}} average of 63 species reviewed from the literature (CV= 25 %). However, in a perception experiment observers could discriminate differences in carob seed weight of around 5 % by eye demonstrating the potential for humans to greatly reduce natural variation. Interestingly, the variability of pre-metrication <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> standards is also around 5 % suggesting that human rather than natural selection gave rise to the carob myth...|$|R
50|$|Red {{diamonds}} {{are famous}} for their generally small <b>carat</b> sizes. <b>The</b> majority of red diamonds on the market are less than 1 <b>carat</b> in <b>weight.</b> Only 5 red diamonds are known {{to exist in the}} world that are greater than 5 <b>carats</b> in <b>weight,</b> and <b>the</b> largest is only 5.11 carats. Only a handful of red diamonds are discovered on an annual basis throughout the world, and most of them do not exceed 1 carat. Red diamonds are priced per carat as all diamonds are, and their per carat price is 300-400% higher than <b>the</b> per <b>carat</b> prices of <b>the</b> next most expensive diamonds, pink diamonds and blue diamonds.|$|R

50|$|The GIA Laboratory {{provides}} {{a variety of}} gem grading and identification reports. Diamond grading reports for unmounted natural and synthetic diamonds determine their key characteristics: color, clarity, cut and <b>carat</b> <b>weight.</b> GIA issues two types of reports, the more complete being the Diamond Grading Report (a briefer and less expensive version is called a Diamond Dossier). The reports contain a number of measurements, including of <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> {{as well as a}} diagram of where and what types of inclusions are located in the diamond. Diamond grading reports are now demanded by most consumers purchasing diamonds over a certain size, typically for over 0.5 carat (100 mg), and almost always for over 1.0 carat (200 mg), and are considered an important tool in guaranteeing that a diamond is accurately represented to a potential buyer.|$|R

50|$|Though the Discus and <b>the</b> <b>Carat</b> share wings, they {{position}} them differently: the Discus is a mid-wing aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>Carat</b> a low-wing one. Like <b>the</b> Discus, <b>the</b> <b>Carat</b> {{has a high}} T-tail {{with separate}} tailplane and elevators. The tailplane, like the wings, is detachable for easy transport.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{non-profit}} gemological associations which grade and provide reports, (informally referred to by the term certificate or cert, which is a misnomer for many grading reports) on diamonds; while <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> and cut angles are mathematically defined, the clarity and color are judged by the trained human eye and are therefore open to slight variance in interpretation. These associations are listed below.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} a diamond's cut is widely {{considered}} {{the most important of}} the four Cs in determining the beauty of a diamond; indeed, it is commonly acknowledged that a well-cut diamond can appear to be of greater <b>carat</b> <b>weight,</b> and have clarity and color appear to be of better grade than they actually are. The skill with which a diamond is cut determines its ability to reflect and refract light.|$|R
50|$|Celestial Star {{items are}} always {{changing}} as styles that sell are replenished, older styles are discontinued, and popular new styles are rolled out. The current styles, especially in diamond pendants and earrings, are priced {{lower than those}} of years past and have a lower total <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> of diamonds. New styles focus more on clusters or multiple diamonds instead of solitaire diamonds, which allows for a lower price.|$|R
50|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight, about 50%. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry {{in order to avoid}} inclusions or to preserve the weight. Since the per-carat price of a diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat (200 mg) diamonds are the result of compromising Cut quality for <b>Carat</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Total <b>carat</b> <b>weight</b> (t.c.w.) is {{a phrase}} used to {{describe}} the total mass of diamonds or other gemstone in a piece of jewelry, when more than one gemstone is used. Diamond solitaire earrings, for example, are usually quoted in t.c.w. when placed for sale, indicating the mass of the diamonds in both earrings and not each individual diamond. T.c.w. is also widely used for diamond necklaces, bracelets and other similar jewelry pieces.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Detail of <b>the</b> <b>Carat's</b> {{propeller}} with <b>the</b> {{engine off}} ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Carat</b> {{is powered}} by an air-cooled, four cylinder, Volkswagen derived, 40 kW (54 hp) Sauer S1800 piston engine. This drives the unique feature of <b>the</b> <b>Carat,</b> its folding two blade propeller: the blades fold forward like spears to {{minimize}} drag when the engine is off. This {{is in contrast to}} other motorgliders which mostly either store the propeller inside the fuselage, or merely feather the propeller blades. <b>The</b> <b>Carat's</b> propeller is opened by the centrifugal force on the turning blades, working against a folding force provided by a gas damping spring mechanism. [...] This folding mechanism has the advantage of simplicity, but it means that the engine can not be windmill-started if the battery is flat. Because of the forward pointing blades when the engine is off, <b>the</b> <b>Carat</b> cannot be towed aloft like traditional sailplanes.|$|R

50|$|A {{big part}} of the AGS {{operation}} {{comes in the form of}} AGS Laboratories, which offers laboratory services to members of the jewelry industry. Primary among these are their diamond grading services.
