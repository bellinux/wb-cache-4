5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 97 on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending February 16, 1974, and by February 26, had already sold 500,000 copies and was {{certified}} Gold. The following week it rose to number 39, and on March 16 of the same year, it reached the top position. It became Streisand's second number one and seventh top five album, with the other number-one being People (1964). <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were spent two weeks at the highest position before falling to number four on March 30. It continued dropping on the charts but managed {{to stay within the}} top 10 of the list for a total of six weeks. The Recording Industry Association of America changed its certification status to Platinum for shipments upwards of 1,000,000 sales, and again on September 23, 1998, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were was certified for selling over 2,000,000 copies.

5|$|ButterFly is {{the sixteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on October 1, 1974 by Columbia Records. After releasing <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were earlier in 1974, a collection predominantly consisting of previously released songs, Streisand recorded her first album of entirely new material in over three years. Recorded throughout 1974 and primarily a contemporary pop record, it also incorporates music from the reggae and R genres. All of the tracks on ButterFly are cover songs produced by Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters, originating from artists like Bob Marley, David Bowie, Evie Sands, and Graham Nash.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

5|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Streisand's vocals {{and found the}} record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were topped the Billboard 200 in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
