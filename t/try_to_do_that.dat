500|$|In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several {{songs from}} Made in the Dark, {{with one of}} their [...] "all-time heroes", Robert Wyatt. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{co-pilot}} {{who lost}} her family in a Kaiju attack. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in my life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to her critics, Brigitte Gabriel has said that [...] "I am not anti-Muslim, I am anti ideologies which want to kill free people and subjugate them right now, {{in the name of}} the Islamic religion. I would fight with the same passion if crazy Christians were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> if crazy Jews were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> or whatever crazy religious is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I am for the human spirit and for the individuality of the human spirit." [...] She argued that there are innocent Muslims who have not even read the Quran.|$|R

2500|$|Jay Leno led the April 16 {{show off}} by sending prayers and best wishes to {{everyone}} affected. [...] He stated that {{his job was}} to end the day on a happy note, and be a little silly, {{and he was going to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for everyone on that day.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in [...] (2000, p.11), Stephen King writes: [...] "There {{is little or}} no {{detectable}} bullshit in that book. (Of course, it's short; at eighty-five pages it's much shorter than this one.) I'll tell you right now that every aspiring writer should read The Elements of Style. Rule 17 in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is [...] "Omit needless words." [...] I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} all along has been the {{automatic}} assumption {{on the part of}} many that Rowling has the right to completely control anything written about the Harry Potter world. That's quite a huge power grab on her part and from everything I can tell, not legal. You and I are part of a subculture that lives off the creative work of others. We always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in a legal and respectful way. However, if Rowling manages to extend her reach that far into our subculture, she will choke us off very quickly. And if she doesn't, what's to stop the next person from taking this legal precedent to even more dangerous places? ...|$|E

2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ralph!" [...] {{suddenly}} cried Mrs. Cliff, [...] "don't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The thing may break under you, {{and nobody}} knows what you would fall into. Come down." ...|$|E

5000|$|She later said, [...] "I {{guess if}} I'd had any sense, I'd {{have been a}} little scared — but {{what was the point of}} being scared?

[...] "I need a secretary, {{and in that}} {{position}} Tom Gates will quickly {{be able to live}} down this unfortunate affair. And if he turns out as well as I expect, he will soon be able to marry Lucy and give her a comfortable home. So now nothing remains but to find your girl, and we'll <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I assure you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--why should I try? If any trying were necessary, I {{would try}} rather not to love you. Why should I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which would displease {{everybody}} belonging to me? For yourself, I admit {{your right to}} address me,--and tell you frankly {{that it would not}} be in vain, if I loved you. But I tell you as frankly that such a marriage would not please those whom I am bound to try to please." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Daughter of the House {{smiled a}} little. [...] "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But he is entirely independent; {{he is under}} nobody; and that suited Almia.

5000|$|... "The {{diversity}} of the world cannot be overcome in a political system; whoever <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> only produced tyranny and misery.

6000|$|... "For once I {{agree with}} you thoroughly, Hallett. It is bad enough to march in West Africa, but it is worse to sit still. It is only when you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> that you find how much you are pulled down; and the longer you sit still, the less {{disposed}} you are to get up; whereas, on the march, you are so full {{of the idea that}} you may be ambushed, at any moment, that you have no time to think of your fatigues." ...|$|E
60|$|How soberly, simply, modestly, {{they tell}} this strange story. How {{differently}} {{they might have}} told it. A man might write whole poems, whole books of philosophy, about that transfiguration, and yet never reach the full depth of its beauty and of its meaning. But the evangelists do not even <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> As with the crucifixion, as with all the most wonderful passages of our Lord's life, they simply say what happened, and let the story bring its own message home to our hearts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be prudent and starve? Do ye {{call that}} war? I tell you this, {{if you do}} not already know it: The new {{circumstances}} have changed the face of matters. The true point of attack has shifted; it {{is on the other side}} of the river now. One must take the fortifications that command the bridge. The English know that if we are not fools and cowards we will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> They are grateful for your piety in wasting this day. They will reinforce the bridge forts from this side to-night, knowing what ought to happen to-morrow. You have but lost a day and made our task harder, for we will cross and take the bridge forts. Bastard, tell me the truthdoes not this council know that there is no other course for us than the one I am speaking of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Many philanthropists have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and signally failed.

However, we should each do our humble part toward the moral uplift of our fellows and one way is not to condone what we know to be wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|Her manner was defiant, {{her tone}} was positive; I doubted both. Under the surface of her assumed confidence, I saw {{something}} which {{told me that she}} was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> read my thoughts in my face.

60|$|They <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{and thrust}} their lances and swords into the straw body, but without doing any damage except to make {{holes in the}} Scarecrow's clothes.

60|$|In the Psalms and {{elsewhere}} {{we are always}} reading of the righteous and the unrighteous until those terms grow wearisome. It is only of late years that I have discovered, or think that I have discovered, what they mean. Our lives cannot be judged by our deeds; they must be judged by our desires or rather by our moral attitude. It {{is not what we}} do so much as what we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> counts in the formation of character. All fall short, all fail, but in the end those who seek to climb out of the pit, those who strive, however vainly, to fashion failure to success, are, by comparison, the righteous, while those who are content to wallow in our native mire and to glut themselves with the daily bread of vice, are the unrighteous. To turn our backs thereon wilfully and without cause, is the real unforgiveable sin against the Spirit. At least that is the best definition of the problem at which I in my simplicity can arrive.|$|E
60|$|But {{does that}} make {{religion}} needless? Does that make prayer useless? How so? The seaman may say, I dare not pray that the storm may not come. But there is no necessity that I should be found in its path. And I may pray, and I will pray, that God may so guide and govern my voyage, and all its little accidents, that I may pass it by. I know that I can forecast the storm somewhat; and if I do not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I am tempting God: but I may pray, I will pray, that my forecast may be correct. I will pray the Spirit of God, who gives man understanding, {{to give me a}} right judgment, a sound mind, and a calm heart, that I may make no mistake and neglect no precaution; and if I fail, and sink--God's will be done. It is a good will to me and all my crew; and {{into the hands of the}} good God who has redeemed me, I commend my spirit, and their spirits likewise.|$|E
6000|$|Devout-under-difficulties {{would have}} been the name of Lang Tammas had he been of Covenanting times. So I thought one wintry afternoon, years before I went to the schoolhouse, when he dropped in to ask the {{pleasure}} of my company to the farmer of Little Rathie's [...] "bural." [...] As a good Auld Licht, Tammas reserved his swallow-tail coat and [...] "lum hat" [...] (chimney pot) for the kirk and funerals; but the coat would have flapped villainously, to Tammas's eternal ignominy, had he for one rash moment relaxed his hold on the bottom button, and it was only by walking sideways, as horses sometimes <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> the hat could be kept at the angle of decorum. Let it not be thought that Tammas had asked me to Little Rathie's funeral on his own responsibility. Burals were among the few events to break the monotony of an Auld Licht winter, and invitations were as much sought after as cards to my lady's dances in the south. This had been a fair average season for Tammas, though of his four burials one had been a bairn's--a mere bagatelle; but {{had it not been for}} the death of Little Rathie I would probably not have been out that year at all.|$|E
