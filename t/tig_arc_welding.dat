The η phase formed at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) exhibited a similar size to that of WC particles and its formation was mainly attributed to the inter diffusion among W, C and Fe, Co, Ni in solid-state γ phase. The large-size η phase near the interface between YG 30 and weld bead {{was due to the}} coarsening of tiny η grains in the liquid weld bead. The small-size η phase was formed via precipitation from the γ phase during cooling.

40|$|An {{approach}} to reduce manufacturing cost, weight, design and improve {{quality of a}} component is {{through the use of}} tailor welded blanks (TWBs). TWBs are welded blanks that consist of similar or dissimilar material, thicknesses, and surface properties before forming process. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the strength and fatigue behavior of the TWBs with different thickness combination and loading direction. The welding process was done by tungsten inert gas (<b>TIG)</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> This study is divided into three parts. First, tensile tests were carried out. It was found that combinations were affected by the difference in thickness (2 mm/ 3 mm) and weld orientation (45 o and 90 o towards loading direction).

In addition, weld loading direction played a dominant role when the thickness difference was large. The second part investigates the effect of welding joint on the fatigue strength of the TWBs combination. The experimental results show that the failure occurs at welding zone as the specimens were subjected to fatigue and impact loading. In the last part of this thesis, the examination of the weld quality was carried out. Through the microstructure constituents in the weld, the strength and effects on the TWBs were discusse...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Non-contact ignition of <b>TIG</b> <b>welding</b> <b>arcs</b> has been studied. The variation of dc voltage with dc current of combined acdc discharges indicated that an ac-dominated discharge, a dc-dominated discharge and a transition region exist during the initial current rise after breakdown from cold. These measurements enabled the conditions for reliable ignition of dc arcs using a continuous sinusoidal hf source to be predicted. The minimum current to sustain a cold arc and the time taken to reach the steady-state were investigated using a novel capacitor discharge supply. The results showed that to initiate a 3 mm <b>TIG</b> <b>welding</b> <b>arc</b> from cold supplied by a power supply with an open circuit voltage of 80 V, a minimum current of about 0. 9 A may be required and the time taken for the arc to reach the steady-state may take several hundred milliseconds. The results of investigations on combined ac-dc discharges, minimum current to sustain a cold arc and the time taken to reach the steady-state indicated that for safe, interference-free and reliable non-contact arc ignition, a continuous sinusoidal hf supply was the best method. A high voltage (about 3 kV) and high current (about 1 A) were required simultaneously to initiate a 3 mm <b>TIG</b> <b>arc</b> from cold.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{the demand for}} natural gas has {{steadily}} increased {{for the prevention of}} environmental pollution. For this reason, many liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers have been manufactured. Since {{one of the most important}} issues in the design of LNG carriers is to guarantee structural safety, the use of low-temperature materials is increasing. Among commonly employed low-temperature materials, nickel steel has many benefits such as good strength and outstanding corrosion resistance. Accordingly, nickel steels are one of the most commonly used low-temperature steels for LNG storage tanks. However, the study of fracture toughness with various welding consumables of 7 % nickel alloy steel is insufficient for ensuring the structural safety of LNG storage tanks. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate fracture toughness of several different weldments for 7 % nickel alloy steels.

Although the annual intake of 232 Th estimated using these values did not exceed the annual limit intake (ALI, 1. 6 × 102 Bq), we recommend reducing 232 Th exposure by substituting thoriated electrodes with a thorium-free electrodes, setting up local ventilation systems, and by using respiratory protective equipment.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to assess the thermal efficiency of welding shielding gases {{by means of the}} arc temperature field analysis. Since this approach opens a remarkable study field to assess different shielding gases, giving support for dealing with advantages and disadvantages of commercial gas mixtures, there is a research line under development, which goal is to find techniques to measure arc temperatures. This work describes a proposed method containing different procedures to quantify plasma jet temperature profiles from experimental data. This method was applied on data taken from <b>TIG</b> <b>welding</b> <b>arc,</b> at low current (40 A). This low current was selected to contrast to and amplify the current literature focus, i. e., high currents. The experiment was conducted using emission spectroscopy, picking punctual luminescence from the plasma through an optic system. The <b>TIG</b> <b>arc</b> was stroked on a water-cooled copper plate and shielded by pure argon. The temperature field was determined through the modified Fowler-Milne method. The introduced modification aimed to overcome the limitation that this method has for low radiation intensity presents in low current arcs: the Fowler-Milne method has an intrinsic threshold of 10, 000 - 25, 000 K. For a 40 -A arc, the lower 10, 000 -K limiting isotherm is reached close to the cathode, restricting the analysis field, especially for the anode region. The proposed modification suggests a linear distribution of the particle density instead of a Maxwellian one, at temperatures below 12, 500 K. The experimental temperature field was compared to a previous publication that deals with numerical simulation and the results were found in good agreement, what indicates the supposition of a linear distribution it is not far from the reality...|$|R
