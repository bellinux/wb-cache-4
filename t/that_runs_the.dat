5|$|After the Man and His World summer {{exhibitions}} were discontinued, {{with most}} pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island {{was incorporated into}} a municipal park run {{by the city of}} Montreal. In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> park also changed its name from the Société du parc des Îles to the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton from its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. Also, the France and Quebec pavilions now form the Montreal Casino. La Toundra Hall is part of the surviving structural remains of the Canadian pavilion. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as the administration building of Parc Jean-Drapeau (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and {{much of the rest of}} the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s).|$|E

5|$|The large groove <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> {{length of}} the spine was {{once thought to be}} a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E
5|$|Two of the lines, 400 and 500, are {{designated}} as providing inner services. These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker, along the Trunk Line to Lillestrøm and the Østfold Line to Ski, stopping at all stations. The six other line, {{which make up}} the outer services, only make occasional stops on these sections. The inner services operate with a normal headway of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour. In late evening {{and parts of the}} weekend, this is further reduced to 60 minutes. NSB's outer routes operate with a normal headway of 60 minutes, with rush-hour services offered at 30-minute intervals and late evening service provided every 120 minutes. Services between Årnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services, and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services. The Gjøvik Line runs with a 40-minute headway, with three different stopping patterns. One calls at all stations until Hakadal, one calls at most stations until Jaren, while one is an express service <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> line's full length to Gjøvik.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{significant}} revenue stream of rents, museum admissions, and event fees, the Newseum loses {{significant amounts of}} money. In 2015, the museum lost more than $2.5 million on revenue of $59 million.

25|$|North of El Salvador, Mexico {{and most}} of Guatemala are riding on the westward-moving North American Plate that butts against the {{northern}} edge of the stationary Caribbean Plate in southern Guatemala. The grinding action of these two plates creates a fault (similar to the San Andreas fault in California) <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> length of the valley of the Rio Motagua in Guatemala. Motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in northernmost El Salvador.|$|E

25|$|In the Unix model, the {{operating}} system consists of two parts; first, the huge collection of utility programs that drive most operations, the other the kernel <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> programs. Under Unix, from a programming standpoint, {{the distinction between the}} two is fairly thin; the kernel is a program, running in supervisor mode, that acts as a program loader and supervisor for the small utility programs making {{up the rest of the}} system, and to provide locking and I/O services for these programs; beyond that, the kernel didn't intervene at all in user space.|$|E
25|$|A BWR {{is like a}} PWR {{without the}} steam generator. A boiling water reactor is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower {{pressure}}, which allows the water to boil inside the pressure vessel producing the steam <b>that</b> <b>runs</b> <b>the</b> turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, {{and they can be}} simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.|$|E

Much of the beach in Edgartown is open to the public with ample parking available. The section of the beach near Katama is often crowded, while the sections further to the west (near Edgartown Great Pond and Oyster Pond) are often less so.|$|E
