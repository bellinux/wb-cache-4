To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear to be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} hepatitis B {{turned out to be}} false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.|$|E

25|$|The Giants' {{front office}} {{operations}} were complicated by a long-standing feud between Wellington Mara and his nephew, Tim Mara. Jack Mara {{had died in}} 1965, leaving {{his share of the}} club to his son Tim. Wellington and Tim's personal styles and their visions for the club clashed, and eventually they stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. Commissioner Rozelle intervened and appointed a neutral general manager, George Young, allowing the club to operate more smoothly. The feud became moot on February 20, 1991, when Tim Mara sold his shares in the club to Preston Robert Tisch.|$|E

Hadlee's {{outstanding}} personal {{performance in the}} second test at Nottingham (his county 'home') where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand's first innings powered his team to victory. In this test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with a nasty bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement {{in the dressing room}} prior to the game.

500|$|Longtime Floyd {{collaborator}} Storm Thorgerson {{provided the}} album artwork. He erected two large metal heads, each {{the height of}} a double-decker bus, in a field near Ely. The sculptures were positioned close together, and photographed in profile, to give the illusion that not only were they either facing or <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, they also presented the viewer with a third face. Thorgerson mentioned the [...] "third absent face" [...] was a reference to Syd Barrett. The sculptures were devised by Keith Breeden, and constructed by John Robertson. Ely Cathedral is visible on the horizon. The pictures were shot in cold February for optimal lighting conditions. [...] Since 2001, the sculptures are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. An alternate version of the cover photo, featuring two [...] stone sculptures by Aden Hynes, was featured on the compact cassette release and the tour brochure.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E

500|$|In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's eponymous tenth {{album was}} {{released}} to great commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the U.S. in 1976. The record's biggest hit single, [...] "Rhiannon", gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboard player and vocalist Christine McVie, bass guitarist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After {{six months of}} non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending eight years of marriage. The couple stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac, after guitarist Bob Welch had left—were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, {{had an affair with}} his best friend.|$|E
500|$|Karen is {{voiced by}} American actress Jill Talley, {{who is also}} the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over {{electronic}} sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound. Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as [...] "deadpan" [...] by the Associated Press. Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [...] start to actually overlap so much <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other that [...] have to tell us, 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'" [...] Lawrence also feels that voicing the characters for so long has built a close relationship between the two actors. On the topic, he said, [...] "This on-TV marriage we have, the whole world knows us being married... We start becoming a married couple [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{elements}} [...] {{are found}} in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period, [...] such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason, [...] Mason calls the people in the emaki [...] "house bound". The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left; [...] or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left. Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the onna-e genre of yamato-e and is in this respect similar to the Tale of Genji Scrolls (1120–1140) but differs from them in many other aspects. Typical for onna-e, the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added. Illustrations are relatively short compared to emaki of war or folktales, which according to Mason, [...] "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".|$|E

500|$|After Fox {{dropped the}} film in early 2000 and before USA Films {{expressed}} interest soon after, Soderbergh paid for pre-production with his own money. USA Films agreed to give him final cut on Traffic and also agreed to his term that all the Mexican characters would speak Spanish while <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other. This meant {{that almost all of}} Benicio del Toro's dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in both English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and del Toro rejected the suggestion. Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers, [...] "Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, 'No way. Over my dead body.' Steven was like, 'Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.'" [...] The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the [...] "impenetrability of another culture".|$|E
500|$|Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg {{previously}} on Rocko's Modern Life. When {{working on}} the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to audition {{for all of the}} characters. Since other voices had been found for the main cast already, Lawrence started out by voicing a variety of minor characters. This included Plankton, who was initially only set to appear in one episode. Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon executives told Hillenburg, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's Doug , don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'" [...] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton. Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound whenever she speaks. Talley and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue. Lawrence called improvisation his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth.

500|$|Setting {{the finale}} in several {{different}} time periods was criticized by some critics. Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "we endure a swirl of confusing, unnecessary sequences, from Grace's dream to current reality to two years later to their kids' first day of college to their kids' impending wedding. By the end, instead of being sad to bid adieu, we're just relieved not to have yet another disbelief-suspending flash-forward thrust upon us." [...] Jim Schembri of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "The time-jumping device is overused and a tad awkward but, by and large, it’s a noble finale {{to one of the}} better standard three-wall sitcoms from America." [...] Amy Amatangelo of Zap2it commented that Will & Grace [...] "is a show that spent eight seasons predicated on the lasting friendship of Will and Grace, and we're supposed to believe that they spent over 20 years not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other just because their lives went in different directions? That there is no way their friendship could have been sustained once they both found the love of their life?" [...] Amatangelo enjoyed Jack and Karen's performance of [...] "Unforgettable", {{but the rest of the}} finale she [...] "could have done without." ...|$|E
