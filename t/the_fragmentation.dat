5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from <b>the</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> jet <b>fragmentation</b> {{function}} describes <b>the</b> longitudinal momentum {{distribution of}} hadrons inside a reconstructed jet. We study <b>the</b> jet <b>fragmentation</b> function in proton-proton collisions {{in the framework}} of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We find that, up to power corrections, <b>the</b> jet <b>fragmentation</b> function can be expressed as the ratio of the fragmenting jet function and the unmeasured jet function. Using renormalization group techniques, we are able to resum large logarithms of jet radii R in the perturbative expansion of the cross section. We use our theoretical formalism to describe <b>the</b> jet <b>fragmentation</b> functions for light hadron and heavy meson production measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our calculations agree very well with the experimental data for the light hadron production. On the other hand, although our calculations for the heavy meson production inside jets are consistent with the PYTHIA simulation, they fail to describe the LHC data. We find that <b>the</b> jet <b>fragmentation</b> function for heavy meson production is very sensitive to <b>the</b> gluon-to-heavy-meson <b>fragmentation</b> function.

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling <b>the</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of the projectile.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus {{is known}} to have 13 inner moons. Their orbits lie inside that of Miranda.

The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab is a source of Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; <b>the</b> <b>fragmentation</b> grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. <b>The</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E

5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from <b>the</b> <b>fragmentation</b> of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

40|$|We derive gluon <b>fragmentation</b> {{functions}} in <b>the</b> Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model by treating a gluon {{as a pair}} of color lines formed by fictitious quark and anti-quark (qq̅). Gluon elementary fragmentation functions are obtained from the quark and anti-quark elementary fragmentation functions for emitting specific mesons in the NJL model under the requirement that the qq̅ pair maintains in the flavor-singlet state after meson emissions. An integral equation, which iterates <b>the</b> gluon elementary <b>fragmentation</b> functions to all orders, is then solved to yield <b>the</b> gluon <b>fragmentation</b> functions at a model scale. It is observed that these solutions are stable with respect to variation of relevant model parameters, especially after QCD evolution to a higher scale is implemented. We show that the inclusion of <b>the</b> gluon <b>fragmentation</b> {{functions in}}to <b>the</b> theoretical predictions from only <b>the</b> quark <b>fragmentation</b> functions greatly improves the agreement with the SLD data for the pion and kaon productions in e^+e^- annihilation.
