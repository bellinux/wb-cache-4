5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms <b>that</b> <b>last</b> a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 30, the third lowest value {{at the time}} and the lowest since 1864.

It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph (63km/h), which is tropical storm strength.|$|E

5|$|After Brantinghame Hall closed, {{he again}} played Chrysos in {{a revival of}} Pygmalion and Galatea at the Lyceum Theatre and played Mr Barnes in his own play, To the Death, at the Olympic Theatre. He then {{appeared}} at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey in Pickwick (1889), a successful one-act musical play by F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon based on an episode in The Pickwick Papers, which Barrington ended up directing and in which he alternated in the roles of Pickwick and Baker. Barrington then created the role of Lt. Col. Cadbury in a Grundy farce called Merry Margate and next played Tosser in a comic opera by Solomon and George P. Hawtrey called Penelope, in which he co-starred with Dan Leno. He also played {{a number of other}} roles in other theatres throughout 1889 until he rejoined D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Giuseppe in The Gondoliers in December 1889, remaining for the long run of <b>that</b> <b>last</b> Gilbert and Sullivan hit.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team <b>that</b> <b>last</b> held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, {{he found himself}} in the rare position of being a sought-after free agent at the major league level during the era of the reserve clause, and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in <b>that</b> <b>last</b> mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the Blue Water Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. <b>That</b> <b>last</b> segment of US25 to be paved was completed near Port Hope {{at the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E
