However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Finless {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after <b>their</b> <b>birth,</b> but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E

Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates {{during the first half}} of season nine.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|The region {{governed by}} the Celestial Masters was divided into 24 regions for both {{administrative}} and religious reasons. Each of these 24 regions were connected {{with one of the}} Five Phases, one of the 24 periods of the year and with one of the 28 constellations of the zodiac. Depending on <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> signs, each adherent belonged to one of these districts. Each of the 24 regions was administered by 24 officials, who had under their command 240 armies of spirits, composed of 2400 generals, 2400 officers and 240000 soldiers. This system of administration reflected the utopian system of governance described in the Zhouli.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E
5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to <b>their</b> <b>birth,</b> but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E

Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with <b>their</b> <b>birth.</b> There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after <b>their</b> <b>birth</b> and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.|$|E
