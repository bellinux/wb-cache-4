On the basis of the identified problems of remuneration policy in the budgetary sphere, directions of its reform have been outlined. The importance of improving the tariff terms of remuneration together with developing new approaches to the designing a single <b>tariff</b> <b>grid</b> has been substantiated. The scientific-methodical recommendations on how to assess the complexity of tasks and responsibilities and to categorize them by the wage groups have been provided. It has been suggested that the complexity of tasks and responsibilities should be assessed using the points-factor evaluation method, which is applied in projecting the main wages, making use of grades. The factors for assessing the complexity of tasks and responsibilities according to different positions and jobs in the education sphere, science sphere, and science and technology sphere have been defined, the descriptive levels for certain factors have been developed. The assignment of posts and jobs to the qualifying groups upon the results of an assessment of the complexity of tasks and responsibilities has been determined. It has been concluded that use of the elaborated scientific-methodical recommendations would ensure decent remuneration, objective differentiation, transparency, and individualization of wages...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> are {{the main}} source of income for {{distribution}} system operators (DSOs). Reductions of tariffs increase the cost pressure on DSOs; assuming they work efficiently tariff reductions potentially lead to a decrease of the electricity system's quality if no reliability of supply criteria are incorporated in the regulatory system.

Accommodating wind power in the national power system requires not only technical solutions but also reforms in management, policies and regulations. The National Energy Administration initiated a wind power grid integration and accommodation study showing that China could achieve a wind energy economic potential of 160 GW to 200 GW by 2020, by optimising systematic power development plans, encouraging appropriate deployment of pump storage capacity and gas power peak adjustment, as well as rational development of inter-province power transmission. To achieve this potential, administrative co-ordination needs to be strengthened to increase the provincial capacity of wind power accommodation and promote long-distance inter-provincial and inter-regional transmission of wind power.|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} that people cannot {{react to the}} way distribution <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> are designed does not hold anymore. This is mainly true due to breakthroughs in two game-changing technologies: photovoltaics (PV) and batteries. • By investing in PV and batteries, active consumers push the sunk costs towards passive consumers (equity issue). Ironically, the active consumers can even end up paying more (efficiency issue). To avoid being screwed by the others, active consumers could overinvest.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{agreement}} 195 countries signed in order to lower GHG emis- sions and reduce global warming, Norway has through the Paris Climate Agreement agreed to lower GHG emissions significantly in the future. While other countries are mainly reducing their emissions in the power production sector, Norway s electricity production is accountable for only 3 % of the national GHG emissions, due to a high share of hydro power. Respons- ible for 19 % of national GHG emissions, the road transport sector is a more efficient sector to cut CO 2 -emissions. Through extensive subsidies of electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) panels, {{the goal is to}} have a carbon neutral state by 2050. With more than 300 GW installed PV power worldwide by the end of 2016, Norway is barely taking part in the solar revolution, being only accountable for 27 MW installed capacity, with 11 MW being installed in 2016. In comparison, worldwide installed capacity in 2016 was 75 GW. PV is experiencing this massive growth due to sinking costs, increased energy demand and more climate oriented policies. Meanwhile, because battery costs together with PV costs, have been dropping massively in the last decade, the question of profitability for such distributed energy systems has reached Norway, in spite of low energy prices, semi-low solar irradiation and high investment costs. Due to massive subsidies, Norway reached 100 000 EVs in 2016. Although reducing national GHG emissions, an increased share of EVs could lead to problems in the distribution grid due to high power demand during charging. Meanwhile, an average vehicle is parked 95 % of the time, which results in a huge amount of high power high energy batteries being connected to the grid at all times. These are batteries that in theory could be utilized for load balancing. With increased amount of unpredictable renewable energy production, new challenges arise. Increased distributed energy production leads to bidirec- tional power flow in the distribution grid, and can result in certain problems related to overloading and voltage deviations. In order to face the challenges that come with increased distributed energy production in the shape of PV, the implementation of smart meters (AMS) will take place in every Norwegian residence before the beginning of 2019. With AMS, distribution grid operators can reshape their <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> structures, creating price incentives to control load in order to utilize the gridmore efficiently. AMS also opens the possibility to use smart control to buy cheap energy from the spot price market for storage, in order to either sell or consume when the prices are higher. In order to promote efficient grid use, NVE is developing new <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> structures that assures economic advantage for those who take advantage of these (8). Four new <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> have been utilized in this thesis; energy based, power based, time based and subscription based. By modelling a battery, PV and residence load by using load and irradi- ation data, a household is simulated throughout one year. Utilizing dynamic programming, an optimization algorithm is developed in order to find the optimal operation of the battery that ensures minimal cost for the customer, given that load, spot price, <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> and PV production is known (de- terministic model). At the same time, new <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> are formed to see how new price structures can lead to more efficient use of the grid, espe- cially through optimized use of distributed energy production and storage such as PV and battery utilization. The optimization is performed with both a stationary house battery, and an EV battery, in order to compare how an EV battery can potentially replace a house battery. Results show that PV as of 2017 in Norway is not profitable, but that it with lower investment costs and higher energy prices can be profitable in the future. In addition, EV batteries increases the savings by working as a balancing element, utilizing variations in the spot price and <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> to provide 12. 0 - 19. 2 % savings in symbiosis with PV (depending on <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> structure), compared to the 8. 9 - 14. 4 % when using a house battery with PV (depending on <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> structure). While only the subscription based tariff did the peak load go down annually, while the remaining tariffs either increased or kept the existing peak load of the household. The higher peak loads did not interfere with classic peak load hours on a national basis.

40|$|The {{electricity}} grid {{is needed to}} transport electrical energy from where it is produced to where it is consumed. Mostly this means central generation and local consumption, but increasingly also local generation uses the <b>grid.</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> are charged to the grid users to fund the grid in a sustainable way. These <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> shall generate sufficient revenue but they shall also fulfill further objectives: reflectivity and equity or “fairness”. Reflectivity means that the fee for a user reflects the costs the user caused to society. This shall lead to an efficient grid operation and to optimal grid capacity. Equity is less tangible, and can mean that every user should make an appropriate contribution to covering of the grid costs. For residential users under the traditional operation with central generation and local consumption, rather simple tariffs are designed, which are sufficiently reflective and “fair”. Examples are the purely volumetric tariffs which are applied, for instance, in Belgium or Germany. For a number of years, this operation is transformed: Rising levels of local generation {{can be observed in}} many countries, a trend towards self-generation by “prosumers”, users than consume and generate electricity, emerged and new consumers such as electric vehicles are predicted to spread. This leads to a number of challenges for the existing tariffs. Self-generation by some users, for instance, leads to a drop in revenues for the grid operator, which has to be covered by the other users. Existing tariffs also provide insufficient economic signals reflecting for instance the costs related to injection. The existing tariffs have to be reviewed, thus, and might have to be adapted. In this work, the aspect of adding a capacity component to a <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> for residential <b>grid</b> users, is in the focus. This means that there is a tariff on the instantaneous energy exchange with the grid, not only on the cumulated exchange. Such a tariff is assumed having the advantage of being less sensitive to a reduction of the energy off-take and of providing a stronger economic signal. Accordingly, capacity-based tariffs are currently considered in several countries as an option to address looming challenges from local generation or loads as electric vehicles. Capacity-based tariffs also exist already on other grid levels and in some countries. A major problem is the almost entire lack of research conducted on capacity-based tariffs so far. There is, for instance, basically no research on the question which share of revenue should be raised through a capacity component and which through an energy component. Answering this question {{from the point of view}} of a regulator is in the focus of this work. An answer has to be based on economic and equity objectives. Yet, there is also number of regulatory and technical aspects constraining the fulfillment of the objectives. In this work, at first, relevant aspects of tariff design are presented, including economic models but also regulatory and technical constraints. This outlines especially the difficulties in applying economic principles. Based on that, different approaches to set the tariff components are discussed. Due to the noted difficulties, a focus is seen here on equity. A proposal to a more formalized approach to equity is presented taking into account the assumed relevance. Furthermore, a tool to assess the impact of a user reaction on the tariff objectives is developed. This reaction affects economic objectives but also equity. This outcome after a reaction has to be taken into account for the assessment of a tariff. Based on the tools, a number of recommendations is derived. Finally, the aspect of demand response is integrated into the <b>grid</b> <b>tariff.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Under the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan for 25 percent of final energy consumption in 10 years (AEDP 2012 - 2021), The government of Thailand has planed that the electricity generated by solar power will be 2, 000 MW or 2, 484 GWh. Thailand has moderate solar potential with average annual global radiation of 17 - 18 MJ/m 2. day. Until recently, the incentive of investment to produce electricity from solar power is under government subsidization scheme, or Adder. However, the Adder itself has many constraints such as the limitation of the period of subsidization within 10 years for solar power. This paper investigates the proposed feed-in tariffs in solar photovoltaic through the whole lifetime of the projects by an energy model (RETscreen model) in three categories; (1) residential rooftop, (2) integrated ground mounted and rooftop solar photovoltaic, and (3) utility scale with the installed capacity larger than 1 MW.

The analysis suggests that market power of firms may be part of the reason for the increase in electricity prices in WEMI. The study suggests various measures to increase competition in the WEMI.

40|$|Rising {{levels of}} local {{distributed}} generation and storage by residential grid users {{are difficult to}} integrate into the (energy-based) <b>grid</b> <b>tariffs</b> which are used in several European countries. There are proposals to address this issue, for instance, through capacity-based tariffs. Yet, {{this can lead to}} many possible designs which have to be compared. An important aspect of the comparison is the user reaction to the tariff. Tariffs are ex-ante options to use the grid. Grid-users react to this. The actual suitability of a tariff design is only measurable after the reaction. In this paper, a framework to assess tariffs {{in the context of a}} reaction through self-generation is designed and implemented. At first, a list of efficiency measures for the comparison is formalized. Then, a simulation model framework to quantify the measures is developed. This framework focuses on the interaction of tariff and self-generation using photovoltaic generation and battery storage. As a case study, different tariff schemes are implemented. The case study outlines the importance of considering the user reaction by showing the extent of the interaction. Also, it provides indications for tariff design by showing the effects on grid upgrade costs related to certain tariff components. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper, “Role of Nuclear Energy in Japan Post – Fukushima: Alternatives and their Impact onJapan’s GHG Emission Targets”, is to {{emphasize}} that Japan’s expected new energy policy must be in accordancewith its existing environmental targets with regards to GHG emissions. The main research question is how Japan cancontinue to meet its emissions targets {{in the aftermath of}} the Fukushima crisis, where public opinion—gaugedthrough newspaper articles—in Japan has now become outright anti-nuclear, and Japan has become compelled toadopt a new nuclear-free energy policy built around renewable energy. However, given the extremely low share ofrenewable energy in Japan’s existing energy mix, an extremely pro-nuclear government, an influential energy lobbyand an overall lack of suitable infrastructure; this goal does appear ambitious. The framework of analysis in thispaper will be of ‘sustainable development’, entailing an analysis of the three pillars of sustainability – environment,economy and social factors. In addition to these factors, security of supply will also be considered as a vital measureto determine the policy’s overall sustainability. The paper will show that while it is indeed possible for Japan tomeet its GHG emissions targets by replacing nuclear energy with renewable energy, Japan’s ability to deployrenewable energy at such a large scale remains inadequate. Through a comparison with the German experience inrenewable energy, any withdrawal from nuclear energy without properly propping up renewable energy will onlyresult in a greater shift towards primary fossil fuels – jeopardizing Japan’s emission targets, security of supply andincurring heavy import costs to its economy. The result of this analysis is to suggest measures such as an expansiveFeed-in <b>tariff</b> system, <b>grid</b> integration and stability and investment in R&D as major components of a focused andlong term energy policy up till 2030, to promote renewable energy. This paper will also posit steps required toimprove the safety and efficiency of its nuclear reactors during the interim period when renewable energy grows inits share of Japan’s energy mix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Tariff {{design is}} one of the {{fundamental}} building blocks behind distributed energy <b>grids.</b> Designing <b>tariffs</b> involve considering customer preferences, supply and demand volumes and other competing tariffs. This paper proposes a broker capable of understanding the market supply and demand constraints to issue time-independent tariffs that can be offered to customers (energy producers and con-sumers) on smart <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> markets. The focus of this work is laid on determining the most profitable price on time-independent tariffs. While this type of tariffs are the most simple of all, it allows us to study the fundamental underpinnings be-hind determining tariff prices considering imperfect and semi-rational customers and competing tariffs. Our proposed broker agent —COLD Energy — learns its op-ponents strategy dynamics by reinforcement learning. However, as opposed to sim-ilar methods, its advantage lies in its ability to learn fast and adapt to changing cir-cumstances by using a sufficient and compact representation of its environment. We validate the proposed broker in Power TAC, an annual international trading agent competition that gathers experts from different fields and latitudes. Our results show that the proposed representation is capable of coding the important characteristics of tariff energy markets for fixing energy prices when the competing brokers are non-stationary (learning), irrational, fixed, rational or greedy...|$|R
40|$|Blessed with {{abundant}} solar radiation, Malaysia {{has a huge}} {{potential for}} grid-connected PV (photovoltaic) installations, particularly for its fast-growing residential sector. Nevertheless, Malaysia's PV installation capacity is relatively small compared with the global PV capacity. Significantly, the pricing mechanisms for grid-connected PV projects need to be appropriately assessed {{to build up the}} public's confidence to invest in PV projects. In this paper, we analyze the effects of component costs, FiTs (feed-in tariffs), and carbon taxes on grid-connected PV systems in Malaysian residential sector using the HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. Results demonstrate that the implementation of grid-connected PV systems is highly feasible with PV array costs of $ 1120 /kW or lower. For higher PV array costs up to $ 2320 /kW, introducing an FiT rate three times higher ($ 0. 30 /kWh) than the <b>grid</b> <b>tariff</b> for a 100 kW grid sale capacity will, NPC-wise, prioritize grid-connected PV systems over the utility grid. By implementing the FiT ($ 0. 50 /kWh) and the carbon tax ($ 36 /metric ton) schemes simultaneously, grid-connected PV systems will remain as the optimal systems even for costly PV arrays (up to $ 4000 /kW). The findings are of paramount importance as far as PV pricing variability is concerned...|$|R
