5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Geastrum <b>triplex</b> have been {{chemically}} analyzed and shown {{to contain a}} number of bioactive compounds, including fungal sterols such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, ergosterol, and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various fatty acids, notably myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, alpha-linolenic, and linoeic acid.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum <b>triplex</b> has a {{widespread}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in Asia (China, Korea Iran, and Turkey), Australia, Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden, and the Canary Islands), and Africa (Congo, South Africa). In North America, its range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico, including the whole continental United States and Hawaii. In Central and South America the fungus has been reported from Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.|$|E
40|$|Formation of {{a triple}} helix {{resulting}} from oligonucleotide binding to the DNA double helix offers new possibilities to control gene expression at the transcriptional level. Purine-motif <b>triplexes</b> can be formed under physiological pH. Nevertheless, this formation was inhibited by certain monovalent cations during the association but not during dissociation. Since <b>triplexes</b> are very stable, {{it was possible}} to assemble them in the absence of KCl and have them survive throughout the course of an in vitro transcription reaction. As for the design of a better triplex-forming oligonucleotide, 12 nucleotides in length afforded the highest binding affinity. G/T-rich oligonucleotides can be very polymorphic in solution. The conditions for forming purine-motif <b>triplexes,</b> duplexes or G-quartets were determined. Understanding these parameters will be important for the practical use of G-rich oligonucleotides in the development of DNA aptamers where the structure of the oligonucleotide is paramount in dictating its function. Finally, purine-motif <b>triplexes</b> were demonstrated to significantly inhibit gene transcription in vitro. The optimal effect on this process was dependent on the location of <b>triplexes</b> within the promoter, i. e., whether upstream or proximally downstream of the transcription start site. The mechanism for the inhibition of transcription appeared to be interference with initiation through preventing engagement by RNA polymerase. This finding is revolutionary when compared to the conventional model where <b>triplexes</b> inhibit transcription only by occluding binding by trans-acting proteins. Our findings broaden the utility of <b>triplexes</b> and support a strategy for antigene therapy by <b>triplexes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that d(TC) n. d(GA) n microsatellites may serve as arrest signals for mammalian DNA replication through the ability of such sequences to form DNA triple helices and thereby inhibit replication enzymes. To further test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of d(TC) i. d(GA) i. d(TC) i <b>triplexes</b> to inhibit DNA unwinding in vitro by a model eukaryotic DNA helicase, the SV 40 large T-antigen. DNA substrates that were able to form <b>triplexes,</b> and non-triplex-forming control substrates, were tested. We found that the presence of DNA <b>triplexes,</b> as assayed by endonuclease S 1 and osmium tetroxide footprinting, significantly inhibited DNA unwinding by T-antigen. Strong inhibition was observed not only at acidic pH values, in which the <b>triplexes</b> were most stable, but also at physiological pH values in the range 6. 9 - 7. 2. Little or no inhibition was detected at pH 8. 7. Based on these results, and on previous studies of DNA polymerases, we suggest that DNA <b>triplexes</b> may form in vivo and cause replication arrest through a dual inhibition of duplex unwinding by DNA helicases and of nascent strand synthesis by DNA polymerases. DNA <b>triplexes</b> also have the potential to inhibit recombination and repair processes in which helicases and polymerases are involved...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{bidirectional}} WDM transceiver is a {{key component}} of the Passive Optical Network of the Fiber to the Home topology. Essential parts of such transceivers are filters that combine multiplexing and demultiplexing function of optical signal (<b>triplexing</b> filters). In this paper we report about a design of a new planar optical multi-wavelength selective system <b>triplexing</b> filter, which combines a multimode interference filter with directional coupler based on the epoxy polymer SU- 8 on Si/SiO 2 substrate. The optical <b>triplexing</b> filter was designed using the Beam Propagation Method. The aim of this project was to optimize the <b>triplexing</b> filter optical parameters and to minimize the planar optical wavelength selective system dimensions. The multimode interference filter was used for separation of downstream optical signal in designed optoelectronic integrated WDM transceiver. The directional coupler was used for adding of upstream optical signal...|$|R
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Horne resumed working at <b>Triplex,</b> and was promoted {{to the position of}} sales director. Despite his subsequent joint career in broadcasting and business, his commercial activities always took precedence. He declared that his work on radio was only a hobby, and that he would give it up before his business career. He combined his two roles by working full-time, and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a <b>triplex</b> movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum <b>triplex</b> may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
40|$|Cyclic oligonucleotides {{carrying}} an oligopurine Watson - Crick sequence {{linked to the}} corresponding (G,A) -and (G,T) -antiparallel strands were prepared by nonenzymatic template-assisted cyclization of phosphorylated precursors. Cyclization was attempted using 3 ′-phosphate and 5 ′-phosphate linear precursors with carbodiimide or BrCN activation. The best results were obtained with the 5 ′-phosphorylated precursors and carbodiimide activation. Cyclic oligonucleotides bind polypyrimidine target sequence by formation of antiparallel <b>triplexes.</b> We have used UV and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to analyze <b>triplexes</b> formed by cyclic oligonucleotides carrying G and A in the reverse-Hoogsteen strand. The relative stability of the <b>triplexes</b> formed by cyclic and linear oligonucleotides with a common polypyrimidine target was determined by melting experiments. The most-stable <b>triplexes</b> were formed by the cyclic oligonucleotide, followed by the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated oligonucleotide precursors, and, finally, the corresponding hairpin. Although the differences in binding affinity between cyclic oligonucleotides and their corresponding linear precursors are small, the use of cyclic oligonucleotides offers a clear advantage over conventional duplex recognition.

5|$|In 1954, {{after nine}} years in his senior {{position}} at <b>Triplex,</b> and 27 years at the company, Horne accepted the position of {{managing director of the}} British Industries Fair, a government-backed organisation promoting British goods worldwide; he took up his position in July 1955. Much of the work involved liaising with foreign buyers and delegations, and he accompanied the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on visits to the annual fair. In 1956 the government withdrew its funding and the BIF closed. Horne received several attractive job offers, and chose the post of chairman and managing director of the toy manufacturers Chad Valley, where he was a success. In September that year he and Murdoch appeared in a one-off television programme Show for the Telly.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Walter Chrysler had {{a two-story}} {{apartment}} on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the tallest bathrooms in the world. Chrysler also had a <b>triplex</b> unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing {{to stay at the}} Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic. In 2005, a New York Times report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as the correct name for G.triplex. This is because G.indicum—a species described by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1832 as Cycloderma indicum {{and then moved}} to Geastrum by Stephan Rauschert in 1959—may be the same species as Geastrum <b>triplex.</b> If {{it is in fact}} the same species, the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct name for the species.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Triplexes</b> was banking heavy trains over steep inclines, {{requiring}} high tractive effort, but low speed, over short distances.|$|R
50|$|With all six {{cylinders}} {{operating at}} their full pressure (which {{could not be}} sustained for very long), the <b>Triplexes</b> produced huge amounts of tractive effort (TE) {{that may have been}} the highest of any steam locomotives before or since. (Westing gives a figure of 160000 lbf kN in compound mode and seems to indicate that it was the largest TE for any locomotive up to the time 1914-1916.) The <b>Triplexes</b> could also be considered the largest tank engines ever built since the tender had driving wheels as well and thus contributed to traction. The problem of variable adhesion on the tender unit was not a serious one, since pusher locomotives had frequent opportunities to take on additional fuel and water. In total, only four <b>Triplexes</b> came into existence and only in the United States; all were retired by 1930; none were preserved.|$|R
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with <b>Triplex</b> Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E

5|$|Two prototypes {{were lost}} in accidents, both {{of which had been}} {{primarily}} caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot-induced pitch oscillation. During the type's development, aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability augmentation systems and autopilots. Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies. Failure testing of the Tornado's <b>triplex</b> analogue command and stability augmentation system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, payloads complicated the clearance process.|$|E

Thymine-rich homopyrimidine PNA oligomers recognize double-stranded polynucleotides by forming PNA 2 -DNA <b>triplexes</b> with the DNA purine strand. By contrast, cytosine-rich homopyrimidine PNAs add to double-stranded polynucleotides as Hoogsteen strands, forming PNA-DNA 2 <b>triplexes,</b> while homopurine, or alternating thymine-guanine, PNA oligomers invade DNA to form PNA-DNA duplexes...|$|R
5|$|Geastrum <b>triplex</b> is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} naphthylquinoline triplex-binding ligand on the formation of intermole-cular <b>triplexes</b> on DNA fragments containing the target sites A 6 G 6 ·C 6 T 6 and G 6 A 6 ·T 6 C 6. The ligand enhances the binding of T 6 C 2, but not T 2 C 6, to A 6 G 6 ·C 6 T 6 suggesting that it has a greater effect on T·AT than C+·GC triplets. The complex with T 6 C 2 is only stable below pH 6. 0, confirming the requirement for protonation of the third strand cytosines. Antiparallel <b>triplexes</b> with GT-containing oligonucleotides are also stabilised by the ligand. The complex between G 5 T 5 and A 6 G 6 ·C 6 T 6 is stabilised by lower ligand concentrations than that between T 5 G 5 and G 6 A 6 ·C 6 T 6. The ligand does not promote the interaction with GT-containing oligo-nucleotides which have been designed to bind in a parallel orientation. Although the formation of anti-parallel <b>triplexes</b> is pH independent, we find that the ligand has a greater stabilising effect at lower pH, suggesting that the active species is protonated. The ligand does not promote the binding of antiparallel GA-containing oligonucleotides at pH 7. 5 but induces the interaction between A 5 G 5 and G 6 A 6 ·T 6 C 6 at pH 5. 5. Ethidium bromide does not promote the formation of any of these <b>triplexes</b> and destabilises the interaction of acridine-linked pyrimidine-containing third strands with these target sites...|$|R
