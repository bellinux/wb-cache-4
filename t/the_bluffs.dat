5|$|Erosion {{has been}} a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away from the lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach at the base of <b>the</b> <b>Bluffs</b> have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on <b>the</b> <b>bluffs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known inhabitants {{from about}} 400 A.D. {{were members of}} the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bluff,</b> located halfway {{in between}} Voormezele and Hollebeke, is an {{artificial}} ridge {{in the landscape}} created by spoil from failed attempts to dig a canal. With the additional height in an otherwise relatively flat landscape, <b>The</b> <b>Bluff</b> was an important military objective. German forces took <b>The</b> <b>Bluff</b> in February 1916. In addition to <b>The</b> <b>Bluff,</b> 172nd Tunnelling Company was also responsible for mining at St Eloi south of Ypres.|$|R

5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at <b>the</b> <b>bluffs,</b> units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses {{to the fate of}} neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing {{at either end}} of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of <b>the</b> <b>bluffs,</b> but were also down to half strength.|$|E

5|$|In 1841, Father Lucien Galtier {{was sent}} to {{minister}} to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> above Lambert's Landing. Galtier intended for the settlement to adopt the name Saint Paul {{in honor of the}} new chapel. In 1847, a New York educator named Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 and Saint Paul named as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter. However, Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, thus preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the thirty-second state, with Saint Paul as the capital.|$|E
5|$|L/16 {{eventually}} landed, 30 minutes late, to {{the left}} of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards (180m) of beach. The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of <b>the</b> <b>bluffs.</b> They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.|$|E
5|$|Very little went {{as planned}} during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in {{navigation}} caused {{the majority of}} landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> between the most heavily defended points. By {{the end of the}} day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.|$|E

50|$|At {{the western}} end of the Kawarau Gorge, midway between Cromwell and Queenstown, the highway passes <b>the</b> Nevis <b>Bluff,</b> a steep schist rock outcrop rising 100 m above the Kawarau River. The highway has a history of being {{disrupted}} and closed at this point due to instability and rock falls from <b>the</b> <b>bluff.</b> <b>The</b> first road around <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> was constructed in 1866, opening access to the Wakatipu goldfields. Significant slips occurred at <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> on 1940-02-20, and blocking SH6 in June 1975. On 17 September 2000, a large-scale rock fall buried the highway at <b>the</b> <b>bluff,</b> and several motorists narrowly avoided being killed. The fall was caught on video and showed a volume of 10,000 m³ for the main fall; the resulting dust cloud was seen 5 km away. Transit New Zealand conducted stabilisation drilling and blasting at <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> twice in 2006 and again in 2007.|$|R
5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
5|$|On the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment {{cleared the}} last {{defenders}} from <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast. This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost-Battalion {{to withdraw from}} the Grandcamp area which lay further to the west. Early on June 7 WN-69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south-west, reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D-Day phase line the following day. The third regiment of 29th Division; the 175th, started landing on June 7. By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the 101st Airborne Division, thus linking Omaha with Utah.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{stronghold of}} Vicksburg, Mississippi blocked {{the way for}} {{complete}} Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital for the Union War effort. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured Holly Springs Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant's and Sherman's armies from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman. During this time Grant incorporated fleeing African American slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and paid employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, Sultan Bayezid {{arrived with}} a large army {{to the south of}} the town and took up a strong {{defensive}} position, challenging the crusaders to meet him. The crusader army moved to confront him on 24 September, but poor discipline and fractured leadership between the national factions resulted in a premature assault by the French force against <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> controlled by Ottoman troops. With the allied army strung out, Bayezid marshaled his reserves and defeated the crusaders in a furious engagement in which fell most of the allied army. Thousands more were captured and executed after the battle by the victorious Turkish troops. The exact fate of Sir Jean de Carrouges {{in the midst of this}} melee is unknown but it is probable that he fell close to his commander Jean de Vienne, whose forces were trapped in a gully and decimated by Turkish cavalry. Following his death, his estates passed to his ten-year-old son Robert and a mural of Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges was painted in the Abbey of St. Etienne in Caen to celebrate his memory. Since that time however, both the family and mural have faded into obscurity.|$|E

25|$|Curtis {{placed his}} four small {{divisions}} astride the Telegraph or Wire Road in a fortified position atop <b>the</b> <b>bluffs</b> north of Little Sugar Creek. From the creek, the Telegraph Road went northeast to Elkhorn Tavern where it intersected the Huntsville Road leading east, and Ford Road leading west. From Elkhorn, the Wire Road continued north {{and down into}} Cross Timber Hollow before crossing the border into Missouri. From there, the Federal supply line followed the Telegraph Road northeast to St. Louis.

Curtis made his headquarters at Pratt's Store, located on the Wire Road between Elkhorn and Little Sugar Creek.|$|E
50|$|On September 11 Confederates {{opened fire}} on Union gunboat USS Uncas {{approaching}} <b>the</b> <b>bluff.</b> <b>The</b> USS Patroon joined the USS Uncas and {{opened fire on}} <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> but failed to destroy the Confederate position.

Union reinforcements arrived on October 1 at Mayport Mills. The next day, Union soldiers under Brigadier General J.M. Brannon approached <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> from <b>the</b> rear. Confederate Colonel Charles F. Hopkins was in a panic due to the Union reinforcements approaching from the rear and the Union gunboats still firing on <b>the</b> <b>bluff.</b> Captain Winston Stephens believed the Confederate position could hold off the Federal assault. However, Hopkins decided to order a retreat from the Confederate position on October 2-3. Federals occupied the Confederate position and seized the cannons. Two days later on October 5 the Federals moved on to nearby Yellow Bluff Fort which had also retreated.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> southwest-facing coastal <b>bluff</b> {{present at}} Discovery Park, Seattle, Washington, {{displays}} distinctive joints throughout the exposed Lawton Clay Member. Exhibiting a characteristic local stratigraphy of permeable advance outwash over the impermeable proglacial lacustrine clay, this bluff {{is located in}} an area of Seattle at high risk from landslides. This project addressed the relationship between the joints observed at this coastal <b>bluff</b> and <b>the</b> coherency of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> as a whole, through remote sensing and field measurements. Aerial drone photography taken of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> was processed through a photogrammetry software to produce a 3 -dimensional Structure from Motion model, allowing for a digital manipulation and broad examination of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> not possible by foot. Stereonet plots produced from these measurements provided insight into patterns of varying joint strike along a horizontal transect of <b>the</b> observed <b>bluff</b> face. Taken together, these two visualizations provided a better picture of the possible chicken-and-egg interaction of <b>the</b> joints and <b>bluff</b> topography; they demonstrated the likelihood that the joint formation at <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> was most likely to be primarily influenced by the local topography of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> over other sources of possible tensional stress in the immediate area...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} a single rib on the local heat {{transfer}} around a bluff body are examined by using the steady state liquid crystal technique. By varying the spacing between <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> body and <b>the</b> rib, the interaction between the rib and <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> body can be controlled. <b>The</b> <b>bluff</b> body is oriented vertically towards the flow direction and spans the whole height of <b>the</b> channel. <b>The</b> <b>bluff</b> body has a rectangular cross-section (height b = 80 mm, width 40 mm) while the rib has a square cross-section (rib height e= 10 mm, rib width 10 mm). The rib is placed in the upstream region of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> body either by a spacing L = 100 and 50 mm to yield nondimensional spacing to rib height ratios L/e = 10 and 5 respectively. Here, the re-attachment length (x(R)) for a single rib is about 7. 5 e. The values of the Reynolds number based on the channel hydraulic diameter (D-h) are 55, 000 and 89, 000. The experimental results revealed that the presence of the rib at L/e = 10 has a more pronounced effect on the enhancement of the heat transfer upstream region of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> body. <b>The</b> effect of different L/e on the local Nu number distribution in the wake of <b>the</b> <b>bluff</b> body is small...|$|R
