5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because <b>the</b> <b>invoice</b> was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
25|$|In some states, the {{regulated}} premium charge {{does not include}} part of the underwriting costs necessary for the process. In those states, title insurers may also charge search or abstracting fees for searching the public records, or examination fees to compensate them for the title examination. These fees are usually not regulated and in those cases may sometimes be negotiated. In some states, regulation requires that the title insurer base its policy on the opinion of an attorney. The attorney's fees are not regulated. They are also {{not part of the}} title insurance premium, though the title insurer may include those fees within its invoice as a convenience to the attorney rendering the opinion. Similarly, fees for closing a sale or mortgage transaction are not regulated in most states though the charge for closing may appear in <b>the</b> <b>invoice</b> disclosing the total charges for the transaction.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the method}} of [...] collection, VAT can be accounts-based or invoice-based. Under <b>the</b> <b>invoice</b> method of collection, each seller charges VAT rate on his output and passes the buyer a special invoice that {{indicates}} the amount of tax charged. Buyers who are subject to VAT on their own sales (output tax), consider the tax on the purchase invoices as input tax and can deduct the sum from their own VAT liability. The difference between output tax and input tax is paid to the government (or a refund is claimed, {{in the case of}} negative liability). Under the accounts based method, no such specific invoices are used. Instead, the tax is calculated on the value added, measured as a difference between revenues and allowable purchases. Most countries today use <b>the</b> <b>invoice</b> method, the only exception being Japan, which uses the accounts method.|$|E

An ES Limited model listing for $19,978 was only $15,478 (adjusted for inflation equivalent to US$ in [...] dollars after the marketing incentives.

2500|$|The house {{consists}} of a central stuccoed block of three floors with a basement divided into five bays, with a flanking pavilion of two stories in four bays, to either side connected by low flanking quadrant walls. In {{the centre of the}} front is a large classical pedimented portico fronted by four [...] Ionic columns. The flanking walls screen the service wings behind. The rear elevation [...] has on either side full-height semi-circular bays. The interior contains much Adam style decorative plasterwork, apparently the work of a certain Mr Powell [...] referred to in <b>the</b> <b>invoice</b> from the builder Bellman, and ornamental fittings. Robert Adam did much work for the Parkers at Saltram House near Plymouth between 1768–72 and 1779–82. The Poles are likely to have been guests at their neighbours at this time, but in any case as they also spent much time in London at their house in Bedford Square, they would have been familiar with Adam's work in London and elsewhere. The north-east pavilion contains a [...] theatre of circa 1900. The top floor housed the servants' quarters. The kitchens were originally situated in the left hand pavilion, later converted into a theatre. A large Palladian style stables block is situated around a semi-circular courtyard, several [...] hundred yards from the house, now converted into several separate residences. It had stabling for twelve horses and accommodation for grooms.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{currency}} <b>invoicing</b> {{patterns of}} firms in Japan {{is one of}} the most interesting research issues, because, unlike other developed countries, it is not the yen but the U. S. dollar that plays a major role in currency invoicing of Japanese trade. However, detailed data on <b>the</b> <b>invoicing</b> choice is not available, presenting a major obstacle to rigorous empirical examination. To overcome such a lack of data, we sent a questionnaire to all TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange) listed firms in the manufacturing industry in September 2009, and received questionnaire responses from 227 firms. The questionnaire covers various information not only on <b>the</b> firms' <b>invoicing</b> choice by industry, destination, and type of trading partners, but also on the firms' foreign exchange rate risk management. The survey results are classified by industry and firm size, using annual securities reports of sample firms, through which new evidence on <b>the</b> firm's <b>invoicing</b> choice is presented. Our findings provide significant implications for further economic integration and monetary arrangements in the region. ...|$|R
