The {{major part of the}} paper is introducing a new way of <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> testing by clubbing of <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test and Integration test into one unit. In this testing the main aim is to reduce the errors occur in the code and while integration. While in the KRS test approach we try to increase the efficiency of the testing with the help of KRS <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test. This new approach is built only by considering the KRS <b>unit</b> <b>code</b> test. I...|$|R

The antenna has a flexible antenna carrier (4) {{made up of}} a flat material, and an antenna structure (5) which is connected with the carrier. The antenna carrier is detachably fixed to the <b>transport</b> <b>unit.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The antenna carrier is removed from the <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> and reused for a new transport and storage application after the current transport and storage application. USE - Used for transporting and storing objects. ADVANTAGE - The antenna carrier is detachably fixed to the <b>transport</b> <b>unit,</b> hence an optional transporting carrier can be equipped quickly, safely and economically with a radio technological infrastructure for safe transport and storage of the objects. The antenna carrier is removed from the <b>transport</b> <b>unit</b> and reused for a new transport and storage application after the current transport and storage application, thus the usage of expensive <b>transport</b> <b>units</b> is reduced...|$|R
