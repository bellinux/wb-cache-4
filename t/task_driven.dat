If the reduction of self-standard discrepancy seems ineffiecient or impossible, people will often seek to avoid or escape self-awareness altogether. Studies examine these psychological processes by examining how people react to demanding tasks. Research has found that self-focused people that deem their rate of progress on a task unacceptable {{will be more likely to}} avoid the task goals and therefore escape states of <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> self-awareness.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} sensor scheduling methods that {{are driven by}} information theoretic measures. In the information driven approach, the relative merit of different sensing actions {{is measured by the}} corresponding expected gain in information. Information driven approaches stand in stark contrast to <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> methods, i. e., methods that select some physical performance criteria and explicitly manage the sensor based on that criteria. This paper investigates the difference between a particular information driven approach, one that maximizes an alpha-Rényi measure of information gain, and <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> methods with a combination of theory and simulation. First, we give a mathematical relation that shows that when the decision error depends only weakly on the target state a certain type of marginalized information gain is a close approximation to the Bayes risk associated with performing a specific task. Second, we perform an empirical comparison between information driven and <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> approaches that maximize information gain or minimize risk, respectively. In particular, we give a <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> method that uses the sensor {{in a manner that is}} expected to maximize the probability the target is correctly located after the next measurement. We find as expected that the <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> method outperforms the information driven method when the performance is measured by risk, i. e., probability of localization error. However, the performance difference between the two methods is very small, suggesting that the information gain is a good surrogate for risk for this application...|$|E

40|$|Many {{effective}} supervised discriminative dictionary learning {{methods have}} been developed in the literature. However, when training these algorithms, precise ground-truth of the training data is required to provide very accurate point-wise labels.

40|$|PURPOSE: A core {{function}} for any visual system (biological and artificial) is recognising objects by grouping and filling-in image elements {{as a figure}} and segregating them from the background. Neural mechanisms of Figure–Ground (F–G) segmentation {{have been linked to}} processes operating across several cortical areas including primary visual cortex (V 1), and depend heavily on re-entrant feedback connections. F–G is thought to be a cortical phenomenon, however we recently observed strong F–G modulation in the earliest visual area in the brain, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN). Our previous study assumed that F–G segmentation observed in the LGN was mostly stimulus, and not <b>task</b> <b>driven.</b> By adding a second figure target, we wished to test whether this was the case. 	METHODS: We performed tetrode recordings of spiking and local field potentials (LFP) in behaving macaque dLGN. We used speeded reaction–time where the subject had to find, and then saccade to either of two moving-dot defined visual figural objects against a moving background. The choice depended on a simple distance metric. 	RESULTS: When we divide attentional demand across two figural objects, we find that LGN cells are differentially driven by both the visual component and the saccaded to location of the task. LFP signal analysis suggests this task activity is driven predominantly within the α–band. 	CONCLUSIONS: We find that relay cells in the LGN respond not only to the visual cues alone, but also exhibit differential activity whether the figural object was going to be chosen for a subsequent saccade or not. The α–band dominated LFP suggests feedback as the most parsimonious route of this <b>task</b> <b>driven</b> modulation. Future experiments aim to orthogonally control spatial and feature attention while causally manipulating the feedback using optogenetic approaches. </p...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{function}} can {{be affected}} by the estrous cycle. However, the effect of the estrous cycle on synaptic functions is poorly understood. Here we show that in female rats, inhibitory-avoidance (IA) task (hippocampus-dependent contextual fear-learning <b>task)</b> <b>drives</b> GluA 2 -lacking Ca 2 +-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) into the hippocampal CA 3 -CA 1 synapses during all periods of the estrous cycle except the proestrous period, when estrogen levels are high. In addition, IA <b>task</b> failed to <b>drive</b> CP-AMPARs into the CA 3 -CA 1 synapses of ovariectomized rats only when estrogen was present. Thus, changes in the stoichiometry of AMPA receptors during learning depend on estrogen levels. Furthermore, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) after IA task was prevented during the proestrous period, while intact LTP is still expressed after IA task during other period of the estrous cycle. Consistent with this finding, rats conditioned by IA training failed to acquire hippocampus-dependent Y-maze task during the proestrous period. On the other hand, during other estrous period, rats were able to learn Y-maze task after IA conditioning. These results suggest that high estrogen levels prevent the IA learning-induced delivery of CP-AMPARs into hippocampal CA 3 -CA 1 synapses and limit synaptic plasticity after IA task, thus preventing the acquisition of additional learning...|$|R
