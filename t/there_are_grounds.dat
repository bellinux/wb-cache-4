5|$|The {{formation}} of an astatine compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily oxidized; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and precipitates readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E
25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason to believe <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> which would justify the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – if the police officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot go behind the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E
25|$|Norman and Bennett {{note that}} some studies that {{compared}} alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism {{is linked to}} increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity {{has been found in}} studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and smoking cessation, although they also point out that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism {{is directly related to the}} strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.|$|E

Warfare such as there was in the southern Aegean early Bronze Age was either personalized and perhaps ritualized (in Crete) or small-scale, intermittent and essentially an economic activity (in the Cyclades and the Argolid/Attica).

2500|$|After the contest, Russian {{broadcaster}} Channel One {{complained that}} Irish broadcaster RTÉ {{had used a}} back-up jury, {{and that it had}} cost them victory. A statement by Channel One said [...] "Considering [...] insignificant difference in points between the first and third places, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> to believe that the contest results could be much different for Russia." [...] On the night of the competition, the voting polls operated by Irish telecommunications company Eircom suffered a delay in delivering the results on time, which prompted RTÉ to use the votes of the back-up jury instead. The EBU cleared RTÉ of any potential wrongdoing after an investigation on the matter and stated that the rules concerning substituting the back-up jury in place of the televote were correctly applied. RTÉ later published the unused results of the televote, which showed that had the jury not been used, Turkey would still have won, and Ireland's voting [...] "partners", the United Kingdom, would still have no points. Russia did not receive any points from the televote, however, since Belgium only received 2 points from the Irish televote as opposed to 10 points awarded by the Irish jury, Russia would have placed second.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the trial, presiding judge Tomas Norström, the same judge that ordered the 2006 raid on The Pirate Bay's servers, came under scrutiny after allegations of bias. Sveriges Radio P3 News organized an investigation that found on 23 April that Norström had several engagements with organisations interested in intellectual property issues. Peter Danowsky, Monique Wadsted and Henrik Pontén from the prosecution side are also members of one of the organisations, the Swedish Copyright Association (SFU). Wadsted commented that all intellectual property lawyers in Stockholm are part of the association. According to Norström, the organisations are involved in discussion about copyright, while the earlier lay judges's organisation advocates further copyright protection. Norström however also sits in the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property, which along with the SFU are the Swedish branches of International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property (AIPPI) and Association littéraire et artistique internationale (ALAI). AIPPI's website states that [...] "the objective of AIPPI is to improve and promote the protection of intellectual property on both an international and national basis", and ALAI's president Victor Nabhan commented that his organisation is dedicated mostly to defending copyright holders' interests. Several legal experts have commented that the judge should not have taken the case because of the potential conflict of interest or should at least have mentioned it {{in the beginning of the}} trial, and that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> for a retrial. The district court itself however defended judges' membership in these types of organisations, and it is not uncommon for lay judges to even be sitting municipal politicians.|$|E

Both France and Great Britain have a sense of righteousness in this war such as no nation, no people, has ever felt in war before. We know we are {{fighting}} to save all the world from the rule of force and the unquestioned supremacy of the military idea. Few Frenchmen or Englishmen can imagine the war presenting itself to an American intelligence under any other guise. At the invasion of Belgium we were astonished that America did nothing. At the sinking of the Lusitania all Europe looked to America. The British mind contemplates the spectacle of American destroyers acting as bottleholders to German submarines with a dazzled astonishment. [...] "Manila," [...] we gasp. In England we find excuses for America in our own past. In '64 we betrayed Denmark; in '70 we deserted France. The French have not these memories.

[...] They believe they had some share in the independence of America, that there is a sacred cause in republicanism, that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>grounds</b> for a peculiar sympathy between France and the United States in republican institutions.
