The prime and permanent function of a <b>metropolis</b> is <b>the</b> coordination of economic activities at a world scale.

5|$|Faced with Shapur's third campaign, the Roman emperor Valerian marched {{against the}} Persian monarch but was {{defeated}} near Edessa {{in late spring}} 260 and taken as a prisoner. The Persian emperor then ravaged Cappadocia, Cilicia and claimed to have captured Antioch, <b>the</b> <b>metropolis</b> of Syria. Taking advantage of the situation, Fulvius Macrianus, {{the commander of the}} imperial treasury, declared his sons Quietus and Macrianus Minor as joint emperors in August 260 opposing Valerian's son Gallienus. Fulvius Macrianus took Antioch as his center and organized the resistance against Shapur; he dispatched Balista, his praetorian prefect, to Anatolia. Shapur was defeated in the region of Sebaste at Pompeiopolis prompting the Persians to evacuate Cilicia while Balista went back to Antioch. Balista's victory was only partial, as Shapur withdrew east of Cilicia where the marauding Persian units continued to occupy the area, while a Persian force took advantage of Balista's return to Syria and headed further west in Anatolia.|$|E

A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval, and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds.|$|E
5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} {{basilica}} plan churches with domed galleries that create a five-domed cross-in-square over a ground-level basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of <b>the</b> <b>Metropolis</b> church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E
