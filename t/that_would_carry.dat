5|$|In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was {{designated}} test director on 14 October, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set {{out with a}} group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

25|$|The small 174th Street Yard lies under Broadway, {{with two}} tracks exiting {{to the south}} under that roadway. When the George Washington Bridge was {{designed}} in the 1920s, provisions were made for a lower deck <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> these two tracks north from the yard and across the bridge, {{as well as two}} commuter rail tracks. However, when the lower level was added in 1962, it instead carried a roadway.|$|E
25|$|In November 1845 Samuel Brannan, newspaperman and {{small-scale}} {{publisher of}} the Mormon paper The Prophet (later the New York Messenger), was directed by church elders to charter a ship <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over {{the course of two}} months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children—238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|Mutemath {{started in}} 2002 {{as a long}} {{distance}} collaboration between Paul Meany in New Orleans, Louisiana and Darren King in Springfield, Missouri. The two {{had known each other}} from their work together in Meany's previous band Earthsuit. Occasionally Paul would receive instrumental demo CDs from Darren. Fairly impressed with his efforts, Paul contacted Darren and asked if he could mess with the demos a bit, adding some ideas of his own. Darren obliged and the two would set in motion a sort of songwriting ping-pong match <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> on for several months.|$|E

25|$|Ordered on 30 April 1795, Cambrian was {{designed}} by Sir John Henslow and built by George Parsons of Bursledon. She represented the first attempt to design a frigate <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 24-pounder guns {{and was one of}} several designs the Admiralty ordered to find a counter to French 24-pounder frigates. For her design, Henslow essentially simply scaled-up an earlier design. However, she was still too small to carry 24-pounder long guns comfortably and so the Admiralty replaced these first with lighter 24-pounders (in April 1799) and then with 18-pounders in 1805.|$|E
25|$|In {{acknowledging}} {{these conditions}} Ridgway notified MacArthur that he currently was developing {{plans for an}} advance <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> Eighth Army forces ten to twenty miles (15–30km) above the parallel to a general line following the upstream trace of the Yesong River as far as Sibyon-ni in the west, falling off gently southeastward to the Hwach'on Reservoir, then running east to the coast. As in past and current operations, the objective would be the destruction of enemy troops and materiel. MacArthur approved Ridgway's concept but also scheduled a visit to Korea for March 24, when he would {{have an opportunity to}} discuss the plans in more detail.|$|E
25|$|Tessman {{had also}} {{received}} training in evangelism at Moody Bible Institute. In the early 1920s, she and Albert moved to Bellwood {{and established a}} church in their home on Monroe Street. She named her church the Bellwood Gospel Tabernacle, but was commissioned as a missionary by Epiphany Baptist Church in 1924. At that time, she formally established the Light of the World Rescue Mission and held weekly worship services along with evangelism and outreach ministries. The congregation flourished for more than 20 years, but {{with the death of}} her husband and her advancing age, she began to search for a denomination <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> on the ministry after she left.|$|E

25|$|The first {{train to}} reach Galveston left Houston {{on the morning}} of September 8 at 9:45a.m. It found the tracks washed out, and {{passengers}} were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track slowed the train's progress to a crawl. The 95 travelers on the train from Beaumont found themselves at the Bolivar Peninsula waiting for the ferry <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> them, train and all, to the island. When it arrived, the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock. The train crew attempted to return the way they had come, but rising water blocked the train's path.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{engineer}} Christian Menn {{took over}} {{the design of the}} bridge. He suggested a cradle cable-stayed bridge <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world, having since been surpassed by the Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Tange envisioned {{that the}} Expo should be {{primarily}} {{conceived as a}} big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, {{all of which were}} united under one huge roof. In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the space frame roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.|$|E

25|$|When the U.S. Navy {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a fleet defense missile fighter in 1959, Douglas responded with the F6D Missileer, essentially an updated and enlarged F3D <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> the AAM-N-10 Eagle long-range air-to-air missile, with the most important characteristics being its generous fuel capacity, its considerable time-on-station, a crew of two and sophisticated electronics, rather than speed or maneuverability. This concept which kept the straight wings {{in an age of}} supersonic jets was soon cancelled because it {{would not be able to}} defend itself against more nimble fighters. Its weapons system would be adapted for the supersonic swing-wing General Dynamics-Grumman F-111B, the U.S. Navy version of a joint USAF/USN tactical jet aircraft which also specified side-by-side seating. The USAF version would eventually see service as an air-to-ground fighter bomber, but the Navy version, envisioned as a Fleet Air Defense fighter and dogfighter, would be cancelled when it was clear that its performance was not sufficient for an air-to-air dogfighter role. The AWG-9/Phoenix and TF30 turbofan engine would eventually enter service on the F-111B's successor, the swing-wing Grumman F-14 Tomcat.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, France {{pressed for}} an {{independent}} European crew launch vehicle. Around 1978 {{it was decided to}} pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of Hermes was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the Space Shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the Ariane 5 rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in Low-Earth orbit space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the Soviet Union ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The Columbus space station programme had a similar fate.|$|E
25|$|When the State {{was created}} in 1948 the {{overwhelming}} majority of the population was concentrated in a narrow coastal strip. One of the main tasks of the newly established Government Planning Department, headed by Sharon and directly responsible to the Prime Minister’s Office under David Ben-Gurion, was to find solutions for the great waves of immigrants who entered Israel after the declaration of Independence. The team consisted of 180 urban planners, architects, engineers and economists. They set up a National Outline Plan, dividing the country into planning regions in accordance with economic resources, geographic features, communication factors and historical background. The regional structure would be completed by the development of a regional urban center – a medium-sized town. Thus the plan provided for the establishment of 20 new towns, dispersed all over the country and established guidelines for industrial estates to be located close to the new towns. Sharon's plan led to the creation of development towns for example: Beit She'an, Kiryat Gat, and Upper Nazareth. Agricultural regions were planned expanding into the southern Negev desert. A national water plan was set up <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>carry</b> water from the surplus areas in the north to the dry, water-poor areas in the south. And a network of National Parks was devised, spreading all over the country, exploiting the existing landscape features, nature reserves and historical sites. At the end of 1953, Sharon was invited by the United Nations to serve as a planning expert in a Seminar on Housing and Community Improvement, held in New Delhi, and afterwards to Burma and Japan.|$|E
