40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the current {{availability}} of Arabic young adult literature <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> and to systematically analyze Arabic young adult literature <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> in terms of their cultural authenticity. By analyzing the contents of the <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> through the lenses of literary merit and Arabic culture, I hoped to fill a gap in the current discourse knowledge which does not adequately include the Arab experience. The following research questions guided my study: (1) What is the current availability of Arabic young adult literature, both written in English and available in English translation?, (2) What is the most accurate criterion for determining the authenticity of the currently available Arabic YA texts?, (3) How are Arab young adults represented in Arabic young adult <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> and how culturally authentic are these representations?, and (4) How do insider and/or outsider perspectives and membership and/or nonmembership influence the books’ authenticity? In order to address these questions, my methodology consisted of content analyses of 48 Arabic young adult literature <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> that were written in English or had been made available in English translation. ^ I analyzed books written by members and non-members. Using these researcher-developed evaluation tools, I determined the cultural authenticity of these trade books; First-Impression Form, Overall-Impression Form, and Three-Dimensional Protocol, in addition to the application of an adapted version of Sims Bishop’s guiding questions in her book Shadow and Substance, 1982. One of the major findings of this study was that the available Arabic young adult literature is divided into two categories of trade books: (1) contemporary fiction Arabic young adult literature <b>trade</b> <b>books,</b> and (2) Adapted classical Arabic folk literature <b>trade</b> <b>books.</b> All but one of the available <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> that I could find were published/edited/republished between 1991 and 2008. The majority of the available <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> were informed by an Arab insider perspective to be intended for general audiences, specifically Americans and Arab/Muslim-Americans to address two main themes; the consequences of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on Arab young adults, and growing up as Muslim/Arab-American teenagers in post September 11, 2001 America. ^ Another important finding of this study was the creation of three assessment tools, especially the Three-Dimensional Protocol that includes an abundance of cultural items or factors that are expected to be addressed in an Arabic YA <b>trade</b> <b>book</b> to be of high quality and authenticity. Despite increases in Arabic young adult literature <b>trade</b> <b>books,</b> both in quality and quantity, the number is still not commensurate with Arab students’ population in Arabic and American schools. And the <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> that were assessed as highly authentic in terms of the representation of the Arabic cultural nuances were mainly by Arab members, while non-members tended to portray Arabic observational cultural details with less sensitivity to the Arab experience. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: State and {{national}} education initiatives provide American students {{with opportunities to}} engage in close readings of complex texts from diverse perspectives as they actively construct complicated understandings as they explore complex texts. Opportunities for interdisciplinary units emerge as the role of non-fiction in English/language arts and informational texts in history/social studies increases dramatically. <b>Trade</b> <b>books</b> are a logical curricular link between these two curricula. The initiatives, however, do not prescribe specific curricular material so teachers rely on their own discretion when selecting available <b>trade</b> <b>books.</b> Scholarship indicates that historical misrepresentations emerge within <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> to varying degrees, yet only a few empirical studies have been conducted. We empirically evaluated <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> centered on the Holocaust, which {{is arguably the most}} consequential global event in 20 th century. It is also a curricular element of U. S. history, world history, and English/language arts. We report various misrepresentations within the <b>trade</b> <b>books</b> regarding the Holocaust’s origins, targeted victims, victim totals, contributors, and recognition of other genocidal acts. We provide ancillary primary sources for teachers interested in addressing or balancing the historical misrepresentations. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Nazi-initiated 1940 s industrial genocide, or Holocaust, is certainly the 20 th century’s nadir an...|$|R

5000|$|Because CDOs {{linked to}} bespoke {{portfolios}} are, by their nature, only held {{by one or}} {{a very small number}} of investors, there is no liquid market where they can be bought, sold or valued. Therefore, these CDOs are valued using mathematical models that performed poorly both before and during the financial crisis. [...] Subsequently banking industry regulators have pointed out concerns applicable to CDO tranches on bespoke portfolios that exceed even the regulators' concerns about index-based tranches (which are referred to as [...] "standardized products" [...] in regulatory literature). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme tested banks' internal models to identify the factors [...] "contributing to the observed variability in <b>trading</b> <b>book</b> RWAs".

50|$|Investment {{banks that}} offer this product usually take a riskless {{position}} by hedging the client's {{position with the}} underlying asset.

The bank pays the return on this investment to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own <b>trading</b> <b>book</b> (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against realised profit or loss on its own investment in the underlying asset. The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself).
