25|$|One of {{the highest}} {{recorded}} instrumented Mach numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the Mach 0.891 for a Spitfire PR XI, flown during dive tests at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough in April 1944. The Spitfire, a photo-reconnaissance variant, the Mark XI, fitted with an extended 'rake type' multiple pitot system, was flown by Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin to this speed, corresponding to a corrected <b>true</b> <b>airspeed</b> (TAS) of 606mph. In a subsequent flight, Squadron Leader Anthony Martindale achieved Mach 0.92, but it ended in a forced landing after over- revving damaged the engine.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the <b>true</b> <b>airspeed</b> at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed {{to estimate the}} delay in the terminal area due to excess leading/trailing aircraft wake vortex spacing. This analysis makes use of a large database of recorded traffic from early 2010 at several of the busiest Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACONs) in the United States. To facilitate delay estimates, two arrival compression models are developed and applied to the recorded arrival traffic. A key feature of the compression modeling {{is the use of}} just two discrete points in the trajectory: TRACON entry and runway threshold crossing, eliminating the need for the resource intensive procedure of trajectory reconstruction. The analysis has two parts and each part focuses on two runways that are dedicated entirely to arrivals: KATL 27 L and KDEN 35 R. The first part is a sensitivity study exploring two strategies for compressing the arrivals: path reduction with original average <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds</b> and path reduction with (often times) faster average <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> This sensitivity study results in a range of delay savings on the order of tens of seconds per flight. The rest of the analysis uses the path compression model (original average <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds),</b> showing the uneven variation of daily delay savings at KATL 27 L. Cumulative distribution functions capture the excess spacing reductions. They show a 10 % increase (relative to the observed excess spacing) in arrivals landing with an excess spacing of 0. 5 nmi or less at KATL 27 L and a 25 % increase at KDEN 35 R...|$|R

Because the aircraft will operate at extreme altitudes, in only 3% of sea level atmospheric pressure, {{it will also be}} flying at <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds</b> in excess of 0.5 Mach. The aircraft was designed to minimize flutter and manage shock wave formation.|$|R
500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} position error. [...] A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's <b>true</b> <b>airspeed.</b> [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor downwash. [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.|$|E

Flights determined aerodynamic loads, vibration, stability and control affects in straight and level, flight dive and LABS maneuvers.

40|$|NASA's Orion Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) Project {{is now in}} the {{qualification}} {{phase of}} testing, and the Adams simulation has continued to evolve to model the complex dynamics experienced during the test article extraction and separation phases of flight. The ability to initiate tests near the upper altitude limit of the Orion parachute deployment envelope requires extractions from the aircraft at 35, 000 ft-MSL. Engineering development phase testing of the Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) carried by the Carriage Platform Separation System (CPSS) at altitude resulted in test support equipment hardware failures due to increased energy caused by higher <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds.</b> As a result, hardware modifications became a necessity requiring ground static testing of the textile components to be conducted and a new ground dynamic test of the extraction system to be devised. Force-displacement curves from static tests were incorporated into the Adams simulations, allowing prediction of loads, velocities and margins encountered during both flight and ground dynamic tests. The Adams simulation was then further refined by fine tuning the damping terms to match the peak loads recorded in the ground dynamic tests. The failure observed in flight testing was successfully replicated in ground testing and true safety margins of the textile components were revealed. A multi-loop energy modulator was then incorporated into the system level Adams simulation model and the effect on improving test margins be properly evaluated leading to high confidence ground verification testing of the final design solution...|$|R
2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying airspeed are indicated airspeed ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), <b>true</b> <b>airspeed</b> ("TAS"), and density airspeed. [...] Indicated airspeed is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated airspeed is indicated airspeed adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. [...] <b>True</b> <b>airspeed</b> is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of indicated airspeed, while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, <b>true</b> <b>airspeed</b> increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|E
2500|$|Ground {{speed is}} {{the speed of}} the {{aircraft}} relative to the ground, which is the aircraft's <b>true</b> <b>airspeed</b> combined with {{the speed of the}} air mass (i.e., wind) in which it is flying.

40|$|The {{failure of}} wing panels {{on a number}} of TBF- 1 and TBM- 1 {{airplanes}} in flight has prompted several investigations of the possible causes of failure. This report describes tests in the Langley 16 -foot high-speed tunnel to determine whether these failures could be attributed to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the ailerons at high speeds. The tests were made of a 12 -foot-span section including the tip and aileron of the right wing of a TBF- 1 airplane. Hinge moments, control-link stresses due to aerodynamic buffeting, and fabric-deflection photographs were obtained at <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds</b> ranging from 110 to 365 miles per hour. The aileron hinge-moment coefficients were found to vary only slightly with airspeed in spite of the large fabric deflections that developed as the speed was increased. An analysis of these results indicated that the resultant hinge moment of the ailerons as installed in the airplane would tend to restore the ailerons to their neutral position for all the high-speed flight conditions covered in the tests. Serious aerodynamic buffeting occurred at up aileron angles of - 10 degrees or greater because of stalling of the sharp projecting lip of the Frise aileron. The peak stresses set up in the aileron control linkages in the buffeting condition were as high as three times the mean stress. During the hinge-moment investigation, flutter of the test installation occurred at airspeeds of about 150 miles per hour. This flutter condition was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with this flutter condition and was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with the motion of the wing through the mass unbalance of the aileron in the normal-to-chord plane due to location of the hinge line 2. 17 inches below the center of gravity of the aileron. Flutter did not occur when the installation was stiffened to prevent chordwise motion or when the bending frequency of the aileron system was appreciably higher than that of the wing as in the complete airplane installation...|$|R
50|$|A great {{upgrade to}} the basic concept was {{introduced}} by Harry Wimperis, better known for his later {{role in the development}} of radar in England. In 1916 he introduced the Drift Sight, which added a simple system for directly measuring the wind speed. The bomb aimer would first dial in the altitude and airspeed of the aircraft. Doing so rotated a metal bar on the right side of the bombsight so it pointed out from the fuselage. Prior to the bomb run, the bomber would fly at right angles to the bomb line, and the bomb aimer would look past the rod to watch the motion of objects on the ground. He would then adjust the wind speed setting until the motion was directly along the rod. This action measured the wind speed, and moved the sights to the proper angle to account for it, eliminating the need for separate calculations. A later modification was added to calculate the difference between <b>true</b> and indicated <b>airspeed,</b> which grows with altitude. This version was the Drift Sight Mk. 1A, introduced on the Handley Page O/400 heavy bomber. Variations on the design were common, like the US Estoppey bombsight.|$|R
40|$|The {{long-haul}} {{flights of}} airlines are {{impacted by the}} en-route wind fields. Flights on the same route with different directions may have significantly different flight performances. It may benefit to airlines in terms of fuel cost and on-time performance if the optimal long-haul routes are able to plan. However, the wind direction and strength are varying in different regions, at different altitudes and different times. It is difficult to identify the most suitable trajectory in a complex wind field. Consequently, the trajectory optimization problem is proposed. The main goal {{of this study is}} to develop an optimization model to identify the near optimal trajectory with minimum consumption for long-haul flights taking into account en-route winds and a set of constraints based on ATC regulations. One of the methods to solve the problem is the genetic algorithm since it is a global search method. For this purpose the software tool NSGA is applied in this study. However, the computational process of NSGA is not very efficient due to the computational loss for infeasible solutions. In order to overcome the computational inefficiency of NSGA, a 2 -phase approach is proposed. Phase 1 is to reduce the search scope for Phase 2, while the outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions with the accurate fuel consumption and flight time of the trajectories. Moreover, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to minimize the number of infeasible solutions and the control parameters. The control variables of Phase 1 are the coordinates of waypoints, <b>true</b> <b>airspeeds</b> of segments, distances of vertical segments, and the altitude changing locations. Infeasible solutions may be generated with excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations. In order maintain the feasibility of evaluated solutions, an algorithm is introduced to locate the latitude feasible range of each waypoint. Additionally, approaches based on parameterization are introduced to ensure that the evaluated trajectories terminate at the city pair. By applying these approaches, the number of infeasible solutions due to the excess flight distance and/or random terminated locations is significantly reduced. Although the approaches proposed are able to reduce the number of the control parameters, long computational time is still required to evaluate each solution with a small time or distance step. In order to increase the computational speed, the equivalent wind speed and equivalent weight concepts are proposed in Phase 1. By applying this approach, the distance step is able to increase to a segment distance. The computational efficiency is increased. The outcomes of Phase 2 are detailed solutions. With the involved climbing and descent phases, the number of parameters in Phase 2 is more than the number of parameters in Phase 1. The search scope of Phase 2 is based on the outcomes of Phase 1 to obtain detailed solution within an acceptable computational time. In this study, the forward simulation is applied to ensure the feasibility of the flight altitude. However, the constant landing weight is hardly achieved by applying this algorithm. The transport losses may occur if there is fuel left when the aircraft arrives at the destination. In order to solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed to adjust the initial take-off weight if the final landing weight is not within the expected range. The verification in this study shows that the designed tool is quality and credible. The tool is able to detect the tailwind and headwind in a real wind field. The outcomes of the tool are a little deviated to the optimal solution, but the deviation is acceptable after analysing. In this study, three routes are researched, which are Amsterdam and New York, Amsterdam and Johannesburg, Amsterdam and Singapore. The average saving in terms of flight time and fuel consumption of the optimized solutions are 3. 16 % and 3. 1 % respectively compared to the solutions with the great circle path and optimized vertical profile. The results achieved in this study are promising, but enhancements can be made in the some areas. The optimization processes discussed in this study were only performed for one type of aircraft. More aircraft models can be analysed to further prove the performance of the designed tool. The current program assumes a standard atmosphere. As the pressure and temperature are of great influence on both the air density which further impacts the performance of the engine. A more elaborate atmospheric model could be introduced to obtain more accurate solutions. The tool designed in this study is based on Matlab. With more efficient software, the computational time can be dramatically decreased. Additionally, the use of a better equipped computer with multi processers will significantly increase the computational efficiency. In addition, well-designed termination criterions are recommended when there are multi closed local optimal solutions in the search space, which will increase the computational efficiency during the optimization process.
