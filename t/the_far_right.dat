5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} <b>the</b> British <b>far</b> <b>right's</b> {{attempts to}} construct a 'true', authentic and 'wholesome' version of culture since 1945. It analyses <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right's</b> prescription for political and cultural renewal via a brief exploration of three neo-fascist movements operating after 1945 : the Union Movement (formed in 1948), the National Front (formed in 1967), and the British National Party (formed in 1982). The chapter provides a general overview of the common ideas expressed in the discourse of the three movements regarding cultural and aesthetic representations, and how these have shaped <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right's</b> claims about national identity...|$|R

Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union's extreme left flank, inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|Livingstone {{continued}} {{his association with}} members of Trotskyite group Socialist Action, with the group's leader John Ross became his most important adviser, teaching him about economics. Investing in an advanced £25,000 computer, he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis, {{on the basis of}} which they began publishing the Socialist Economic Bulletin in 1990. Two other members of the group, Redmond O'Neill and Simon Fletcher, also became trusted advisers. When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it. They campaigned on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the rise of <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> British National Party, but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the Anti-Nazi League.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial line formed up on {{a similar}} ridge facing the French position. On the far left, facing Des Thermes, were 300 Florentine light cavalry under Rodolfo Baglioni; {{flanking}} them to the right were 6,000 Italian infantry under Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. In the center were the 7,000 landsknechte {{under the command of}} Eriprando Madruzzo. To their right was d'Avalos himself, together with the small force of about 200 heavy cavalry under Carlo Gonzaga. The Imperial right wing was composed of around 5,000 German and Spanish infantry under Ramón de Cardona; they were flanked, on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right,</b> by 300 Italian light cavalry under Philip de Lannoy, Prince of Sulmona.|$|E

5|$|The Studio {{series was}} {{inspired}} by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand Léger's The Baluster, 1925, which is represented in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> corner. Léger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein is perceived as presenting himself as Matisse's peer {{and in so doing}} repositions pop art as a historical style rather than a contemporary one.|$|E

Rather than general representative types, they are portraits of specific unidentified individuals, according to Shirley Blum.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} then {{arranged for}} the body to be hidden at a Capuchin monastery {{in the small town}} of Cerro Maggiore where it remained for the next eleven years. The whereabouts of the body was kept a secret, even from Mussolini's family. This remained the position until May 1957, when the newly appointed Prime Minister, Adone Zoli, agreed to Mussolini's re-interment at his place of birth in Predappio in Romagna. Zoli was reliant on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> (including Leccisi himself, who was now a neo-fascist party deputy) to support him in Parliament. He also came from Predappio and knew Mussolini's widow, Rachele, well.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{control scheme}} uses a two-way {{joystick}} and five buttons. Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously.

The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids, with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} groups that lacked {{representation in the}} Underground State included the communist (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military arm, the Gwardia Ludowa), and <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves {{in opposition to the}} Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government.|$|E
5|$|This {{change was}} not welcomed {{by many people}} in Germany, who saw this new flag {{as a symbol of}} humiliation {{following}} Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>right</b> were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (see Colour above). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.|$|E
