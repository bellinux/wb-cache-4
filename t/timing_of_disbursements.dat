The second is assigned to the parents earlier on, when the cohort {{is still in its}} childhood. The latter subsidy affects cognitive skills accumulation and in turn educational choices. Our results suggest that a direct grant {{in the form of a}} tuition subsidy might be more efficient even in the absence of short term ?nancial constraints. Although cognitive skills accumulated during childhood play a key role in the educational decisions, an unconditional ?nancial subsidy to parents is not the best policy. The results do not call a halt to investments in cognitive skill accumulation during childhood, but recommend that such investments should be well structured and ensure a high return. educational decisions; dynamic structural estimation; tuition subsidy; parental income subsidy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{accurate}} {{forecast of}} global demand {{is essential to}} stabilize the market for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and to ensure access to high-quality, life-saving medications at the lowest sustainable prices by avoiding underproduction and excessive overproduction, each of which can have negative consequences for the availability of affordable drugs. A robust forecast requires {{an understanding of the}} resources available to support procurement of these relatively expensive antimalarials, in particular from the Global Fund, at present the single largest source of ACT funding. Methods Predictive regression models estimating the <b>timing</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>disbursements</b> from the Global Fund to recipient countries for each malaria grant were derived using a repeated split-sample procedure intended to avoid over-fitting. Predictions were compared against actual disbursements in a group of validation grants, and forecasts of ACT procurement extrapolated from disbursement predictions were evaluated against actual procurement in two sub-Saharan countries. Results Quarterly forecasts were correlated highly with actual smoothed disbursement rates (r = 0. 987, p Conclusion This analysis derived predictive regression models that successfully forecasted disbursement patterning for individual Global Fund malaria grants. These results indicate the utility of this approach for demand forecasting of ACT and, potentially, for other commodities procured using funding from the Global Fund. Further validation using data from other countries in different regions and environments will be necessary to confirm its generalizability. </p...|$|R

40|$|Finding {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} moral hazard is difficult because measures of 2 ̆ 7 unwillingness 2 ̆ 7 are not readily available. For this reason, many theoretical models born out of Information Theory remain untested. In this dissertation I develop two theoretical models and derive empirical tests for the presence of a specific form of moral hazard in credit transactions: diversion of borrowed funds. In the first model, I assess a household 2 ̆ 7 s demographic structure as a source of this specific risk, while in the second model, I explore the possibility that lenders schedule the release of funds to farmers to avoid default risks due to capital diversion. Summaries of these models and test results are included below. ^ Model I. While the fungibility of funds has been recognized as a problem facing agricultural credit programs, {{it is not clear how}} or where funds are diverted by borrowers. Household composition is likely to be an important determinant of the allocation of resources between consumption and production. In particular, given equal resources, households who have to support many dependents relative to others may be more likely to divert funds toward consumption. Evidence from rural South India supports the hypothesis that household composition is one of the determinants of equilibrium input demand, and farmer output. Accordingly, moneylenders consider both wealth and household composition when deciding on the size of loans to offer households. ^ Model II. The existing literature on informal rural credit ignores the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> loan <b>disbursements</b> as a choice variable in lenders 2 ̆ 7 decisions. This model introduces delayed disbursement as an alternative mechanism lenders use to cope with the most likely type of information asymmetry faced by rural lenders: moral hazard. A model is introduced in which a lender-faced with a limited liability constraint and moral hazard [...] must schedule the <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> loans to (a) avoid willful default, and (b) obtain the necessary current production information to assess the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to repay. Empirical findings based on data from South India confirm the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions that poor farmers with a bad credit history are the most likely targets of delay. ...|$|R

40|$|We use a new panel dataset {{of credit}} card {{accounts}} to analyze how consumers responded to the 2001 federal income tax rebates. We estimate the monthly response {{of credit card}} payments, spending, and debt, exploiting the unique, randomized <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the rebate <b>disbursement.</b> We find that on average consumers initially saved some of the rebate, by increasing their credit card payments and thereby paying down debt. But soon afterwards spending increased, counter to the canonical Permanent-Income model. For people whose most intensively used credit card account is in the sample, spending on that account rose by over $ 200 cumulatively over the nine months after rebate receipt, which represents over 40 % of the average household rebate. Because these results relied exclusively on exogenous, randomized variation, they represent compelling evidence of a causal link from the rebate to spending. Further, we found significant heterogeneity in {{the response to the}} rebate across different types of consumers. Notably, spending rose most for consumers who were initially most likely to be liquidity constrained according to various criteria, for example consumers who appeared to be initially constrained by their credit limits (before making additional payments). By contrast, debt declined most (so saving rose most) for unconstrained consumers. These results suggest that liquidity constraints are important. More generally, we found that there can be important dynamics in consumers' response to 'lumpy' increases in income like tax rebates, working in part through balance sheet (liquidity) mechanisms...|$|R
