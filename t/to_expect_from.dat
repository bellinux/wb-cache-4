5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} rice <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>From</b> 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E
5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{entered the}} 20002001 college {{football}} season after a 66 season in 1999 under first-year head coach Tommy Bowden. Fans and college football analysts predicted Bowden would continue Clemson's resurgence from a 38 season {{during the year}} before Bowden was hired. Some pointed to Bowden's undefeated season {{in the second year}} after assuming the head coaching job at Tulane University as a sign of what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> Clemson. Most analysts, however, anticipated a more moderate improvement over the previous year. In the annual preseason poll of media who covered Atlantic Coast Conference football, Clemson tied for second with Georgia Tech. Both teams were far behind perennial favorite Florida State, however. Nationally, Clemson debuted at No. 17 in the preseason AP Poll and No. 20 in the preseason coaches' poll.|$|E

25|$|Conclusively, {{affective and}} {{cognitive}} emotions and responses both {{play a key}} role in the first stage of infidelity. Whether it is jealousy, feeling of incompetence that leads to resentment, or anger they all can take on both forms of emotions and help to drive the emotional reactions towards infidelity. The affective states of partners determine how they react to secrets or feelings they have not learned <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> one another which later transforms into cognitive responses as the significant others begin to anticipate the actions and feelings of themselves and their partners.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{highlighted}} is the mansa’s betrayal by Hammad Amina, {{the chief of the}} Fulbe at Masina. Previously, Amina had promised support in taking Jenné, but went over to the Moroccans with whom he already had a king-vassal type relationship. He advised the Moroccans on what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the Mandinka-Bamana force and kept his own forces from joining the battle. The Fulbe are not mentioned as lending military aid to Jenné’s defenders, but their absence from the battlefield may have had a great effect on the final outcome. The pashalik of Timbuktu would also regret putting faith in Hammad Amina. The Fulbe would eventually thrown off their nominal vassalage to the pashalik and hand the Moroccans their first major defeat in the Sahel.|$|E
25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the situation with the support of Fulbe and Bambara chiefs. In 1599, the mansa led this army in a march on Battle of Jenné. The rulers of Jenné called on the Moroccan garrison of Arma in Timbuktu for reinforcements. The other obstacle to the mansa's success was his betrayal by a major ally prior to the battle. The reasoning behind this betrayal, according to Mandinka oral traditions was that Mahmud IV did not have the support of Mali's traditional generals, the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma. This major ally of the mansa abandoned him at the last moment and went over to the Moroccans and advised them on what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the mansa's army. Despite their amazement at the size of the mansa's force, the Arma won the battle after a violent bombardment.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E

500|$|Concert {{promoter}} Bill Graham billed {{the performances}} as [...] "Jimi Hendrix: A Band of Gypsys", but Hendrix's new direction since {{the breakup of}} the Experience six months earlier had not been publicized. With a new lineup and material, Cox observed, [...] "We didn't know what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the audience and the audience didn't know what <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> us". A total of 47 songs were performed and recorded; since most were played in more than one show, the number of different songs was 24. [...] The group did not prepare set lists or otherwise plan for their performances. [...] McDermott notes, [...] "Hendrix called out tunes to Miles and Cox and would often make time and tempo changes on the fly, alerting his partners with a simple head nod or raising of his guitar neck". [...] Miles also saw improvisation as a key element of their approach. [...] According to Shadwick, the first show was essentially a warm-up set and they performed eleven new songs (it was the only show not to include any familiar Experience numbers). There were some microphone problems during the first two songs, which re-appeared for the first two songs of the second show as well. Hendrix also experienced tuning problems with his guitar. [...] His heavy use of the Stratocaster's vibrato arm or [...] "whammy bar" [...] stressed the strings and led to pitch problems, which he was often forced to correct mid-song. [...] For the second show, in addition to new songs, Hendrix added [...] "Stone Free", [...] "Foxy Lady", [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", and [...] "Purple Haze" [...] to ring in the new decade.|$|E

Chuck Taylor from Billboard called it disappointing, and felt it was bland and lacked innovation.
