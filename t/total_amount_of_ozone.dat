The effect <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> {{on the surface}} UV radiation has been explored {{many times in the}} previous studies due to the decrease <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> layer.

The results showed that the comparison for ozone was good with r (2) of 0. 92. For aerosol, there was difference between satellite measurements and surface measurements due to the insufficient information on aerosol in the retrieval algorithm. The r (2) for surface erythemal UV radiation was high (similar to 0. 94) but satellite measurements showed about 30 % larger values than surface measurements on average by not considering the effect of absorbing aerosols in the retrieval process from satellite measurements. Radiative amplification factor (RAF) is used to access the effect <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and aerosol quantitatively. RAF for ozone was 0. 97 similar to 1. 49 with solar zenith angle.

We have then used their overlap with the Nimbus 7 and EP TOMS instruments to establish the relative calibration of the various instruments. We have evaluated the drift uncertainty in our merged ozone data (MOD) set by examining both the individual instrument drift uncertainty and the uncertainty in establishing the instrument- to-instrument differences. We conclude that the instrumental drift uncertainty over the 22 -year data record is 0. 9 %/decade (2 -sigma). We have compared our MOD record with 37 ground stations that have a continuous record over that time period. We have a mean drift {{with respect to the}} stations of + 0. 3 %/decade which is within 1 -sigma of our uncertainty estimate. Using the satellite record as a transfer standard, we can estimate the capability of the ground instruments to establish satellite calibration. Adding the statistical variability of the station drifts with respect to the satellite to an estimate of the overall drift uncertainty of the world standard instrument, we conclude that the stations should be able to be used to establish the drift of the satellite data record to within and uncertainty of 0. 6 %/decade (2 -sigma). Adding to this an uncertainty due to the-incomplete global coverage of the stations, we conclude that the station data should be able to establish the global trend with an uncertainty of about 0. 7 %/decade, slightly better than for the satellite record. We conclude that merging the two records together gives only a slight improvement in the uncertainty. Keeping them separate gives the greater confidence of two independent measures <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> trend and potential recovery. We fit the trend in our MOD record through May of 1991 and then extrapolated forward to see if the data {{at the end of the}} record was above the statistical model as a measure <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery as was done in the last WMO/UNEP assessment report. Because our data set drifts with respect to the ground-stations through May of 1991, we calculated a smaller global trend (- 1. 1 %/decade) than in the WMO/UNEP report. Our data in 1998 and 1999 was, on average 2 DU above the extrapolated statistical model with a 2 -sigma uncertainty of 6 DU. For the combined mid-latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres, the data was 5 DU above the extrapolated statistical model with a 2 -sigma uncertainty of 10 DU. These may be signs of recovery, but they are still statistically insignificant...|$|R
