40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} interaction between the basic rules for tense interpretation, on the one hand, and temporal types of VPs or sentences, time expressions and syntactic distribution of tense forms, on the other. This dissertation proposes an analysis in which each tense form is associated with at least three <b>time</b> identities, the <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> the event time and the reference <b>time.</b> The <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> is defined as the time from which a situation is considered and interpreted, the event time as the time at which a situation takes place and the reference time is the time at which the situation holds and {{which is part of the}} event time under consideration. Concerning the temporal structures of situations expressed by VPs or sentences, this dissertation proposes a six-type temporal classification and treats temporal types not as atomic but as reducible to temporal features. By so doing, this dissertation brings to light the internal structure among various temporal types. Regarding the relation between tense and time expressions, this dissertation analyzes it to be one of temporal inclusion and provides a successful account of why time adverbs do not necessarily mark both ending points of a given homogeneous situation, though this is true with a nonhomogeneous situation. In accounting for tense interpretation in complement clauses, this dissertation maintains that complement tense forms and matrix tense forms can be interpreted in the same way and they differ only in the interpretation of the <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> <b>point.</b> In the matrix clause, tense is interpreted with respect to the speech time and, in the complement clause, tense is interpreted relative to the reference time of the matrix clause. Because the <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> is used instead of the speech time in the proposed basic tense rules, these rules are general and powerful enough to be applicable to tenses in any syntactic environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{curvature}} {{effect may}} be responsible for the steep decay phase observed in gamma-ray bursts. For testing the curvature effect with observations, the <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> <b>point</b> t_ 0 adopted to plot observer time and flux on a logarithmic scale should be appropriately selected. In practice, however, the true t_ 0 cannot be directly constrained from the data. Then, we move t_ 0 to a certain time in the steep decay phase, which can be easily identified. In this situation, we derive an analytical formula to describe the flux evolution of the steep decay phase. The analytical formula is read as F_ν∝ (1 +t̃_ obs/t̃_c) ^-α with α(t̃_ obs) = 2 +∫_ 0 ^ (1 +t̃_ obs/t̃_c) β(τ) d[(1 +τ/t̃_c) ]/ (1 + t̃_ obs/t̃_c), where F_ν is the flux observed at frequency ν, t̃_ obs is the observer <b>time</b> by setting <b>zero</b> <b>time</b> <b>point</b> t_ 0 at a certain time in the steep decay phase, β is the spectral index estimated around ν, and t̃_c is the decay timescale of the phase with t̃_ obs≥ 0.

It is found that the analytical formula presents a well estimation about the evolution of flux shaped by the curvature effect. Our analytical formula can be used to confront the curvature effect with observations and estimate the decay timescale of the steep decay phase.

40|$|The rate {{limiting}} step in RISC-mediated cleavage occurs before catalysis To analyze a potential influence on target RNA structures on RISC-mediated cleavage {{it is important to}} know which is the rate-limiting step in RISC-mediated target cleavage. We envisioned two possibilities: The recognition of the target site and therefore base pairing between the siRNA and the target site might occur very fast whereas catalysis of cleavage could be unfavourable and therefore might require some time. Alternatively. association of RISC with the target, required for cleavage to occur, might be rate-limiting and is followed by rapid catalysis. To analyze this we made use of the fact that RISC is a Mg 2 + dependent endonuclease (Schwarz et al., 2004). RISC was inactivated by addition of EDTA to complex Mg 2 +, which results in loss of cleavage as determined under single turnover conditions (data not shown). Restoring 5 mM Mg 2 + at <b>time</b> <b>point</b> <b>zero</b> led to rescue of RISC-mediated cleavage (Figure S 2). When Mg 2 + was added only after 35 min, a burst in target cleavage could be observed, which led to the rapid accumulation of cleaved target up to levels when Mg 2 + was added at <b>time</b> <b>point</b> <b>zero.</b> This indicates that the {{rate limiting}} step in RISC-mediated cleavage is not catalysis itself, but rather the association of RISC to its target, which occurs independently of the presence of Mg 2 +. Therefore any changes in cleavage rates that are not caused by target site accessibility are a result of an accelerated formation of a cleavage competent siRNA-target RNA interaction. 1 Supplemental Experimental Procedure...|$|R

50|$|The Earth {{revolves}} around the Sun. As seen from Earth, the Sun appears to revolve once around the Earth through the background stars in one year. If the Earth orbited the Sun with a constant speed, in a circular orbit in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis, then the Sun would culminate every day {{at exactly the same}} time, and be a perfect time keeper (except for the very small effect of the slowing rotation of the Earth). But the orbit of the Earth is an ellipse not centered on the Sun, and its speed varies between 30.287 and 29.291 km/s, according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and its angular speed also varies, and thus the Sun appears to move faster (relative to the background stars) at perihelion (currently around 3 January) and slower at aphelion a half year later. At these extreme points this effect varies the apparent solar day by 7.9 s/day from its mean. Consequently, the smaller daily differences on other days in speed are cumulative until these points, reflecting how the planet accelerates and decelerates compared to the mean. As a result, the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit contributes a sine wave variation with an amplitude of 7.66 min and a period of one year to the equation of <b>time.</b> The <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> are reached at perihelion (at the beginning of January) and aphelion (beginning of July); the extreme values are in early April (negative) and early October (positive).|$|R

Little is known, however, {{about the impact of}} preanalytical factors, for example, delayed times to tissue fixation, on global phosphoprotein levels in tissues. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the potential effects of delayed tissue preservation (cold ischemia) on the levels of phosphoproteins using targeted and nontargeted proteomic approaches. Rat and murine liver samples were exposed to different cold ischemic conditions ranging from 10 to 360 min prior to cryopreservation. The phosphoproteome was analyzed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology and phosphoprotein-enriched quantitative tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RPPA analysis of rat liver tissues with long (up to 360 min) cold ischemia times did not reveal statistically significant alterations of specific phosphoproteins even though nonphosphorylated cytokeratin 18 (CK 18) showed increased levels after 360 min of delay to freezing. Keeping the samples on ice prior to cryopreservation prevented this effect. LC-MS/MS-based quantification of 1684 phosphorylation sites in rat liver tissues showed broadening of their distribution compared to <b>time</b> <b>point</b> <b>zero,</b> but without reaching statistical significance for individual phosphosites. Similarly, RPPA analysis of mouse liver tissues with short (< 60 min) cold ischemia times did not reveal directed or predictable changes of protein and phosphoprotein levels. Using LC-MS/MS and quantification of 791 phosphorylation sites, we found that the distribution of ratios compared to <b>time</b> <b>point</b> <b>zero</b> broadens with prolonged ischemia times, but these were rather undirected and diffuse changes, as we could not detect significant alterations of individual phosphosites. On the basis of our results from RPPA and LC-MS/MS analysis of rat and mouse liver tissues, we conclude that prolonged cold ischemia results in unspecific phosphoproteome changes that can be neither predicted nor assigned to individual proteins. On the other hand, we identified a number of phosphosites which were extraordinarily stable even after 360 min of cold ischemia and, therefore, may be used as general reference markers for future companion diagnostics for kinase inhibitors...|$|R
