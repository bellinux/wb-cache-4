40|$|It is {{generally}} {{thought that the}} light coming from <b>the</b> inner <b>plunging</b> region of black hole accretion discs contributes negligibly to the disc's overall spectrum, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> fluid is swallowed by the black hole before it has time to radiate. In the standard disc model used to fit X-ray observations of accretion discs, <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region {{is assumed to be}} perfectly dark. However, numerical simulations that include the full physics of the magnetized flow predict that {{a small fraction of the}} disc's total luminosity emanates from <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region. We investigate the observational consequences of this neglected inner light. We compute radiative transfer based disc spectra that correspond to 3 D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulated discs (which produce light inside their <b>plunging</b> regions). In <b>the</b> context of black hole spin estimation, we find that the neglected inner light only has a modest effect (this bias is less than typical observational systematic errors). For rapidly spinning black holes, we find that the combined emission from <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region produces a weak power-law tail at high energies. This indicates that infalling matter is the origin for some of the `coronal' emission observed in the thermal dominant and steep power-law states of X-ray binaries.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of magnetic fields frozen to a perfectly conducting plasma fluid around a Kerr black hole is investigated. We focus on <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region between <b>the</b> black hole horizon and the marginally stable circular orbit in the equatorial plane. Adopting the kinematic approximation where the dynamical effects of magnetic fields are ignored, we exactly solve Maxwell's equations with the assumptions that the geodesic {{motion of the}} fluid is stationary and axisymmetric, the magnetic field has only radial and azimuthal components and depends only on time and radial coordinates. We show that the stationary state of the magnetic field in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions at the marginally stable circular orbit. If the magnetic field at the marginally stable circular orbit is in a stationary state, the magnetic field in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region will quickly settle into a stationary state {{if it is not}} so initially, in a time determined by the dynamical time scale. The radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable circular orbit {{is more important than the}} toroidal component in determining the structure and {{evolution of}} the magnetic field in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region. Even if at the marginally stable circular orbit the toroidal component is zero, in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region a toroidal component is quickly generated from the radial component by the shear motion of the fluid. Finally, we show that the dynamical effects of magnetic fields are unimportant in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region if they are negligible on the marginally stable circular orbit. This supports the ``no-torque inner boundary condition'' of thin disks, contrary to the claim in the recent literature.

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, <b>the</b> <b>plunge</b> of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plunge</b> depth {{is defined}} as the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. <b>The</b> <b>plunge</b> depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce <b>the</b> <b>plunge</b> depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

40|$|Free surface disruption, bubble entrainment, and {{resulting}} bubbly wake {{due to a}} stationary and moving horizontal jets plunging into a quiescent liquid were studied both numerically and experimentally. The moving jet wake showed significantly different flow characteristics than the stationary jet wake. High speed videos revealed that large vortical structures with entrapped air were generated periodically from <b>the</b> horizontal <b>plunging</b> jet.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{presence}} of torques at the inner edges of geometrically-thin black hole accretion disks using 3 -dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in a pseudo-Newtonian potential. By varying the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability that leads to angular momentum transport, we show that the dynamics of gas inside the radius of marginal stability varies depending upon the magnetic field strength just outside that radius. Weak fields are unable to causally connect material within <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region to <b>the</b> rest of the disk, and zero torque is an approximately correct boundary condition at the radius of marginal stability. Stronger fields, which we obtain artificially but which may occur physically within more complete disk models, are able to couple at least some parts of <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region to <b>the</b> rest of the disk. In this case, angular momentum (and implicitly energy) is extracted from the material in <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region. Furthermore, <b>the</b> magnetic coupling to <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> region can be highly time dependent with large fluctuations in the torque at the radius of marginal stability. This implies varying accretion efficiencies, both across systems and within a given system at different times. The results suggest a possible link between changes in X-ray and outflow activity, with both being driven by transitions between weak and strong field states. Comment: 4 pages, 4 postscript figures.
