The livery consisted of a green coat and drab knee breeches, together with the silver badge of the Corporation worn upon the right arm. Its cost was borne by the Corporation at the cost of 13s. 4d. per annum. In nearby Alnwick, the Waits were entitled to collect an annual fee from each house, amounting to more than £30. In Morpeth, a similar arrangement may have operated, but two annual payments of 2s.6d. were made to the Waits directly by the Corporation, as well as occasional payments. When Morpeth had advertised the vacant post in 1744, the advertisement commented 'It is a place of considerable profit'. Lamshaw may have held the post until his death, for the record of his burial names him as one of the Waits.|$|R
50|$|In 1720, a new {{building}} was constructed on the site which in that day was still surrounded by fields. The town only continued {{as far north as}} Accisevej/Allegade. <b>Town</b> <b>musician</b> S. J.F.Krebs, who owned it from 1742, ran an illigit inn in the building. In 1759, after a renovation of the buildings, he obtained a royal license to operate a mail and coaching inn. It was given the name Norske Løve after one of the naval ships that participated in the Battle of Køge Bay on 1 July 1767. It was commanded by Niels Juel, had a crew of 568 men and was equipped with 86 canons. After S. J.F.Krebs' death, his widow married a chemist named Carl Hansen. Norske Løve developed into a popular excursion destination for people in Køge. The large garden, with fishing pond, music pavilion and an estrade for dancing, was often frequented by travelling fun fairs in the summer time. When the equestrian statue of Frederik VII was unveiled in 1862, Norske Løve hosted a dinner with 800 guests.|$|R
