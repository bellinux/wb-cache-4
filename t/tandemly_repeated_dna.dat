5000|$|Multiple loci VNTR {{analysis}} (MLVA) is {{a method}} employed for the genetic analysis of particular microorganisms, such as pathogenic bacteria, that {{takes advantage of the}} polymorphism of <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences. A [...] "VNTR" [...] is a [...] "variable-number tandem repeat". This method is well known in forensic science since it is the basis of DNA fingerprinting in humans. When applied to bacteria, it contributes to forensic microbiology through which the source of a particular strain might eventually be traced back, making it a useful technique for outbreak surveillance. In a typical MLVA, a number of well-selected and characterised (in terms of mutation rate and diversity) loci are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), so that the size of each locus can be measured, usually by electrophoresis of the amplification products together with reference DNA fragments (a so-called DNA size marker). Different electrophoresis equipment can be used depending on the required size estimate accuracy, and the local laboratory set-up, from basic agarose gel electrophoresis up to the more sophisticated and high-throughput capillary electrophoresis devices. From this size estimate, the number of repeat units at each locus can be deduced. The resulting information is a code which can be easily compared to reference databases once the assay has been harmonised and standardised. MLVA has become a major first line typing tool in a number of pathogens where such an harmonisation could be achieved, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, Brucella.|$|E
40|$|Several {{monomers}} (177 bp) of a tandemly arranged repetitive nuclear DNA {{sequence of}} Brassica oleracea have been cloned and sequenced. They share up to 95 % homology between {{one another and}} up to 80 % with other satellite DNA sequences of Cruciferae, suggesting a common ancestor. Both strands of these monomers show more than 50 % homology with many tRNA genes; the best homologies have been obtained with Lys and His yeast mitochondrial tRNA genes (respectively 64 % and 60 %). These results suggest that small <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences of plants may have evolved from a tRNA gene ancestor. These tandem repeats have probably arisen via a process involving reverse transcription of polymerase III RNA intermediates, {{as is the case}} for interspersed DNA sequences of mammalians.

40|$|<b>Tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> can {{comprise}} several {{percent of}} total genomic DNA in complex organisms and, in some instances, {{may play a role}} in chromosome structure or function. Alpha satellite DNA is the major family of <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> found at the centromeres of all human and primate chromosomes. Each centromere is characterized by a large contiguous array of up to several thousand kb which can contain several thousand highly homogeneous repeat units. By using a novel application of the polymerase chain reaction (repPCR), we are able to amplify a representative sampling of multiple repetitive units simultaneously, allowing rapid analysis of chromosomal subsets. Direct sequence analysis of repPCR amplified alpha satellite from chromosomes 17 and X reveals positions of sequence heterogeneity as two bands at a single nucleotide position on a sequencing ladder. The use of TdT in the sequencing reactions greatly reduces the background associated with polymerase pauses and stops, allowing visualization of heterogeneous bases found in as little as 10 % of the repeat units. Confirmation of these heterogeneous positions was obtained by comparison to the sequence of multiple individual cloned copies obtained both by PCR and non-PCR based methods. PCR amplification of alpha satellite can also reveal multiple repeat units which differ in size. Analysis of repPCR products from chromosome 17 and X allows rapid determination of the molecular basis of these repeat unit length variants, which appear to be a result of unequal crossing-over. The application of repPCR to the study of <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> should allow in-depth analysis of intra- and interchromosomal variation and unequal crossing-over, thus providing insight into the biology and genetics of these large families of DNA...|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{stability}} of <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNAs</b> {{is affected by}} repeat sequence, tract length, tract purity, and replication direction. Alterations in DNA methylation status are thought to influence many processes of mutagenesis. By use of bacterial and primate cell systems, we have determined the effect of CpG methylation on the {{genetic stability}} of cloned di-, tri-, penta- and minisatellite <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences. Depending on the repeat sequence, methylation can significantly enhance or reduce its genetic stability. This effect was evident when repeat tracts were replicated from either direction. Unexpectedly, methylation of adjacent sequences altered the stability of contiguous repeat sequences void of methylatable sites. Of the seven repeat sequences investigated, methylation stabilized five, destabilized one, and {{had no effect on}} another. Thus, although methylation generally stabilized repeat tracts, its influence depended on the sequence of the repeat. The current results lend support to the notion that the biological consequences of CpG methylation may be affected through local alterations of DNA structure as well as through direct protein–DNA interactions. In vivo CpG methylation in bacteria may have technical applications for the isolation and stable propagation of DNA sequences that have been recalcitrant to isolation and/or analyses because of their extreme instability...|$|R

Alpha satellite DNA is a noncoding <b>tandemly</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>DNA</b> family found at the centromeres of all human and primate chromosomes. We have used sequence analysis to investigate the molecular basis of 13 variant alpha satellite repeat units, allowing comparison of multiple independent recombination events in closely related DNA sequences. The distribution of these events within the 171 -bp monomer is nonrandom and clusters in a distinct 20 - to 25 -bp region, suggesting possible effects of primary sequence and/or chromatin structure. The position of these recombination events may be associated with the location within the higher-order repeat unit of the binding site for the centromere-specific protein CENP-B.

These repeats contribute differently {{to the global}} features of these genomes, and we explore the evolutionary implications of these differences by empirical examination of length polymorphisms at 20 long triplet-repeats repeats in S. cerevisiae, and by comparison of observed and expected repeat distributions. All of a sample of 20 microsatellites found in S. cerevisiae are highly polymorphic in length, suggesting that mutation pressure overcomes overall selection for small genome size that will tend to shorten or eliminate unnecessary DNA. By comparison, prokaryotes have fewer long repeats than expected, {{except for a few}} statistically improbable repeats that appear to function in gene regulation. Finally, we find that in all these genomes there is an excess of repeats shorter than those traditionally considered to be microsatellites. This finding suggests that even in prokaryotes these repeats are being generated by mutational pressures.

However, the mechanisms for generation and evolution for these sequences are largely unknown because of the uncertain origins of the satellite DNAs. We found highly divergent genus-specific satellite DNAs that showed sequence similarity with genus-specific intergenic spacers (IGSs) in the family Solanaceae, which includes the genera Nicotiana, Solanum and Capsicum. The conserved position of the IGS between 25 S and 18 S rDNA facilitates comparison of IGS sequences across genera, even {{in the presence of}} very low sequence similarity. Sequence comparison of IGS may elucidate the procedure of the genesis of complex monomer units of the satellite DNAs. Within the IGS of Capsicum species, base substitutions and copy number variation of subrepeat monomers were causes of monomer divergence in IGS sequences. At the level of inter-generic IGS sequences of the family Solanaceae, however, genus-specific motif selection, motif shuffling between subrepeats and differential amplification among motifs were involved in formation of genus-specific IGS. Therefore, the genus-specific satellite DNAs in Solanaceae plants can be generated from differentially organized repeat monomers of the IGS rather than by accumulation of mutations from pre-existent satellite DNAs...|$|R
