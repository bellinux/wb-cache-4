5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, have claimed <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he}} has a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E

25|$|However, Olbermann's 2012 breach-of-contract {{lawsuit against}} Current TV {{indicated}} that Olbermann {{had been moved}} to leave MSNBC by Current founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt. The lawsuit alleged <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> and Hyatt had attempted to court Olbermann despite being informed that he had two years remaining on his MSNBC contract, and reached an agreement for him to join the network the same month as his departure from MSNBC, {{according to court documents}} acquired by TMZ.|$|E
25|$|In 1881 and 1882, Gore {{continued}} his hitting success, {{as he finished}} in the top 10 in multiple offensive categories. He led the league in runs scored both seasons, and walks in 1882. On June 25, 1881, he became the first known player to record at least seven stolen bases in one game when the Chicago Tribune noted <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> stole second base five times and third base three times. It considered the all-time record even though at the time stolen bases were not recorded as an official statistic. This feat has only equaled by Billy Hamilton, who also stole seven bases on August 31, 1894.|$|E
25|$|The early call of Florida for Gore {{has been}} {{alleged to have}} cost Bush several close states, {{including}} Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin. In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> had won the election, {{it is possible that}} it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them. Had Bush carried all four of these states, he {{would have been able to}} win the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may have affected the outcome of the Senate election in Washington state, where incumbent Republican Slade Gorton was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes statewide.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of Gore's {{allegedly}} erroneous scientific statements tend {{to focus}} on a British High Court's ruling <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> Inconvenient Truth documentary was deemed by the court to have nine significant errors.|$|R
2500|$|Gore {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{criticism}} for his personal use of energy, including his use of private jets and ownership of multiple very large homes. The Tennessee Center for Policy Research (TCPR) has twice criticized Gore for electricity consumption in his Tennessee home. In February 2007, TCPR stated that its analysis of records from the Nashville Electric Service indicated <b>that</b> the <b>Gore</b> household uses [...] "20 times as much electricity as the average household nationwide." [...] In reporting on TCPR's claims, MSNBC's Countdown With Keith Olbermann noted that the house has twenty rooms and home offices and that the [...] "green power switch" [...] installed increased their electric bill while decreasing overall carbon pollution. Philosopher A. C. Grayling also defended Al <b>Gore,</b> arguing <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> personal lifestyle does nothing to impugn his message and <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> critics have committed the ad hominem fallacy.|$|R

500|$|In early June 2010, {{shortly after}} {{purchasing}} a new home, the Gores announced {{in an e-mail}} to friends that after [...] "long and careful consideration", they had made a mutual decision to separate. [...] In May 2012, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> started dating Elizabeth Keadle of California.|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral {{toward all}} of the candidates which led to speculation that he {{would come out of}} a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> waited because {{he did not want to}} repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} film on {{scientific}} and political grounds. Journalist Ronald Bailey argued in the libertarian magazine Reason that although [...] "Gore gets [...] more right than wrong," [...] he exaggerates the risks. MIT atmospheric physicist Richard S. Lindzen was vocally {{critical of the}} film, writing in a June 26, 2006 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> was using a biased presentation to exploit the fears of the public for his own political gain.|$|E

500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|CNN noted that, [...] "in 1988, for {{the first}} time, 12 Southern states would hold their {{primaries}} on the same day, dubbed [...] "Super Tuesday". Gore {{thought he would be}} the only serious Southern contender; he had not counted on Jesse Jackson." [...] Jackson defeated Gore in the South Carolina Primary, winning, [...] "more than half the total vote, three times that of his closest rival here, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee." [...] Gore next placed great hope on Super Tuesday where they split the Southern vote: Jackson winning Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia; Gore winning Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Gore was later endorsed by New York City Mayor Ed Koch who made statements in favor of Israel and against Jackson. These statements cast Gore in a negative light, leading voters away from Gore who received only 10% of the vote in the New York Primary. Gore then dropped out of the race. The New York Times said <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> also lost support due to his attacks against Jackson, Dukakis, and others.|$|E
500|$|Gore was a speculated {{candidate}} for the 2004 Presidential Election (a bumper sticker, [...] "Re-elect Gore in 2004!" [...] was popular). On December 16, 2002, however, Gore {{announced that he would}} not run in 2004. Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running. One observer concluded it was [...] "Al Gore who has the best chance to defeat the incumbent president", noting that [...] "of the 43 Presidents, only three have been direct descendents of former Presidents:" [...] John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. Bush, that [...] "all three won the office only after... anomalies in the Electoral College", that the first two were defeated for re-election in a populist backlash, and finally that [...] "the men who first lost to the presidential progeny and then beat them" [...] (i.e. Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland) [...] "each won a sort of immortalityâ€”having his image placed on a unit of US currency", and <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> should answer this call of history. The draft movement, however, failed to convince Gore to run.|$|E

5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John Quincy Adams wrote <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|R
500|$|In [...] "extensive exit polling" [...] of An Inconvenient Truth in [...] "conservative {{suburban}} markets like Plano and Irvine (Orange County), {{as well as}} Dallas and Long Island", 92 percent rated [...] "Truth" [...] highly and 87 {{percent of}} the respondents said they'd recommend the film to a friend. University of Washington professor Michele Poff argued <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> was successful in communicating to conservative-leaning audiences by framing the climate crisis as apolitical. [...] "Goreâ€™s and the environmentâ€™s identification with the Democratic Party posed a significant challenge to reaching Republicans and conservatives, as well as those disgruntled with politics in general," [...] Poff wrote. [...] "To appeal to such individuals, Gore framed the matter as distinctly apolitical â€” as an issue both outside politics and one that was crucial regardless of oneâ€™s ideological leanings. These explicit attempts to frame the issue as apolitical take on further gravitas when we consider how Gore infused the film with reflections of conservative values. Indeed, Gore reached deeply into the value structure of American conservatives to highlight ideals that suggested his cause was not liberal, but rather was beyond politics, beyond ideology." ...|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth isâ€”and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"â€”the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet toâ€”I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{report in}} The Field stated: [...] "The {{result was a}} more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected.". Third-placed Heathcote said <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> was the best {{player of the year}} and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it. Gore, {{according}} to Heathcote, was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a forceful shot instead of merely a pat back over the net. All the opponents who were defeated by Gore {{on his way to the}} title were real tennis players. His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style, and of the offensive style of the volley player â€“ who comes to the net to force the point, over the baseline player â€“ who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court, intent on keeping the ball in play. His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post â€“ 5ft (1.52 m) in contrast to the modern height of 3ft 6 in (1.07 m) â€“ made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy.|$|E
50|$|Political commentators, however, {{have argued}} <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> refusal to have Clinton {{campaign}} {{with him was}} a bigger liability to Gore than Clinton's scandals. The 2000 US Congressional election also saw the Democrats gain more seats in Congress. As {{a result of this}} gain, control of the US Senate was split 50-50 between both parties, and Democrats would regain control over the US Senate after Republican Senator Jim Jeffords defected from his party in the spring of 2001 and agreed to caucus with the Democrats.|$|R
2500|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{supported}} both views. Before {{and after the}} 2000 election, John Cochran of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called [...] "Clinton fatigue". Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low personal approval ratings through the election, and analysts such as Vanderbilt University's John G. Geer later concluded [...] "Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting {{had a significant impact}} on Gore's chances". Other analysts sided with Clinton's argument, and argued <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 2000, {{projections}} indicated <b>that</b> <b>Gore's</b> opponent, then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, had narrowly won the election. Gore won {{the national}} popular vote but lost the electoral college vote after a bitter legal battle over disputed vote counts {{in the state of}} Florida. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266. One elector pledged to Gore did not cast an electoral vote; Gore received 267 pledged electors. The election {{was one of the most}} controversial in American history.|$|R
500|$|The {{prospect}} of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 {{in light of the}} upcoming 2008 presidential election. Although Gore frequently stated that he had [...] "no plans to run", he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run. This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The director of the film, Davis Guggenheim, stated that after the release of the film, [...] "Everywhere I go with him, they treat him like a rock star." [...] After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars. During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the [...] "greening" [...] of the ceremony itself. Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president. However, background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage, implying that it was a rehearsed gag, which he later acknowledged. After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, speculation increased about a possible presidential run. Gore's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running, he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run. Gore, however, remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{was positive}} about the episode, writing [...] "This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close. Not all of it worked, but enough of it did... that I was left happy." [...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy." [...] Catucci enjoyed Tracy's Cosby dream, while he was anesthetized, calling it [...] "delightful". The A.V. Clubs Steven Hyden enjoyed the episode, writing it was [...] "one of the funniest and most enjoyable episodes of the season." [...] Hyden commented that Liz's plot had [...] "a string of craaazy [...] jokes. But they were amusing to laugh-out-loud jokes." [...] "I wouldn't claim {{that it was an}} absolutely top tier episode [...] but what the hell, it had some pretty great moments", said Sean Gandert for Paste magazine. Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said <b>that</b> <b>Gore</b> [...] "also rarely disappoints", but was not complimentary towards NBC [...] " [...] its green week thing" [...] into [...] "Sun Tea". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that [...] "the best bits" [...] from this episode were [...] "Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate." ...|$|E
