5000|$|The Hoffman had two {{prototype}} vehicles {{built by}} the R.C. Hoffman company of Detroit, Michigan in 1931. They were front-drive vehicles, powered by Lycoming straight-8 engines.

25|$|GNX #001 is the 1986 {{prototype}} currently {{owned by}} Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased traction. The <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.|$|R
50|$|The {{support arm}} carried all the load; the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> carried the {{accelerating}} and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the camber. Advantages claimed {{for the system}} included superior maintenance of wheel alignment from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the caster angle, and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the <b>torque</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{means for}} {{measuring}} torque is {{to mount the}} dynamometer housing {{so that it is}} free to turn except as restrained by a <b>torque</b> <b>arm.</b> The housing can be made free to rotate by using trunnions connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> is connected to the dyno housing and a weighing scale is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> measured {{from the center of the}} dynamometer. A load cell transducer can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an electrical signal that is proportional to torque.|$|R
5000|$|The average [...] {{is around}} 2 MPa (290 psi). If the pump flow is high the extra loss can be considerable. The power loss also {{increases}} if the load pressures vary a lot. The cylinder areas, motor displacements and mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> must {{be designed to}} match load pressure {{in order to bring}} down the power losses. Pump pressure always equals the maximum load pressure when several functions are run simultaneously and the power input to the pump equals the (max. load pressure + ΔpLS) x sum of flow.|$|E

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal wheel control. One or more <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> may be added to provide supplementary wheel control, particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the wheels, improving wheel control on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to control wheel movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|E
40|$|A {{major part}} of {{vibrations}} caused by a car engine is transduced into the driver's cabin via the <b>torque</b> <b>arm,</b> which provides {{a connection between the}} engine and the car body. The <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> supports the engine against rotational movement caused by the angular acceleration of the crank shaft. In a laboratory setup, the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> is placed between a shaker and the car's subframe, fixed on a span. The shaker emulates a controlled engine run-up. An inertial mass actuator based on piezoelectric ceramics is attached to the subframe nearby the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> aiming to reduce the transmitted vibrations. By means of a multi-order adaptive narrowband controller the performance of the inertial mass actuator in reducing vibration induced into the car body is investigated. The system behavior of the test bed is measured and implemented in a hardware-in- The-loop test facility, which is intended for use as a test and development environment for signal processing units with adaptive contro l algorithms for the purpose of active vibration control. The developed hardware-in- The-loop test facility is subjected to a functional test, by comparing its controllability with the one of the real test bed.

5000|$|Systems {{which require}} the torque {{of the system}} under test to be {{measured}} typically use a strain gauge mounted on a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> that {{is attached to the}} housing perpendicular to the input shaft. The housing/stator is mounted on roller bearings and the rotor is mounted on roller bearings within the housing/stator so that it can turn independently of the rotor and frame. The strain gauge connects the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> to the frame assembly and keeps the housing from spinning as housing tries to turn in the same direction of the turbine.

5000|$|The {{original}} milestone 1941 Clipper {{rode the}} senior wheelbase of 127 in {{and used the}} One Twenty's [...] straight eight, but produced 125 bhp (five more than the One Twenty). Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> A double-link connection between the Pitman arm and steering brackets, with a cross bar and idler arm and two cross tubes, controlled wheel movement.|$|E
5000|$|A new tower began {{construction}} {{at the end}} of July 2008 and was completed on August 14, 2008 by Eli the Construction Guy (structural engineer). The station returned to full power (50,000 Watts) on September 25, 2008 at 17:00 PT. The new tower has a 50 ft top-loading [...] "capacitance hat", which electrically extends the tower's height another seventy-five feet, effectively, without actually needing more tower sections (the local regulation authorities in apparent defiance of electrical engineering principles, and communications law, demanded [...] "a 10 percent reduction in overall height", otherwise the necessary permits would be refused, not withstanding the federal government's primary authority over radio communications, and KFI's strategic role as an Emergency Alert System station for the western U.S. region). The new tower is also equipped with high intensity strobe lights due to its proximity to the Fullerton Municipal Airport, and additional safety upgrades because of the previous plane crash. The new tower has <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> which limit the twisting of the tower in high winds. The tower has been dedicated to the memory of John Paoli, KFI Chief Engineer from 2000 to 2008, who died suddenly from a previously unknown genetic heart condition soon after overseeing the construction of the new tower. A plaque bearing the words [...] "John A. Paoli, 1958-2008, Memorial Tower.

40|$|Shaft-mounted {{gearboxes}} {{are widely}} used in industry. The torque arm that holds the reactive torque on the housing of the gearbox, if properly positioned creates the reactive force that lifts the gearbox and unloads the bearings of the output shaft. The shortcoming of these <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> {{is that if the}} gearbox is reversed the direction of the reactive force on the torque arm changes to opposite and added to the weight of the gearbox overloads the bearings shortening their operating life. In this paper, a new patented design of <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> that develop a controlled lifting force and counteract the weight of the gearbox regardless of the direction of the output shaft rotation is described. Several mathematical models of the conventional and new <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> were developed and verified experimentally on a specially built test rig that enables modelling of the radial compliance of the gearbox bearings and elastic elements of the <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> Comparison showed a good agreement between theoretical and experimental results...|$|E
50|$|The Honda RC30 had a 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' {{that linked}} the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a linkage through the swingarm, {{reducing}} rear wheel hop under braking.

40|$|Vibrational energy {{harvesters}} (VEH) are one way {{to generate}} electricity. Though the energy quantities are not enough to run desktop computers, they can power remote devices such as temperature, pressure, and accelerometer sensors or power biological implants. New versions of the Bluetooth protocol can even be used with VEH technology to send wireless data. An important aspect of VEH devices is the power output, operating frequency, and bandwidth. This dissertation investigates a novel method of actuating the primary buckled energy harvesting structure using <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> as a force amplification mechanism. Buckled structures can exhibit snap-through and {{has the potential to}} broaden the operating frequency for the VEH. Macro and MEMS size prototypes are fabricated and evaluated via a custom made shaker table. The effect of compliance arms, which pin the center beam with piezoelectric strips, are also evaluated along with damping ratios. ANSYS models evaluating generated power are created for use in future optimization studies. Lastly, high energy orbitals (HEO) are observed in the devices. Results show that buckling lowers and broadens the output power of the new devices. Reverse sweeps drastically increase the operating frequency during snap-through. Rectangular compliance arms made of poly-lactic acid (PLA) generated the most power of all compliance arms tested. HEO performance can be induced by perturbing the system while maintaining the same input force which increases power output...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} detailed descriptions, modeling {{parameters and}} technical data of a 5 MW high-speed gearbox {{developed for the}} National Renewable Energy Laboratory offshore 5 MW baseline wind turbine. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to support the concept studies and research for large offshore wind turbines by providing a baseline gearbox model with detailed modeling parameters. This baseline gearbox follows the most conventional design types of those used in wind turbines. It is based on the four-point supports: two main bearings and two <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> The gearbox consists of three stages: two planetary and one parallel stage gears. The gear ratios among the stages are calculated in a way to obtain the minimum gearbox weight. The gearbox components are designed and selected based on the offshore wind turbine design codes and validated by comparison to the data available from large offshore wind turbine prototypes. All parameters required to establish the dynamic model of the gearbox are then provided. Moreover, a maintenance map indicating components with high to low probability of failure is shown. The 5 MW reference gearbox can be used as a baseline for research on wind turbine gearboxes and comparison studies. It can also be employed in global analysis tools to represent a more realistic model of a gearbox in a coupled analysi...|$|E
40|$|Since 2004, {{a team of}} {{students}} and researchers of University of Liege takes part to the Shell Eco Marathon race with a lightweight electric vehicle. The goal of this pedagogical project is to design, fabricate and operate a vehicle exhibiting the least energy consumption. A key factor to reduce the energy consumption is to minimize the vehicle mass. Besides the body structure made of CRFP, engineers have also {{to focus on the}} weight reduction of any mechanical parts of the powertrain, transmission and of rolling gear. The combination of topology optimization with additive manufacturing techniques allows to propose innovative designs exhibiting a high performance to weight ratio. Topology optimized designs are often characterized by a high geometrical complexity that is not possible to manufacture without 3 D printing. This work presents the CAE design methodology that was developed to combine topology and shape optimization with 3 d printing manufacturing. Novel developments both in shape and topology optimization have also been realized for the specific character of these components. The design methodology is illustrated with several applications of components of our new Eco Marathon prototype. They include a support for electric traction motors and different <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> of the steering mechanism to be implemented in the new 2017 vehicle. The presentation is going to show the different design steps from the specifications and the formulation of the design problem to the 3 D-printing of the parts: the topology optimization, interpretation and CAD reconstruction, shape optimization and detailed finite element verification of the solution. The optimization is performed thanks to the commercial software NX-TOPOL and the final CAD design is reconstructed in the CATIA environment software after a smoothing procedure in the NX-CAD environment. We show that the final design can be 3 D-printed and a comparison with a design produced using traditional design approach is provided...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{was performed in}} order to firstly establish the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a landing gear torque link configuration, and secondly to assess the effectiveness of both passive and active flow control as noise attenuation methods. Experimental and numerical data showed that afixing a torque link on to a half cylinder strut resulted in the suppression of vortex shedding in between the <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> This resulted in a narrower wake with reduced drag. PIV wake profiles showed the suppression of shedding to result in reduced velocity fluctuations, as shown by reductions in shear and normal Reynolds stresses. Simulation showed attaching the torque link to the strut {{to result in a}} reduction of farfield noise levels by up to 7. 5 dB. Altering the torque link angle ttheta was shown to affect the aerodynamic field, with a decrease in drag and wake strength, as shown by a reduction in mean and fluctuating velocities. However, altering the torque link angle was shown to have little affect on near field acoustics. Altering the yaw angle φ from φ = 0 º to 180 º was shown to affect periodic vortex shedding from the strut, with shedding occurring at lower frequencies for φ = 90 º and 135 º. Phased microphone array data showed interaction between the strut's wake and the downstream torque link to be the major source of noise for yaw angles with the torque link almost or entirely aligned with the strut. This interaction noise decreased when the torque link was out of alignment with the strut. The major source of noise for these yaw angles became edge noise due to the torque link extending into the freestream. Both {{experimental and}} numerical acoustics showed φ = 0 º and 180 º to exhibit the loudest OASPL. A conformal fairing applied over the torque link 'gap region' was found to be effective in attenuating interaction noise. The most effective application of the fairing was found for the standard yaw angle of φ = 0 º, with noise reductions of up to 4. 5 dB. Active flow control applied in the form of blowing from the landing gear strut was also found to be effective at reducing interaction noise when applied from blowing angles of 30 º and 90 º. Blowing was found to reduce the strength of the wake and to deflect the wake away from the downstream torque link, resulting in a decrease in tonal noise by up to 10. 3 dB and a reduction in broadband noise of up to 6 dB over 0. 01 ≤ St ≤ 1. <br/...|$|E
