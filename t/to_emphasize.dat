5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} {{that there may be}} a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.

5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E

5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E

5|$|Sponsored by Christian IV, Børsen, one of {{the first}} {{commodity}} exchanges in Europe, was built from 1618 to 1624. It was designed <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> Copenhagen's position as a commercial metropolis. Although inspired by the Dutch Renaissance style, the distinctive towers and garrets on the roof reflect the taste of Christian IV. The characteristic spire of the building with four intertwinded dragon tails topped by three crowns, symbolises the then Kingdom of Denmark, which included Norway and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Taoism tends <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> various {{themes of}} the I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, {{detachment}} from desires, and most important of all, wu wei.

5|$|The presidential {{campaign}} was Obama's first {{exposure to the}} national political scene; even before the field of Democratic candidates was narrowed to two, she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.

5|$|Timber-roofed basilicas, {{which had}} been the {{standard}} form until the 6th century, would be displaced by domed churches from the 9th century on. In the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843 – 1204), domes were normally built <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> separate functional spaces, rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.|$|E

The ability to automatically install a Windows Store app across all devices associated with an account was also removed.|$|E

The issue of quality touches upon a theme which has been much debated during the past 20 years: namely, the role of kindergartens in a lifelong learning perspective.

5|$|A life-size {{sculpture}} of the {{coat of arms}} was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986. Rosen took some liberty with the design, such as adding farm tools <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the city's agricultural and trading history, as well as adding previously undocumented detail; the left supporter also takes on more of the look of an explorer (e.g., Henry Hudson) than a farmer. The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan {{as part of the}} park across Broadway from the then-newly renovated Union Station, which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees out of the building in 2010. The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway.|$|E

They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E
5|$|Another {{adaptation}} {{of a classic}} European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of The Lower Depths, based on a play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this {{adaptation of}} Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late Edo period—unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response {{similar to that of}} Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.|$|E
