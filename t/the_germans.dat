5|$|On 14 November, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić {{to clear a}} corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, marching to the west of <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Bréville, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> never seriously {{attempted}} {{to break through the}} airborne division's lines again. The British division only being subjected to sporadic artillery and mortar fire. This lasted until 17August, when <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> started to withdraw and the 6th Airborne Division advanced to the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|As a {{deception}} unit, {{the division}} {{was assigned to}} the bogus Operation Trolleycar. Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands, by the phantom British Fourth Army, to exploit the success of the authentic Operation Market Garden. When the Battle of Arnhem failed, the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped. Trolleycar was revived to convince <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> that the Fourth Army would land near Emden, in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army, that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands. The deception effort was kept up until 1945, being wound down in January. Despite the British ceasing their attempts to deceive <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> about this possible landing and <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> not believing all that had been reported to them, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>German</b> Army Aviation Corps (Heeresfliegertruppe) is {{a special}} unit within <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Armed Forces (Bundeswehr). <b>The</b> <b>German</b> Army Aviation Corps is a branch of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Army (Heer), {{containing}} all its helicopter units. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> Air Force and <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Navy both also have their own helicopter units.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>German</b> term Bürgerblock-Regierung (English: bourgeois bloc administration) denotes a {{government}} coalition in <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Weimar Republic. It consisted of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Democratic Party, Zentrum, the Bavarian People's Party, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> People's Party and <b>the</b> <b>German</b> National People's Party (or at least {{most of these}} parties).|$|R
5|$|At 10:00, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> {{began their}} most {{successful}} {{assault on the}} perimeter, attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks. This assault pushed through the defenders' outer lines and threatened to isolate {{the bulk of the}} division from the river. Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1902, {{the colonial}} {{government}} appointed him their {{representative to the}} Ewondo people, and interpreter and clerk for <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> posted in Jaunde. He was tasked with organising a census and tax collection system. He chose 300 headmen to be tax collectors, of whom <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> approved 233. Atangana negotiated a cut of 5% for the collectors, much to their delight.|$|E

5|$|High {{figures for}} tanks lost {{during the battle}} have been widely {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Hindered by total Allied {{air superiority}} and a {{large-scale}} uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> decided to withdraw towards the north through the Rhône valley, {{to establish a}} stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, {{the ship}} was {{decommissioned}} in La Spezia. She was scuttled there on 9 September 1943, {{a day after the}} armistice that ended the war for Italy was declared to prevent her from being seized by <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> who rapidly moved to occupy the country after Italy surrendered. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> captured the ship and re-floated her, though she was sunk by Allied bombers on 23 October. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> re-floated the ship again, and again she was sunk by bombers, on 23 September 1944 in the outer La Spezia roadstead, where <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> had moved the hulk to block one of the entrances to the Gulf of La Spezia. Taranto was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap in 1946–1947.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, Nedić {{sent the}} 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK to Montenegro to {{supplement}} Đurišić's forces. In {{the first half}} of 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> in Montenegro and the Sandžak organised offensives against the Partisans, largely relying on forces under the command of Lašić and Đurišić. Because of the weakness of their own forces, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> contributed by commanding and supplying the troops involved, and providing smaller mobile armoured units with heavy weapons. The Chetnik leaders provided most of the troops. In February and March, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and numerous Chetnik units undertook a series of operations codenamed Bora, Baumblüte and Vorfrühling around Podgorica.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April, the Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea.

The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> had withdrawn, however. On 24 May, the fleet {{conducted a}}nother demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|She was at Toulon when <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> invaded Vichy France and was scuttled {{there on}} 27 November 1942 to avoid capture by <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> Refloated by the Italians on 1 May 1943, Commandant Teste was {{captured}} by <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> in September 1943 and sunk again the following year by Allied bombs on 18–19 August 1944. Raised again in February 1945, she was still thought to be repairable and was considered for conversion as an escort or training carrier.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> {{advanced}} {{north and}} west from Kladanj towards a cordon established by ten Croatian Home Guard battalions supported by their own artillery. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> believed they had thoroughly sealed off the area, and checked the Croatian cordon every night, {{but the majority of}} Partisans were able to evade the cordon and escape by breaking up into small groups and infiltrating through the cordon through seemingly impassable terrain. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> also believed that some Partisans merely withdrew into the mountains, concealing their numbers by walking in each other's snowprints, in order to return to the valleys when the Axis forces left. The operation concluded on 4 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> {{attacked}} at dawn {{under the}} cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a German company in the early morning which was quickly resolved, partly due to the gallantry of Sergeant Stanley McDougall of the Australian 47th Battalion, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> failed to break through the Allied defences. McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy. By late afternoon, rain was setting in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, with the Australians losing around 137 killed or wounded. In the following week, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> renewed attempts to advance in the sector, culminating in the Second Battle of Dernancourt on 5 April, in which <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> were defeated in desperate fighting.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> {{did not see}} the Canadian Corps's {{capture of}} Vimy Ridge as a loss. Contemporary German sources viewed the action, at worst, as a draw, given that no {{full-scale}} breakthrough occurred following the attack. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> did not attempt to recapture the ridge, even during the Spring Offensive and it remained under British control {{until the end of the}} war. The loss of Vimy Ridge forced <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> to reassess their defensive strategy in the area. Instead of mounting a counterattack, they pursued a scorched earth policy and retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. The complete failure of the French Nivelle Offensive in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on Field Marshal Douglas Haig to keep <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses. The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the Battle of Arleux and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them.
