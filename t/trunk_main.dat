25|$|In 1987, {{a private}} tourist firm, Globetrotter Tours New Zealand Ltd leased a New Zealand Railways Corporation single {{lavatory}} first class NZR 56-foot carriage, utilised on the South Island Main <b>Trunk</b> <b>Main</b> South Line's Southerner express passenger trains for private {{use as a}} luxury tourist alternative to the rail services then offered by InterCity Rail.|$|E
2500|$|The train used {{extensively}} refurbished NZR 56-foot carriages that dated from 1937-40. Ten cars were built as two-lavatory 31-seat first class cars, later designated North Island Main Trunk first class cars, for expresses on this route, two (with staff/hostess compartments retained and augmented) as the South Island Main <b>Trunk</b> <b>Main</b> South Line single-lavatory 29 seat equivalent, along with four 16-berth sleeping cars. In their refurbished form, the day cars seated 30 {{in the same}} type of [...] "bucket" [...] seat and the day cars with staff compartments seated 25. The sleeping cars still each accommodated 16 (2 berths in 8 cabins). In 1973 larger train sets were planned with the fitting of 20 first class and sleeping cars (7 + 3 x 2) with Goko heaters from Tohzai Gongyo Boek the tender offer on 21 Jan 1973 from Gongyo in Japan was 4 million yen, for 20 carriage heaters and control systems resulting in a decision to use the old heavy steam vans which in itself limited, train size and suggested completely new trainsets of non stainless steel material would have cost less and allowed better use of the NZRs short staffed rolling stock fitters. However saving overseas funds became the priority after the 1973 war in the Middle East, multiplied oil costs and the final fit out of the train was not approved until November 1974 with instructions to complete the rebuild of the minimum rolling stock for the introduction of the Express replacement within 12 months.|$|E

50|$|Further {{away from}} town, the {{railways}} also altered geography. New communities developed around railway yards and facilities {{to house the}} workers. The largest of these was East Toronto, which developed east of the city around the Grand <b>Trunk's</b> <b>main</b> yards. In {{the eastern part of}} Scarborough, Irish railway workers built up the town of West Hill. The existing small town of Leaside grew rapidly after a maintenance yard was built nearby.|$|R

50|$|The suburb is {{the site}} of a number of {{important}} railway linkages in the New Zealand railway network, mainly the North Island <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> Railway and East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> Railway. The suburb is the northern terminus of the North Island <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> electrification, a large locomotive depot and formerly a large marshalling yard. The suburb contains a Video Ezy that until 2014 was the last known venue that still allowed original Sony PlayStation game rentals in the Waikato region.|$|R

50|$|The Serpentine Dam {{is one of}} {{the major}} water supply dams for Perth, Western Australia. The dam is used to store water which is {{released}} at a controlled rate to regulate the level in Serpentine Pipehead Dam, which in turn feeds water to the metropolitan <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> network depending on demand. Construction of the dam was completed in 1961.|$|E

50|$|The tunnel {{originates}} {{just west}} of Canning Dam and runs for approximately 5.6 km through the granite Darling Scarp to the western portal <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> in Soldiers Road about 1 km South of the Brookton Highway intersection. It measures 2.7 m x 2.7 m. A separate 910 mm pipeline from Canning Dam remains. The tunnel is more than 120 m below ground level at its deepest point.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} treatment {{process was}} by slow sand filtration, flowing by gravity from the draw-off tower to the filter beds. The water was piped to a water tank {{at the foot}} of the dam and then to a second tank before flowing along a gravity <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> down the Douglas Valley. The second tank can be seen today, a very long, low building with a pitched roof {{at the foot of}} the dam.|$|E
50|$|The {{water from}} Lake Vyrnwy is carried 68 mi to Liverpool in the Vyrnwy Large Diameter <b>Trunk</b> <b>Main</b> (LDTM) aqueduct. This {{originally}} {{consisted of two}} pipelines, made largely of cast iron. To help maintenance work on the 9 ft diameter cast-iron tunnel which took the aqueduct under the Mersey, riveted steel piping was also used. This was an early use of the material which was to become the norm for trunk water-main piping.|$|E

50|$|The Argana Park sports precinct in the {{southwest}} of the suburb is home to football, rugby league, cricket and netball clubs. More playing fields in the northeastern corner of the suburb include a local soccer club and more cricket. Smith Creek linear park separates these {{from the rest of}} the suburb. There is a linear reserve along the easement for a major water pipe, the Barossa <b>Trunk</b> <b>Main,</b> running roughly north-south above ground through Elizabeth Downs. There is also a buffer reserve along Main North Road.|$|E
50|$|Water supply from Manly Dam {{had been}} {{augmented}} with supply {{from the main}} metropolitan system starting in 1906, initially from Mosman reservoir. By 1928 it was realised that Manly Dam had reached its limits and all future expansion would rely on the main metropolitan system. A <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> was therefore laid from the Pymble reservoir and pumping from Manly Dam ceased in 1933. Briefly in 1942 {{after a period of}} drought, pumps were reinstalled and Manly Dam was brought back into service for nearly 10 months.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the lines}} first major traffic sources was A & G Price of Thames, who started {{producing}} locomotives for NZGR from 1904. Following {{the completion of the}} North Island <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> in 1908, the government began planning the East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> in 1909, eventually to connect to Gisborne. Work began in 1911 on a link from Paeroa through the Karangahake Gorge to Waihi. From this stage the Thames Branch was defined as Paeroa to Thames, with the Morrinsville - Paeroa section being designated as part of the East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk.</b> In 1928 the passenger service was being provided by a steam railcar. The opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1979 and the closure of the Paeroa - Katikati section of the East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Trunk</b> led to the re-designation of the Morrinsville - Thames section as the Thames Branch.|$|R
50|$|The Forth Bridge {{was opened}} on 4 March 1890, {{crossing}} from Dalmeny to North Queensferry. Railway branch lines {{had already been}} built to the respective shore locations {{in connection with the}} long-standing ferry, but these were unsuitable to form part of a <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> line. The North British Railway built a new direct line from Saughton Junction (a few miles west of Edinburgh) to Dalmeny and from Inverkeithing (immediately north of North Queensferry) to Burntisland. The Granton to Burntisland ferry was discontinued and Burntisland became a wayside location on the new through route.|$|E
50|$|In December 1902 the Grand Trunk Western and the Toledo, St Louis & Western (known as the Clover Leaf) {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to jointly purchase the Shore Line property by issuing bonds for the payment of outstanding obligations. At {{the same time they}} contracted to extend the line northward from Trenton to a connection with the Wabash at River Rouge, {{on the south side of}} Detroit. The new owners intended to bring the Shore Line up to the same general standards as the Grand <b>Trunk</b> <b>main</b> line, a task that would require considerable additional track work.|$|E
50|$|The South Wales Railway was {{planning}} a <b>trunk</b> <b>main</b> line from near Gloucester to Fishguard. The Llanelly company attempted {{to sell its}} line to the South Wales Railway, but that approach did not bear fruit, and in January 1850 a contract was made with Ianson, Fossick and Hackworth to work and maintain the line. They operated a through passenger service between Swansea and Llandilo from May 1850, consisting of omnibuses at each end and railway transit from Pontardulais and Duffryn. The contract had been intended to operate for seven years but it was terminated by mutual consent in August 1853.|$|E
