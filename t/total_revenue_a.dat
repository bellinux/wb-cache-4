IBM's own documentation described the PC as inferior to competitors' less-expensive products, but the company generally did not compete on price; rather, the study found that they preferred [...] "IBM's hegemony" [...] because of its support. Most companies with mainframes used their PCs with the larger computers, which likely benefited IBM's mainframe sales and discouraged their purchasing non-IBM hardware.|$|E

Reforms are seeking to restore the popular goal of competitive balance.

However, how a system control can enhance profit and simultaneously satisfy the {{service level agreements}} (SLAs) {{has become one of}} the major interests for cloud providers. In this paper, a cloud server farm provided with finite capacity is modeled as an M/M/R/K queuing system. Revenue losses are estimated according to the system controls and impatient customer behaviors. Three important issues are solved in this paper. First, a profit function is developed in which both the system blocking loss and the user abandonment loss are evaluated in <b>total</b> <b>revenue.</b> <b>A</b> tradeoff between meeting system performances and reducing operating costs is conducted. Second, the effects of system capacity control and utilization on various performances of waiting time, loss probability, and final arrival rate are demonstrated.

Material and methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The study population are the websites of catering companies entrusted with the management of school canteens. The sample was obtained using Google search engine and a ranking of major catering companies financial, choosing those that had websites. Ten websites were selected for a pilot test according to geographic proximity to the city of Alicante and their <b>total</b> <b>revenue.</b> <b>A</b> homemade questionnaire (EDALCAT) was designed in order to evaluate the websites. This questionnaire is composed of a block of predictors of quality with 19 variables for reliability, design and navigation; and a second block of specific contents about food education with 19 variables for content and educational activities. Results: Positive results have been obtained in 31 out of 38 questionnaire variables, except for the items: “Search engine”, “Language” (40 %) and “Help” (10 %) in the predictors of the quality block; and in the items: “Workshops”, “Recipe book”, “Web nutrition-food” (40 %) and “Examples” (30 %) in the specific contents of the food education block. All the evaluated websites exceed 50 % of compliance with the quality criteria and with the minimum contents in food education, and only one of them, fails the minimum level of activity established. Conclusions: The predictors of quality and the specific content in food education were successful in all evaluated websites. Most of them got a high score in their assessment, and in their analysis of individual blocks. After the pilot study, EDALCAT questionnaire has been amended and the final EDALCAT has been obtained. Generally speaking, EDALCAT seems appropriate for evaluating the quality of catering companies websites and their content regarding food education, however the present study can not be considered as validation of it. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} a {{monopoly}} has a downward-sloping demand curve means {{that the relationship between}} <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> equals price times quantity. A competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is proportional to output. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for <b>a</b> competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price. A competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price. For a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for <b>a</b> monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is again zero. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> has its maximum value when the slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is zero. The slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is marginal revenue. So the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when MR = 0.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} promises on-demand provisioning {{of resource}} to applications and services. To deal with dynamically fluctuating resource demands, market-driven resource allocation {{has been proposed}} and recently implemented by commercial cloud providers like Amazon EC 2. In this environment, cloud resources are offered in distinct types of virtual machines (VMs) and the cloud provider runs a continuous market-driven mechanism for each VM type {{with the goal of}} achieving maximum revenue over time. However, as demand of each VM type can fluctuate independently at run time, it becomes a challenging problem to dynamically allocate data center resources to each spot market to maximize cloud provider’s <b>total</b> <b>revenue.</b> In this paper, we present a solution to this problem that consists of 2 parts: (1) market analysis for forecasting the demand for each spot market, and (2) a dynamic scheduling and consolidation mechanism that allocate resource to each spot market to maximize <b>total</b> <b>revenue.</b> <b>As</b> optimally allocating resources for <b>revenue</b> maximization is <b>a</b> NP-hard problem, we show our algorithms can approximate the optimal solutions to this problem under both fixed and variable pricing schemes.

However, introducing new elements and features in existing (often mature) software may cause unexpected problems. These problems may include new parts malfunctioning and failure or degradation of old functions. To avoid these problems, each version of software has to be thoroughly tested, not only to test the new parts, but also to verify that the old functions still work properly.

40|$|The single-output {{production}} function {{has long been}} {{regarded as one of}} the principle limitations of the econometric approach to technical efficiency measurement. If one wished to investigate efficiency in a multiple-output industry using econometric methods one would usually either: (a) aggregate outputs into a single index of output (e. g., <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> or <b>a</b> multilateral Tornqvist output index); or (b) attempt to model the technology using a dual cost function. The first of these methods require that output prices be observable (and reflect revenue maximising behaviour), while the latter approach requires an assumption of cost-minimising behaviour. There are a number of instances, however, when neither of these requirements are met (the public sector contains many examples). In this study we outline the recently developed distance function solution to the multi-output problem. The method is illustrated using data on European railways. Output-orientated, input-orientated and constant returns to scale distance functions are estimated using corrected ordinary least squares. The distance function estimates are also compared with {{production function}} estimates involving aggregate output measures.
