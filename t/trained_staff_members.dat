50|$|Camp Ondessonk offers {{specialized}} programs, {{referred to}} as adventure camp, that allow campers to focus on one set of skills {{in a particular area}} for an entire week. The main areas of focus are horsemanship, rock climbing, backpacking, mountain biking, and canoeing. The programs take a limited number of campers and provide them with the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills of a particular area. Campers are assisted by two or three specially <b>trained</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> As with traditional campers, all adventure campers are eligible for induction into Lodge. The adventure programs are divided into three levels based on the challenge offered and skill required by each program. Beginner adventures, formerly known as level one, is the first level meant for campers who want to build their skills while still enjoying a traditional camp experience in the evenings. Campers stay in a unit as in traditional camp. No prior experience in the area of focus is required. Beginner adventures include Horse Camp, Rock Camp, and Hike, Bike, Paddle, and Climb. Intermediate adventures, formerly called level two programs, offer a more intense experience and greater challenge to campers. During an intermediate adventure, campers spend more time away from the main area of camp in the natural areas surrounding Ondessonk. Most nights of the program are spent camping out under the stars in the babackcountryIntermediate adventures give participants the chance to receive more advanced instruction and develop their skills to a greater level. Although campers {{spend most of their time}} away from main camp, they do return at the end of the week to participate in the all-camp activities on Friday. Intermediate adventure programs include Horse Adventure, Rock Adventure, Mountain Biking Adventure, and Camper vs. Wild. Intermediate adventures do not require prior experience in their field of focus, hohowever,t is recommended. The final level of adventure programs is advanced adventures, formerly known as level three. This level is recommended for only those experienced in the Ondessonk adventure programs. Advanced adventures offer an intense and challenging opportunity to expand on the skills learned in the beginner and intermediate levels. As with intermediate adventures, campers spend most of their time away from main camp building their skills on the trails around camp. There are two advanced adventures offered, Horse Expedition and River Adventure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{adolescents}} live in resource-constrained {{countries and}} their mental health {{has been less}} well recognised than other aspects of their health. The World Health Organization's 4 -S Framework provides a structure for national initiatives to improve adolescent health through: gathering and using strategic information; developing evidence-informed policies; scaling up provision and use of health services; and strengthening linkages with other government sectors. The aim {{of this paper is}} to discuss how the findings of a recent systematic review of mental health problems in adolescents in resource-constrained settings might be applied using the 4 -S Framework. Method Analysis of the implications of the findings of a systematic search of the English-language literature for national strategies, policies, services and cross-sectoral linkages to improve the mental health of adolescents in resource-constrained settings. Results Data are available for only 33 / 112 [29 %] resource-constrained countries, but in all where data are available, non-psychotic mental health problems in adolescents are identifiable, prevalent and associated with reduced quality of life, impaired participation and compromised development. In the absence of evidence about effective interventions in these settings expert opinion is that a broad public policy response which addresses direct strategies for prevention, early intervention and treatment; health service and health workforce requirements; social inclusion of marginalised groups of adolescents; and specific education is required. Specific endorsed strategies include public education, parent education, training for teachers and primary healthcare workers, psycho-educational curricula, identification through periodic screening of the most vulnerable and referral for care, and the availability of counsellors or other identified <b>trained</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> in schools from whom adolescents can seek assistance for personal, peer and family relationship problems. Conclusion The predominant endorsed action is not that dedicated mental health services for adolescents are required, but that mental health care should be integrated using cross-sectoral strategies into the communities in which adolescents live, the institutions they attend and the organisations in which they participate. </p...|$|E

40|$|Persistent memory {{impairment}} is a near universal problem after sustaining {{a traumatic}} brain injury (TBI). One aspect of memory impairment that may negatively influence survivors 2 ̆ 7 social interactions is face-name recall. The inability to remember someone 2 ̆ 7 s name may generate feelings of discomfort between conversational partners. Improving a survivor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to use spontaneously the names {{of one or two}} people with whom they interact daily may improve self-esteem and minimize uneasiness. This study compared the efficacy of three generalization training programs—name restating, phonemic cueing, visual imagery—on survivors 2 ̆ 7 ability to learn and use spontaneously face-name associations within real-world contexts. In this study, two types of training occurred—familiarization training and generalization training. As part of familiarization training, the researcher conducted one-on-one training sessions with each of five survivors of TBI. Sessions were held three times per week for three weeks. During these sessions, the researcher paired imagery statements with pictures of the staff members to facilitate learning of face-name associations. Staff members interacted with the survivors twice daily. After completing familiarization training, generalization training began. The researcher <b>trained</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> at the transitional living facility where the survivors resided to implement one of the three generalization training programs—name restating, phonemic cueing, or visual imagery. These staff members continued interacting with the survivors twice daily to promote name learning and use. It was hypothesized that the visual imagery generalization training program would be most effective in facilitating name learning and use among the survivors of TBI. Additionally, it was expected that maintenance of name use and knowledge would be best for names trained during this program. Results showed no significant difference between generalization training programs on survivors 2 ̆ 7 ability to learn and spontaneously use face-name associations. Furthermore, no consistent patterns arose for maintenance of name use and knowledge. However, all but one participant demonstrated name use and knowledge for at least two target names during one or more generalization training programs. Detailed results, possible explanations, and clinical implications are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT This study {{aimed to}} assess if an {{additional}} patient feedback training programme leads to better consultation skills in general practice trainees (GPTs) than regular communication skills training, and whether process measurements (intensity {{of participation in}} the programme) predict the effect of the intervention. METHODS We carried out a controlled trial in which two sub-cohorts of GPTs were allocated to an intervention group (n = 23) or a control group (n = 30), respectively. In 2006, allocated first-year GPTs in the VU University Medical Centre attended a patient feedback training programme in addition to the regular communication skills training. The control group attended only regular communication skills training. Trainees were assessed by simulated patients who visited the practices and videotaped the consultations at baseline and after 3 months. The videotapes were randomly assigned to eight <b>trained</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members.</b> The MAAS-Global Instrument (range 0 - 6) was used to assess (a change in) trainee consultation skills. Results were analysed using a multi-level, linear mixed-model analysis. Results Data on 50 GPTs were available for the follow-up analysis. Both intervention group and control group GPTs improved their consultation skills: mean MAAS-Global scores for all participants were 3. 29 (standard deviation [SD] 0. 75) at baseline and 3. 54 (SD 0. 66) at follow-up (P = 0. 047). The improvement in MAAS-Global scores in the intervention group did not differ significantly from the improvement in the control group. The analysis showed a trend for intensity {{of participation in the}} patient feedback programme to predict greater improvement in MAAS-Global scores. DISCUSSION Although the baseline scores were already in the high range, consultation skills in both groups improved significantly. This is reassuring for current teaching methods. The patient feedback programme did not improve consultation skills more than regular communication skills training. However, a subgroup of GPTs who participated intensively in the programme did improve their consultation skills further in comparison with the less motivated subgroup. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010...|$|E

This study aims to analyze factors which influenced the assistance given to patients who had cardiorespiratory arrest, in pre hospital environment of Advanced Support Units (ASU), {{in the city of}} Belo Horizonte, during 2005. To collect the data, we prepared an instrument containing Ustein style based variables. Statistical analysis such as associations, descriptive and space analysis were used to treat the data. Patients (n= 1548) who had cardiorespiratory arrest were included. Space analysis of patients assisted in Belo Horizonte demonstrated lack of clusters. The majority had assistance during day time, between Saturday and Tuesday, with a mean of 5 per day, and 129 per month. The majority (68. 8 %) were male, age ranging from 0 to 106 years, with a mean of 45 to 54 years old. The cardiorespiratory arrests were classified according to clinical and external causes. The majority presented clinical causes (62. 2 %). The ASU which assisted the patients in Belo Horizonte had a mean time-response of 10. 3 minutes to arrive at the local, and of 18 minutes in other cities around. The majority of patients were already dead when the staff arrived. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was done on 351 patientes, and 33. 3 % presented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, without the presence of pulse on the first evaluation. Among these, 23. 6 % had immediate recovery and were taken to a hospital. The ambulance time-response, the CPR, and the cardiac rhythm were the factors that influenced immediate survival after CPR. Logistic regression, however, indicated only the CPR maneuver and the cardiac rhythm as significant. Patients who had CPR by the ASU and Mobile Emergency Service (SAMU/BH) teams had 2, 8 more immediate survival chance and who had cardiac rhythm such as asystolia showed 2. 6 times less immediate survival chance. Other variables did not show association with immediate survival after CPR.
