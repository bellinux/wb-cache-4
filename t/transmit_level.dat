40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} acoustic optimization study conducted at John Day Dam during January and February 2008. The goal {{of the study was to}} optimize performance of the Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) by determining deployment and data acquisition methods to minimize electrical and acoustic interference from various other acoustic sampling devices. Thereby, this would allow concurrent sampling by active and passive acoustic methods during the formal evaluations of the prototype surface flow outlets at the dam during spring and summer outmigration seasons for juvenile salmonids. The objectives for the optimization study at John Day Dam were to: 1. Design and test prototypes and provide a total needs list of pipes and trolleys to deploy JSATS hydrophones on the forebay face of the powerhouse and spillway. 2. Assess the effect on mean percentage decoded of JSATS transmissions from tags arrayed in the forebay and detected on the hydrophones by comparing: turbine unit OFF vs. ON; spill bay OPEN vs. CLOSED; dual frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) both OFF vs. ON at a spill bay; and, fixed-aspect hydroacoustic system OFF vs. ON at a turbine unit and a spill bay. 3. Determine the relationship between fixed-aspect hydroacoustic <b>transmit</b> <b>level</b> and mean percentage of JSATS transmissions decoded. The general approach was to use hydrophones to listen for transmissions from JSATS tags deployed in vertical arrays in a series perpendicular to the face of the dam. We used acoustic telemetry equipment manufactured by Technologic and Sonic Concepts. In addition, we assessed old and new JSATS signal detectors and decoders and two different types of hydrophone baffling. The optimization study consisted of a suite of off/on tests. The primary response variable was mean percentage of tag transmissions decoded. We found that there was no appreciable adverse effect on mean percentage decoded for JSATS transmitters from: turbine operations; spillway operations; DIDSON/ADCP acoustic energy; and PAS hydroacoustic systems at <b>transmit</b> <b>level</b> of - 12 dB, although there was a significant impact at all higher transmit levels (- 11 to - 6 dB). The main conclusion from this optimization study is that valid JSATS telemetry data can be collected simultaneously with a DIDSON/ADCP and a PAS hydroacoustic system at <b>transmit</b> <b>level</b> - 12 dB. Multiple evaluation tools should be considered to increase the robustness and thoroughness of future fish passage evaluations at John Day and other dams...|$|E

The second is the optimal transmit power and carrier phase adjustment, which computes the optimal <b>transmit</b> power <b>level</b> and carrier phase offset, and feeds the information—which includes the optimal <b>transmit</b> power <b>levels</b> and carrier phase shifts—back to the transmitters as described in Figure  1.

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a MAC/PHY cross-layer {{approach}} for enhancing the separation and decoding performance of compound signals on an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with phase noise effects. Specifically, {{this article focuses}} on more complex and realistic scenarios than our previous study in [10]. In this article, we consider the coordination of not only the transmitters’ carrier phase offsets but also their <b>transmit</b> power <b>levels.</b> In this system, a receiver with MPR capability performs multiuser detection and then estimates the symbol energy and the carrier phase offset for each transmitter’s signal from the compound signals. Next, the receiver piggybacks the optimal <b>transmit</b> power <b>level</b> and carrier phase shift, which is the difference between the estimated carrier phase offset and an optimal carrier phase offset, to the corresponding transmitters so that they can adjust their transmit power and carrier phase offset to the optimal value when transmitting signals. To determine the optimal <b>transmit</b> power <b>level</b> and carrier phase shift, we formulate an optimization problem in order to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between the constellation coordinates of the compound signals. We subsequently evaluate the performance of the proposed <b>transmit</b> power <b>level</b> and carrier phase adjustment scheme and compare it to that of the no adjustment case for QPSK and 8 PSK with 2 – 4 transmitters. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the error probability for all cases investigated in our simulation scenarios.|$|R
