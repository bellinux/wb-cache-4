5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock.

5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E

The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>in</b> trees, underground or on two legs.

5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> summer and warmer than <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E

5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>In</b> other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of moisture in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> order {{for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>In</b> December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
5|$|Following the charmed ring, Sophie passes into a {{scene from}} the past. She watched a young Howl take pity on a falling star—Calcifer—and give it his heart. The act bound Calcifer to Howl indefinitely; however, by losing his heart, Howl was emotionally trapped in adolescence. Sophie finds Howl in bird form, and takes him back to Calcifer. The witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, {{returning}} him to life and freeing Calcifer. Howl wakes up and Sophie embraces him. Although Calcifer is now free, he returns to his former company. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. Howl, Sophie, and the others are seen high in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a new flying castle, while the bombers return from the war.|$|E

As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the growing debate over Zeus' abilities, the US {{conducted}} its first high yield, high altitude tests – Hardtack Teak on 1 August 1958, and Hardtack Orange on 12 August. These demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects, notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> or immediately below the fireball to become opaque to radar signals, an effect that became known as nuclear blackout. This was extremely worrying for any system like Zeus, which {{would not be able to}} track warheads in or behind such a fireball, including those of the Zeus' own warheads.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
