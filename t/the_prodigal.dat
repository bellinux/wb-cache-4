5|$|In June and July 2013 {{as part of}} the centenary, Aurora Orchestra and Mahogany Opera gave {{performances}} of Curlew River, The Burning Fiery Furnace and <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son (Britten) at St Bartholomew's Church, Orford (where all three pieces were premiered) to critical acclaim. The director was Freddie Wake-Walker and the musical director was Roger Vignoles.|$|E
5|$|The Gates of Hell {{comprised}} 186 {{figures in}} its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, The Falling Man, and <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son.|$|E
5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The Masque at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871). He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
5|$|The Maltings {{gave the}} festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten {{conducted}} the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970. Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten; he was himself the dedicatee of <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son. Two other Russian musicians who {{were close to}} Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his cello suites, Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son – which {{at the time of their}} original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> (1955), {{followed}} by the John Wayne adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This was a difficult time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; the public was staying home. Turner {{was just one of}} MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of King CharlesII in 1660 his father's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the better, although he remained far from prosperous. In 1661, Winston became Member of Parliament for Weymouth, and as a mark of royal favour he received rewards for losses incurred fighting against the Parliamentarians during the civil war, including the appointment as a Commissioner for Irish Land Claims in Dublin in 1661. When Winston departed for Ireland the following year, John enrolled at the Dublin Free School; but by 1664, following his father's recall to the position of Junior Clerk Comptroller of the King's Household at Whitehall, John had transferred his studies to St Paul's School in London. The King's own penury meant the old Cavaliers received scant financial reward, but <b>the</b> <b>prodigal</b> monarch could offer something which would cost him nothing – positions at court for their progeny. Thus in 1665, John's sister Arabella became Maid of Honour to Anne Hyde, the Duchess of York. Some months later John, 15, joined her at court serving as page to Anne's husband, James, Duke of York, the King's brother, destined to be king himself. It was also known that John Churchill, a keen student, was educated in the University of Oxford, where he studied philosophy, classics and mathematics. He was well-educated and proficient in French, Latin, Greek and German.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son {{was also}} {{referred}} to in the play As You Like It, a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare. <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son is also mentioned in Shakespeare's romance, The Winter's Tale (Act 4, Scene 4 line 89).|$|E
50|$|Other {{plays by}} Franklin include <b>The</b> In-Crowd, <b>Prodigal</b> Daughter and Cut Out the Lights and Call <b>the</b> Law. <b>Prodigal</b> Daughter was adapted into a musical entitled, Prodigal Sister, which was {{produced}} by the Negro Ensemble Company in 1974.|$|R

25|$|From the Renaissance {{the numbers}} shown widened slightly, {{and the various}} scenes – the high living, herding the pigs, and the return – of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son became the clear favourite. Albrecht Dürer made a famous {{engraving}} of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance. Rembrandt depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career. At least one of his works, <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son in the Tavern, a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene - if the title was indeed the original intention of the artist. His late Return of <b>the</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son (1662–1669, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) {{is one of his}} most popular works.|$|E

25|$|In 1978 and 1981, Hung {{made two}} films that contain fine {{examples}} of the Wing Chun style. The first, Warriors Two was the most significant role to date for South Korean super kicker Casanova Wong, who teamed up with Hung in the final fight. The second film was <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son, in which the Wing Chun fighting was performed by Lam Ching-Ying. The release of <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> Son, along with another film directed by and co-starring Hung, Knockabout (1979) also shot his fellow Opera schoolmate Yuen Biao to stardom.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} adaptations {{added to the}} Biblical {{material}} to lengthen the story; for example, the 1955 film <b>The</b> <b>Prodigal</b> took considerable liberties, such as adding a temptress priestess of Astarte to the tale.|$|E
