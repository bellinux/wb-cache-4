25|$|In Iran in 1918, {{the work}} of reorganizing the trade unions began in earnest in Tehran during {{the closure of the}} Iranian {{constitutional}} parliament Majles.

In 1918, the newly organised union staged a 14-day strike and succeeded in reaching a collective agreement with employers to institute the eight-hours day, overtime pay, and medical care.

25|$|On May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces {{engaged the}} Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton's force drew {{up into a}} {{defensive}} line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen's) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton's men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman's brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.|$|E

Eveline assaults Ethan with hallucinations, but he overcomes them. Ethan injects Eveline with the toxin, but instead of killing her it reveals she is the elderly woman in a wheelchair, rapidly aging since her escape. Eveline mutates into a large monster and, aided by the arrival of a military squad, Ethan is able to kill her.|$|E
500|$|A {{keep and}} a {{protective}} wall would usually {{be built on}} top of the motte. Some walls would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight; this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square building that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. The early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep {{on top of the}} motte at the castle of Ardres, where the [...] "first storey was {{on the surface of the}} ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils.
