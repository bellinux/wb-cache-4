5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> {{have been far}} more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the House of Representatives {{required}} that the final two days of the chamber's session be reserved for overriding any vetoes by the governor. Beshear hoped that <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> suspend the rules, as they had in previous years, in order to consider bills to increase funding to public defenders, create a transportation authority to oversee bridge-building projects in Louisville and Henderson, and provide various economic incentives, including a package intended to lure a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race to Kentucky Speedway. The House refused to suspend the rules, however, citing its desire to receive legislation {{in a timely manner}} in the future. The chamber allowed Beshear's one veto to stand and adjourned a day early.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>would</b> have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Upon Mowry's death, {{his wife}} {{retained}} the house until {{selling it to}} Stephen Paine on September 5, 1671. Paine conveyed it to Samuel Whipple who resided in the house {{until his death in}} 1711. Upon his death the house was recorded as having a two-story lean-to. Whipple transferred the property to his wife and upon her death, which passed to their daughters Abigail and Hope Whipple. Hope Whipple would marry Robert Currie and upon her death, Robert Currie would marry her sister Abigail Whipple, and upon her death fell to Robert Currie's ownership. In 1737, Currie sold the house to William Smith, Job Whipple and John Whipple. It remained in the Whipple family until 1761 when it was sold to Captain Joseph Owen. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> take its final name, the Abbott House, from Thomas Abbott who married Joseph Owen's daughter and resided in the house until his death in 1826. The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker tenement house. At the time of its demolition, it was the oldest house in Providence.|$|E
25|$|The house, {{stable and}} land {{would be put}} up {{for sale in the}} spring of 1893 for unpaid taxes of $123, about $2,500 today. It also had a $2,000 {{mortgage}} left at five percent interest. In October 1893, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be sold.|$|E
50|$|On May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph of the Virginia {{delegation}} {{proposed the}} creation of a bicameral legislature. Under his proposal, membership in both <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> be allocated to each state proportional to its population; however, candidates for <b>the</b> lower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be nominated and elected by the people of each state. This proposal allowed fairness and equality to the people. Candidates for <b>the</b> upper <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be nominated by the state legislatures of each state and then elected by the members of <b>the</b> lower <b>house.</b> This proposal was known as the Virginia Plan.|$|R

There are huge doors that were once used as an {{entrance}} for horses and carriages. Iron rings used to tie up horses can still be seen on an adjacent building. <b>The</b> Carriage <b>House</b> <b>would</b> have perhaps also been used as living quarters for a coachman, as was typical for the time period.|$|R

25|$|Similarly, the Sifra {{taught that}} Moses sought to comfort Aaron, {{telling him that}} at Sinai, God told him that God would sanctify God's house through a great man.

But Moses said that it turned out that Aaron's sons were greater and Moses and Aaron, for through them had the house been sanctified.|$|E
25|$|While the German {{policy towards}} Jews was {{ruthless}} and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews {{was very much}} the same. The Germans would often murder non-Jewish Poles for small misdemeanors. Execution for help rendered to Jews, {{even the most basic}} kinds, was automatic. In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, everybody in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be immediately shot by the Germans. For this thousands of non-Jewish Poles were executed.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{worked for}} the company or the {{government}} {{in one form or}} another. Residents did not own their homes; instead, they rented houses assigned primarily based on seniority in the zone. When an employee moved away, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be listed and employees could apply for it. The utility companies were also managed by the company. There were no independent stores; goods were brought in and sold at stores run by the company, such as a commissary, housewares, and so forth.|$|E

Plans for two more Lustron enclaves along Hackett Boulevard in Albany were canceled, since <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> never be built.|$|R

25|$|Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment {{specifies}} if the House of Representatives has {{not chosen}} a president-elect {{in time for}} the inauguration (noon EST on January 20), then the vice president-elect becomes acting president until the House selects a president.

25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>would</b> now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E
