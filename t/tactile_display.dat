Since these stimuli are directly mapped to body coordinates, <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> {{are able to}} present 3 D spatial information in an intuitive way. This paper (1) provides a short description of the <b>tactile</b> torso <b>display</b> that we developed, and (2) gives {{a brief overview of}} a simulator study on the usefulness of <b>tactile</b> torso <b>displays</b> in maintaining a stable hover with a helicopter. The results prove the potential of intuitive <b>tactile</b> torso <b>displays</b> in reducing drift during hover, and – more generally – prove that <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> can be applied in fast man-in-the-loop tasks.

In this article, we propose a model for tactile information flow using ontologies. The proposed model analyzes the existing knowledge in tactile information and helps defining the types of information that {{take part in the}} tactile information flow.

40|$|In many vehicle control situations, the operator's {{eyes and}} ears may become overloaded. For instance, while talking to our {{passengers}} and tuning-in to our favorite radio station, {{we may not be}} paying enough attention to the traffic. Many studies have shown that sensory overload may have serious effects on performance and safety. Presenting information via an alternative sensory modality may lessen the risk of visual and auditory overload. This has driven research into the use of the sense of touch to present vehicle control information. For example, vibrating elements in a driver's seat can provide navigation information or collision avoidance warnings. This paper presents an overview of a multi-year research program on <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> for vehicle control. We report fundamental studies into the perceptual issues in <b>tactile</b> vehicle control <b>displays,</b> as well applied studies into the behavioral effects of <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> on performance and mental workload. Important findings include that <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> can improve performance in comparison to visual displays, may result in lower mental effort ratings, and may reduce the detrimental effect of high mental workload on operator performance.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} friction based <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> for the simulation of finely textured surfaces, as such displays offer a promising way {{for the development of}} devices with co-located vision and tactile feedback. The resolution of the textures rendered with such devices and their matching to real textures have never been investigated. The paper first contributes to the evaluation of the texture resolution of friction based <b>tactile</b> <b>displays.</b> In a controlled experiment, {{we investigate}} the differential thresholds for square gratings simulated with a friction based tactile device by dynamic touch. Then we compare them to the differential thresholds of real square wave gratings. We found that the Weber fraction remains constant across the different spatial period at 9 %, which is close to the Weber fraction found for corresponding real square gratings. This study inclines us to conclude that friction based <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> offers a realistic alternative to pin based arrays and can be used for co-located vision and tactile rendering. From the results of the experiment, we also give the design guidelines to improve the perception of textures on friction based <b>tactile</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} of whether 144 tactile stimulators on a fingertip could be independently distinguished led to a confrontation at a scientific conference between Bliss and Frank Geldard, a University of Virginia professor. Geldard had written a major book on the human senses and was a leading researcher on using the sense of touch to communicate information. When asked how many tactile stimulators {{should be used in}} a <b>tactile</b> <b>display,</b> he maintained that no more than 8 tactile stimulators could be independently distinguished, and these should be on widely separated parts of the body. Bliss’ data showing useful reading with 144 stimulators on a fingertip appeared to be in conflict with Geldard’s research. The difference was between communicating using two dimensional tactile images versus an 8 point code. Both Bliss and Geldard were reporting similar reading rates, but in the days before high accuracy optical character recognition, the Optacon approach was much more practical.|$|E

The feedback allows the user to interact with a hologram and receive tactile responses as if the holographic object were real. The research uses ultrasound waves to create acoustic radiation pressure, which provides tactile feedback as users interact with the holographic object. The haptic technology {{does not affect the}} hologram, or the interaction with it, only the tactile response that the user perceives. The researchers posted a video displaying what they call the Airborne Ultrasound <b>Tactile</b> <b>Display.</b> , the technology was not ready for mass production or mainstream application in industry, but was quickly progressing, and industrial companies showed a positive response to the technology. This example of possible future application is the first in which the user {{does not have to be}} outfitted with a special glove or use a special control—they can [...] "just walk up and use it".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{most common}} methods of tactile {{presentation}} on touch screen, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> was directly attached or contacted onto the screen. Therefore, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> must be transparent {{so that it}} does not obstruct the view of the screen. On the other hand, if the tactile sensation is presented at back side of the device, the <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> {{does not need to be}} transparent. However, the cost of covering the whole back side with high-density <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is high. To overcome these limitations, we proposed to use a small and dense <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> placed at the back side and touched with one finger. The <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> is able to present the information around the operating finger touching the screen to the finger on back side of device.

40|$|AbstractA {{method to}} provide human tactile {{sensation}} using {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) was proposed. A stator transducer material (piezoelectric material) of a SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display,</b> however, had constraint of size and shape. Previously, to solve this problem, a new method was proposed to excite and propagate SAW on a non-piezoelectric material surface. Excitation and propagation of SAW on a non-piezoelectric material is realized by combination of a LiNbO 3 plate and a glass substrate. Using the method, the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> could realize tactile sensation {{in the same manner}} as the conventional SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> However, a relationship between the friction coefficient and vibration amplitude is unclear in the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display.</b> To decide and optimize the control parameters of the glass substrate SAW <b>tactile</b> <b>display,</b> the relation is needed.

40|$|Virtual surface {{characteristics}} of tactile displays are investigated {{to characterize the}} feeling of human touch for a haptic interface application. In order to represent the tactile feeling, a prototype <b>tactile</b> <b>display</b> incorporating Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid has been developed. <b>Tactile</b> <b>display</b> devices simulate the finger’s skin to feel the sensations of contact such as compliance, friction, and topography of the surface.

The skin nerves can be stimulated by mechanical, electrical or thermal stimuli. Apart from fibers for pain, skin has six more types of receptors. A review {{of the state of the}} art concerning the physiological and technological principles, considerations and characteristics, as well as latest implementations of micro-actuator based <b>tactile</b> graphic <b>displays</b> and the relative software interfaces structures and representations is presented. Fabrication technologies are reviewed in order to demonstrate the potential in tactile applications. Existing electronic Braille displays for accessibility are limited to text-based information. Graphic <b>tactile</b> <b>displays</b> enable for viewing images by the sense of touch on a reusable surface and substitution of the visual/auditory sense. Applications include education, engineering/artistic design, web surfing, and viewing of art and photographs. Tactile substitution can be used in augmenting accessibility for the blind or deaf in order to: (a) to enhance access to computer graphical user interfaces, (b) to enhance mobility in controlled environments.
