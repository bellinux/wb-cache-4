5|$|While {{public schools}} {{remained}} open during the shutdown, and teachers {{continued to be}} paid following Gearin's ruling, the shutdown interfered with their operations, and would have caused serious problems if it had continued. Teachers could not renew or receive new licenses during the shutdown, creating a backlog, and property <b>tax</b> <b>levy</b> approvals could have been delayed. No fishing, hunting, and boating licenses or new drivers' licenses were issued during the shutdown. Taxes continued to be due, but tax refunds stopped.|$|E

Based on recommendations specified by the Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the school <b>tax</b> <b>levy.</b> The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a <b>tax</b> <b>levy</b> referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1990s, {{the city}} of Black Hawk backed a {{proposal}} for a state-funded widening of Highway 119 including a tunnel that would link to I-70 one mile (1.6km) closer to Denver than Central City's off-ramp. Central City continued with its plans for a south access highway despite {{the city of}} Black Hawk acquiring land {{in the path of the}} proposed road. The issue was brought before a Denver grand jury that decided Black Hawk officials had misspent taxpayer money. Central City then sued Black Hawk for $100 million; Black Hawk countersued.

25|$|Loveland {{has seen}} several controversies over zoning regulation. After the city {{acquired}} the White Pillars property in 1996, it began plans {{to develop the}} land, which is situated on State Route 48. Prior to being elected councilman, Paul Elliot participated in {{a lawsuit against the}} city over attempting to rezone the property for commercial use without voter approval. In 2003, Mike Showler led a successful referendum to block the rezoning. An earlier attempt to develop a YMCA location on a section of Phillips Park also failed, when a group of residents protested the city's development plans, prompting the YMCA to abandon the location. In December 2006, Loveland announced a plan to build a Loveland Recreation Center on land adjacent to Phillips Park. The city planned to enter into an operating agreement with the YMCA once the center was built; however, the Recreation Center tax referendum was defeated in May 2007. The Recreation Center plan was later revised, but Loveland residents again rejected an income <b>tax</b> <b>levy</b> to fund the center on November 6, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The guard room above {{included}} an iron cell for drunks and less dangerous prisoners including women. Due to the courthouse's small size, the county needed to rent additional office space nearly immediately after completion. The building's inadequate space {{combined with a}} leaking roof would cause repairs and improvements to consume the majority of commissioners' time after 1982. In 1883, county commissioners denounced the building as too small and {{badly in need of}} repairs. After publishing an invitation for bids to construct a new, two-floor facility, they accepted one offered by Keesey due to his original land donation. One month later, after political infighting that resulted in the resignation of the county judge, all bids were then rejected. In the aftermath, the next meeting of the Commissioners Court called for a new <b>tax</b> <b>levy</b> to provide additional rooms for the jail and county clerk's office and five iron cages for upper jail cell. Although the cages were indeed installed, there is little proof that the building underwent any further expansion. In 1884, glass was installed in the windows of the clerk's office, and the sheriff was ordered to remove the water closet and fill the well in the courtyard.|$|E
