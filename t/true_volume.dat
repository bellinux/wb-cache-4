50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is {{the weight of the}} package at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of the package. The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of the package.

40|$|Objective AngioSuite was {{developed}} to allow the easy and accurate calculation of cerebral aneurysm volumes and packing densities. The present study was undertaken to validate its accuracy. Methods Mathematical models and software were created to facilitate more complex aneurysm volume calculations than previously described three-dimensional geometric models. 20 phantom aneurysm clay models were created and analyzed (length, width, depth and volume) using angiographic mathematical modeling (AngioSuite), geometric modeling (AngioCalc) and three-dimensional volume reconstructions from the vendor’s Leonardo workstation (Siemens). Results The mean volumes of all phantoms analyzed by the AngioSuite system differed from <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> {{by an average of}} 2. 2 %. Mean volumes of all phantoms analyzed by the AngioCalc system differed from <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> by an average of 11. 3 %. Mean volumes obtained from the Leonardo workstation windowed for best appearance differed by an average of 5. 18 %. Conclusions The AngioSuite software system provides an accurate means of calculating aneurysm volumes. Typical packing densities (40 % or less) are thus accurate within ± 1 %.

50|$|The cuvette {{calibration}} has a {{great effect}} on the absorbance measurement. Many variables {{need to be considered}} to ensure precision and accuracy. The spectrophotometric measurement is sensitive to the change in volume. The calibration cuvette helps scientists to convert the volume data from relative value units to the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> with the less uncertainty. The cuvette adjustment is important for laboratory technicians who acquiring a precise estimation of the volume of solution. In the laboratory facility, sometimes a round glass cuvette is frequently utilized. The adjusted cuvette that has been aligned and sold in the market is expensive in comparison with the cost of normal glass tubes. The glass cell costs approximately 30 times more than an ordinary glass tube. In turn, the cuvettes do the most appropriate sort of spectrophotometer, but in the some researches need the great number of cuvette and can be costly. A high quality glass tube as calibrated can give similar result as a cuvette. However, the manually calibrated cuvette has less consistency. The adjustment and position of the tube affect the reading value of the absorbance as the light goes through the sample controlled by the width of the cuvette. The distance traveled by light and the concentration of solution influence the estimation of absorbance. The appropriate wavelength and type of cuvette is the main component for measuring the correct absorbance with manually calibrating the cuvette.|$|E

The {{volume estimates}} keep increasing over the studied EI range, but the ‘stroke volume’ (EDV-ESV) reaches a constant after approximately 10 iterations. This explains the decreasing phenomenon in the calculated EF with QGS software (Fig.  5 a); the EDV and ESV increase, but the difference between them remains constant. In contrast, 4 DM does not alter the cardiac muscle thickness as much as QGS with higher EIs. Therefore, similar increasing volume phenomenon is not as clearly present (Fig.  5 b), and EF is more stable with high number of EIs. However, The IQ-SPECT produced systematically smaller volumes than LEHR protocol at the studied iterations range.|$|R
5000|$|Loschmidt did not {{actually}} calculate a value for the constant which now bears his name, {{but it is a}} simple and logical manipulation of his published results. James Clerk Maxwell described the paper in these terms in a public lecture eight years later:Loschmidt has deduced from the dynamical theory the following remarkable proportion:—As the volume of a gas is to the combined volume of all the molecules contained in it, so is the mean path of a molecule to one-eighth of the diameter of a molecule.To derive this [...] "remarkable proportion", Loschmidt started from Maxwell's own definition of the mean free path:where n has the same sense as the Loschmidt constant, that is the number of molecules per unit volume, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules (assumed to be spherical). This rearranges towhere 1/n is the volume occupied by each molecule in the gas phase and πℓd/4 is the volume of the cylinder made by the molecule in its trajectory between two collisions. However, the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of each molecule is given by πd/6, and so nπd/6 is the volume occupied by all the molecules not counting the empty space between them. Loschmidt equated this volume with the volume of the liquified gas. Dividing both sides of the equation by nπd/6 has the effect of introducing a factor of V/V, which Loschmidt called the [...] "condensation coefficient" [...] and which is experimentally measurable. The equation reduces to:relating the diameter of a gas molecule to measurable phenomena.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{accuracy}} of two methods used to clinically estimate testicular volume in the dog. Caliper and ultrasonographic measurements of testicular dimensions (length, width and height) of both testes were performed on 21 adult Beagles. Either measurement was taken in vivo over the scrotal skin and again in vitro after castration, excluding or including, when possible, the epididymis. In a sub-sample of 14 testes of 7 randomly selected dogs, the testicular volume was calculated by the formula of an ellipsoid: length (l) x width (w) x height (h) x 0. 5236, and the empiric formula of Lambert: (l) x (w) x (h) x 0. 71. The calculated volumes were then compared to the actual ones, which were estimated by water displacement. For each measurement method, the formula that estimated more accurately the <b>true</b> testicular <b>volume</b> was, subsequently, applied to the calculation of the testicular volume of the remaining testes. The formula of ellipsoid estimated testicular volume more accurately when in vivo and in vitro caliper measurements and in vitro ultrasound measurements were performed. The formula of Lambert estimated testicular volume more accurately when in vivo ultrasound measurements were performed. The volumes calculated from the measurements of calipers over the scrotal skin overestimated <b>true</b> <b>volumes,</b> on average, by 69 +/- 27 % (concordance correlation coefficient r(ccc) = 0. 49). By contrast, those calculated from the ultrasonography measurements were more accurate, overestimating the <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> by 17 +/- 24 % (r(ccc) = 0. 81). Therefore, ultrasonography when the formula of Lambert is used is more accurate than caliper methods for the estimation of testicular volume in clinical practice and should be the method of choice.

To evaluate a broad volume range, ultrasonically scanned volumes were compared to <b>true</b> urinary <b>volumes</b> both in surgical patients and in volunteers. After institutional approval and informed consent 60 healthy volunteers were asked not to void for as long as possible. After ultrasound measurements (BladderScan BVI 2500, Diagnostic Ultrasound, Redmond WA, U. S. A.) they voided and <b>true</b> urinary <b>volumes</b> were measured. Fifty surgical patients scheduled for procedures requiring urinary catheterisation were studied. Pre- and post-induction of anaesthesia ultrasound measurements were recorded, followed by urinary catheterisation and measurement of <b>true</b> urinary <b>volume.</b> Urine volumes were compared using Student t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank Tests (p < 0. 05).

Ultrasonic scanning underestimated the <b>true</b> urine <b>volume</b> by about 7 % over the whole volume range (17 ml to 970 ml). Underestimation was larger in females than in males (p < 0. 02).
