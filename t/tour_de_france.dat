5|$|The 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was {{the third}} edition of the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto. Following the disqualifications after the 1904 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> there were changes in the rules, {{the most important one}} being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and the rules were changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> would be decided with a points system. <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> 1904 winner Cornet would enter the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E

50|$|Jacques Augendre (b.

5|$|The 1904 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was {{the second}} <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> held from 2 to 24 July. With a route similar to its {{previous}} edition, 1903 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> winner Maurice Garin seemed to have repeated his win by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, while Hippolyte Aucouturier won {{four of the six}} stages. But the race became a victim of its own success, plagued by scandals; cyclists were accused of having taken trains during the race. Twelve cyclists, including the first four of the final classification and all stage winners, were disqualified by the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF). Henri Cornet, originally the fifth-place finisher, was awarded the victory four months after the race. The problems caused the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> to be provisionally cancelled, and subsequently the 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was run with different rules from the 1903 and 1904 edition.|$|E
5|$|The doping {{scandal in}} the 1998 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> didn't affect the team directly, but Riis, {{who was part of}} the peloton in the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> was branded a doping cheat in the Danish media in early 1999. He sold his stock in Professional Cycling Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of {{mountains in the}} <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> had also been successful. After the {{introduction of}} the Vosges in the 1905 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> in 1906 the Massif Central were climbed, followed by the Pyrenees in 1910 and the Alps in 1911.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> championship.|$|E

5|$|The initial <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> of 1903 {{had been}} a large success, and it was quickly decided to {{organize}} it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. The rules {{were the same as}} in 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not enter in just one stage, but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> cyclist.|$|E

5|$|The 1907 <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France</b> was {{the fifth}} running of the annual <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France,</b> one of cycling's Grand Tours. From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488km (2,788mi) in {{fourteen}} stages around France.

For the first time, climbs in the Western Alps {{were included in the}} <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>France.</b> The race was dominated at the start by Émile Georget, who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and Lucien Petit-Breton became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.|$|E
