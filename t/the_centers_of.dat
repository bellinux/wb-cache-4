5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s {{identified a number of}} good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} few miles in Saratoga County, I-87 runs across lightly {{developed}} {{parts of the}} towns of Halfmoon and Clifton Park. Near exit9, however, the freeway passes through the commercial center of Clifton Park as it connects to NY146. Clifton Park Center, one of several shopping plazas at the junction, is situated southwest of the exit. Past exit9, the commercial development subsides as I-87 traverses another area dominated by housing tracts. Just north of the exit, the freeway passes a rest area for northbound traffic. The freeway continues on, passing {{to the west of}} <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> Round Lake at exit11 and Malta at exit12. After Malta, I-87 turns slightly to the northeast and begins to loosely parallel the northwestern edge of Saratoga Lake as it crosses Kayaderosseras Creek and enters Saratoga Springs.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.|$|E

2500|$|For unguided rockets {{the trim}} {{position}} is typically zero angle <b>of</b> attack and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure is defined to be <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resultant flow {{field on the}} entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure in <b>the</b> limit as angle of attack goes to zero). [...] For positive stability in missiles, <b>the</b> total vehicle <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure defined as given above must {{be further from the}} nose of the vehicle than <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity.

[...] The normalized normal force coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing <b>the</b> total <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure.

5|$|Mycenaean Greece (or Mycenaean civilization) was {{the last}} phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece (c. 1600–1100 BC). It {{represents}} the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. Among <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> power that emerged, the most notable were those of Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. The most prominent site was Mycenae, in Argolid, to which the culture of this era owes its name. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor, the Levant, Cyprus and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly {{from the}} ranks of their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds dominating the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling the ranks of the infantry. These groups typically settled in the pastoral areas outside of the cities, <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of the}} 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> adjacent tiles.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the sundew genus {{stretches}} from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. <b>The</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form {{the outskirts of the}} generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous supposition, the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through continental drift. Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred {{as a result of a}} subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in Africa or Australia.|$|E
5|$|The typical average equipartition {{strength}} for spiral galaxies is about 10 μG (microGauss) or 1 nT (nanoTesla). For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss or 30 μT (microTesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M 33, our Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5 μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent spiral arms the field strength can {{be up to}} 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated. The strongest total equipartition fields (50-100 μG) were found in starburst galaxies, for example in M 82 and the Antennae, and in nuclear starburst regions, for example in <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> NGC 1097 and of other barred galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase.
