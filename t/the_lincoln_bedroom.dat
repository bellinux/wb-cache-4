5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping at the door of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> (which was used as a meeting room {{at the time of his}} administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and the Lincoln Sitting Room {{are located}} in the {{southeast}} corner of the Second Floor. As originally designed and completed in 1809, this space contained two very narrow, north-south running bedchambers with a toilet room between them.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton {{refurbished}} some {{rooms with}} the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room. During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.|$|E
500|$|In later years, {{the tunnel}} {{has been used}} by persons who needed to exit or depart the White House without public or press attention. Tricia Nixon and her husband, Edward F. Cox, {{departed}} the White House via the tunnel after their 1972 Rose Garden wedding. According to Bill Gulley, longtime head of the White House Military Office, the tunnel was used by male White House aides to sneak their girlfriends and mistresses into the building to have sexual intercourse in <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and [...] Jimmy Carter. Lyndon Johnson also used the tunnel to avoid Vietnam War protesters when departing the White House. An allegation that the White House to Treasury Building tunnel was used by Bill Clinton to facilitate extramarital liaisons has been discredited.|$|E

500|$|During the {{administration}} Howe's official title was Secretary to the President, a role {{equivalent to the}} current White House Chief of Staff posting. After FDR's inauguration, Howe took up residence in <b>the</b> White House <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> Howe described his role in {{the administration}} as the president's [...] "no-man", checking Roosevelt's natural enthusiasm and preventing unsound proposals from reaching wider discussion. He was also a strong supporter of the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the many public works programs of Roosevelt's [...] "New Deal". Howe persuaded the Governor of Kentucky to name him an honorary colonel, echoing the name of President Wilson's famous advisor, Colonel House; later, Howe printed business cards containing all his nicknames, reading: [...] "Colonel Louis Rasputin Voltaire Talleyrand Simon Legree Howe".|$|R

50|$|President Truman was the {{individual}} who conceived of dedicating the space to Lincoln.

The sitting room furnishings were all purchased by First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. They include four mahogany chairs, a chest in the late Empire style, and red and gold rugs and drapes. The small mahogany desk in the sitting room was constructed by James Hoban himself. <b>The</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and Sitting Room were redecorated by First Lady Laura Bush, who changed the decor so it more accurately reflected tastes common during the American Civil War. <b>The</b> <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> is usually used to house close friends of the President who are visiting the White House.|$|E
