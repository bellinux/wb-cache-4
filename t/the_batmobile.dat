5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, {{eliminating}} the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile,</b> such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to}} the player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Batmobile</b> has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E

5|$|When Catwoman rejects Cobblepot's advances, he attacks {{her with}} his {{helicopter}} umbrella. Fleeing the police, Batman realizes that Cobblepot is remotely controlling <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile,</b> taking it on a rampage through Gotham. Batman records the Penguin's insults about how gullible the Gotham citizens are and disables the device.|$|E
5|$|While {{planning}} a stunt with <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> {{in a special}} effects facility near Chertsey, England in September 2007, technician Conway Wickliffe was killed when his car crashed. The film is dedicated to both Ledger and Wickliffe. The restaurant scene was filmed at the Criterion Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus, London.|$|E
5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, <b>The</b> <b>Batmobile</b> was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
2500|$|During the [...] "" [...] storyline, it is {{revealed}} that Batman has hidden {{a number of}} spare vehicles across the city just in case. A Humvee serves as a primary mean of transportation to cross the earthquake-ravaged city during the Aftershock storyline, as most of <b>the</b> <b>Batmobiles</b> are wrecked by the quake. These vehicles are not as sophisticated as <b>the</b> <b>Batmobiles,</b> {{but some of them}} are armored to withstand weaponry mounted on military automobile prototypes.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> 2008 book <b>Batmobile</b> Owner's Manual, gives {{theoretical}} specifications {{of the car}} {{as if it were}} a real car. The book {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to [...]|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Bob Butts (with George Barris' consent) made {{replicas of}} <b>the</b> <b>Batmobiles.</b> He {{took one of}} <b>the</b> Barris-built replica <b>Batmobiles</b> and made a mold of it. Based on {{pictures}} from when the Futura was shown in the 1950s, he reskinned an existing Batmobile replica back into a Lincoln Futura replica. He only created one copy.|$|R
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> as a playable vehicle, {{which is used}} for transportation, puzzle solving and combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure than previous titles in the series, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile.</b> He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{designs for}} the {{standard}} Batmobile include ones based on the 1960s TV series; a prototype version; 1970s Batman-themed; Robin-themed; Riddler-themed; and Rocksteady-themed. All-new, drivable Batmobiles include: the 1989 film, Tumbler, 1960s TV series, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and the original Arkham Asylum Batmobiles. These Batmobiles do not feature a tank mode and can only {{be used in the}} main game after all tanks have been eliminated or on specific Batmobile challenge maps. In terms of design, the 1989 film and 1960 TV series ones are longer and narrower with better handling than the standard Arkham Knight Batmobile. Racetracks for <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> include two based on Batman and Batman Returns; two based on The Dark Knight; two based on the 1960s TV series; and two WayneTech tracks.|$|E
500|$|Kevin VanOrd, {{writing for}} GameSpot, awarded the game a 7 out of 10, praising the game's [...] "terrific" [...] amount of variety, its {{improvement}} of past games' elements, the cleverness of the game's puzzles, and the [...] "Dual Play" [...] mechanics. VanOrd reacted positively to the segments involving <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> Battle mode, {{calling it a}} [...] "delight", and called the vehicle's driving [...] "slick and satisfying". However, VanOrd found fault {{with some of the}} game's logic, particularly the clash between Batman's no-kill rule and <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> significant propensity for destruction. He also noted how the story's thematic elements and repeated metaphors became exhaustingly redundant, mentioning its [...] "ham-fisted storytelling" [...] and describing the game overall as [...] "only as good as the world allows it to be." [...] Sam Roberts from GamesRadar noted the game's satisfying cinematic value, particularly moments in which it felt like Batman: The Animated Series. However, Roberts did reserve some criticisms, calling some of <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> additions [...] "slippery" [...] and deemed it a [...] "mixed affair"; the campaign was described as full of [...] "generally wonky storytelling, sometimes hammy dialogue and unconvincing duo of primary villains." [...] Roberts praised the [...] "gorgeous" [...] open world and its side missions as [...] "almost universally fantastic", finding fault with the Firefly missions among others. <b>The</b> Riddler's <b>Batmobile</b> racetracks were considered [...] "beyond silly," [...] though he still commended the character for his increased involvement in the story.|$|R
50|$|It was one {{of several}} famous {{television}} show cars of the era, including <b>the</b> original <b>Batmobile,</b> <b>the</b> Monkeemobile, and the Munster Koach, and one of many radical contemporary custom cars, such as Red Baron.|$|R
25|$|Battle Mode {{transforms}} <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> appearance into a tank-like form; widening its {{suspension and}} its LED headlights go from blue to red. In battle mode a remote controlled turret {{rises from the}} top of the vehicle with an array of weapons for anti armor, anti air and non-lethal anti personnel.|$|R
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying it seemed like the optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential side effects) and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The console {{versions}} of Arkham Knight received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its narrative, visuals, gameplay, combat, and world designs, with most criticism {{given to the}} emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile.</b> The Windows version, however, {{became the subject of}} intense criticism due to major performance problems, even on high-end graphics hardware, prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw it from sale. Upon its release, the game was the fastest selling game of 2015, and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015. Rocksteady released additional content for the game, including story-driven missions, challenge maps, and skins for Batman and his allies, as well as new Batmobiles from Batman's history and custom racetracks for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>the</b> {{contemporary}} <b>Batmobile</b> {{was destroyed}} in [...] "KnightsEnd", <b>the</b> original <b>Batmobile</b> (with <b>the</b> large hood ornament) was used by Batman and Robin for several issues following. [...] "Knightquest" [...] also introduces Batman's rocket railcar linking the Batcave to the Gotham subway system; it was designed and completed by Harold after his discovery of the cavern passages in Detective Comics #650 ("The Dragon").|$|R

5000|$|Development for Batman {{started in}} 2011 at Specular Interactive and they worked with Warner Brothers to build all of <b>the</b> <b>Batmobiles</b> and <b>the</b> Gotham City environment. According to Steve Ranck, the Specular Interactive team {{spent a lot}} of time {{building}} Gotham City, which in this game [...] "is nearly 10 square miles of various suburbs, unique neighborhoods, elevation changes, tunnels, bridges, hills, dirt roads, jumps, secret paths, etc.|$|R
25|$|Batman {{subsequently}} {{comes to}} the aid of Black Canary, who is fighting a group of thugs. After defeating the criminals, the two masked crimefighters share a romantic interlude, before Batman takes Canary home, with Vanzetti bound and gagged in <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> trunk. Batman and Dick manage to force from Jocko-Boy the name of the person who hired him: the Joker. Dick wants to fight crime with Batman, but Batman says he needs a secret identity.|$|R
5000|$|Just as the Riddler {{finishes}} his question, Dick shows up and knocks Conundrum out. Riddler then {{admits that he}} is completely baffled that Batman is indeed there, since he was only stalling for time until he thought of something, leading him to wonder if there truly is a Batsignal in his cane (a panel during Riddler's [...] "bluff" [...] shows that there is indeed a Batsignal in his cane, as a green question mark alongside a map shows up inside <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile's</b> window).|$|R

25|$|An {{episode of}} The Simpsons guest-starred Adam West with <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile.</b> Another episode {{featured}} <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> {{in a museum}} of famous cars next to Herbie the Love Bug and a car from Mad Max. The latter episode featured a live Batman and Robin in the vehicle, who had both tried poorly to conceal {{the fact that they}} were not dummies.|$|E
25|$|In , a {{different}} version of <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> retains its classic-shape and designs; but is {{heavily influenced by}} The Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler. The car is heavier than a tank, its ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected anything it collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of {{feet in the air}} to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on <b>the</b> <b>Batmobile</b> from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from the 1960 TV Series and the films appear as DLC and are used in special Racing AR Challenges.|$|E
