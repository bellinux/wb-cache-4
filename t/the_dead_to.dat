5|$|By 2003, around 1,044casts {{made from}} {{impressions}} of {{bodies in the}} ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100. The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980). What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the total number at risk remain completely unknown.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> <b>To</b> make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> <b>to</b> thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E

5|$|The {{dead man}} is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes {{that this is}} a Seneca ritual aimed at {{reviving}} <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. When Black returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies {{of the end of the}} world.|$|E

Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> speak to the living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|While the Picts and Scots {{would have}} {{remained}} pagan, most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after {{the departure of}} the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves and retreated as the Anglo-Saxons advanced north. Their gods included Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the afterlife. However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E

5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>to</b> join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland can {{probably}} be {{found among the}} soldiers and ordinary Roman citizens {{in the vicinity of}} Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the 4th century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) which existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians. After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the afterlife.

5|$|Tunjos (from Muysccubun: tunxo) {{are small}} votive {{offering}} figures produced in great quantities by the Muisca. They {{are found in}} various places on the Altiplano, mainly in lakes and rivers, and {{are the most common}} object housed in museum collections outside Colombia. The word tunjo was used first in the literature about the Muisca in 1854, by scholar Ezequiel Uricoechea. The figurines are mostly anthropomorphic with other examples being zoomorphic. The tunjos were mostly elaborated using tumbaga; an alloy of gold, copper and silver, some with traces of lead or iron. The majority of ceramic or stone tunjos has been described from Mongua, close to Sogamoso. The tunjos served three purposes; as decoration of temples and shrines, for offering rituals in the sacred lakes and rivers in the Muisca religion, and as pieces in funerary practices; to accompany <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the afterlife. Ceramic human Tunjos were kept in the houses (bohíos) of the Muisca, together with emeralds.|$|E

5|$|Undead Nightmare is a {{modified}} {{expansion of the}} 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western action-adventure in which the former outlaw John Marston is coerced {{by the federal government}} to capture former members of his gang in exchange for his family's freedom. Undead Nightmare is an alternate timeline expansion that adds a new full-length story in a zombie horror theme and reworks the base game's environment to appear dark and spooky. As corpses begin to rise from <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> become flesh-eating zombies, some of the living go into hiding and others become hostile. Marston seeks to find the plague's cause and its cure for his wife and son. The game's story lasts about six hours and includes new cutscenes, voice acting, and music. It is accessed separately from the main game menu with its own save files. It does not share play progress and items from the main game, nor does it require the base game in any form.|$|E
5|$|When {{they face}} Orphan, despite the party's pleas for Fang to not {{transform}} into Ragnarok, Fang eventually transforms into an incomplete version and fights the fal'Cie alone, but gets tortured {{as a result}} of her failure, only to be saved by Lightning's group. After Orphan's destruction, Fang and Vanille complete their Focus by becoming Ragnarok to save Cocoon from crashing into Gran Pulse. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Fang and Vanille appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in, and at the end they are rescued from Cocoon's pillar when it finally collapse. By the events of Lightning Returns, after awakening and seeing Vanille being used by the Order, Fang has taken up residence in the Dead Dunes and becomes the leader of a bandit group bent on thwarting the Order from obtaining a relic within the desert. She attempts to destroy the relic so Vanille can be saved from being killed by the ritual. Fang appears on the final day, helping Lightning dissuade Vanille from going through with the ritual and helps her guide the souls of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>to</b> the new world.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>to</b> rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
