30|$|According to the Federal Holidays Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz), {{the minimum}} {{entitlement}} to paid recreational holiday is 20 working {{days per year}} based on a five-day work week. Many collective or individual agreements, however, include more favourable regulations. Overall, the annual leave entitlement for workers covered by collective agreements in Germany is six weeks per year (cf. Schnitzlein 2011). The Collective Agreement Archive of the WSI reports this collectively agreed annual paid holiday leave of employees, distinguishing basic and actual <b>total</b> <b>leave</b> by industries.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Iraqi Kurdistan region in January 2014 to determine the individual leaf area of oleander (Nerium oleander L.) by easy, accurate, inexpensive, and nondestructive method. Simple, multiple and exponential regression analyses were used by length (L) and width (W) and their combinations as independent variables and with leaf area as dependent variable to determine more accurate models (high coefficient of determination and less MSE). The results showed that the best fitting models that show more accurate estimation of oleander leaf area, compared to other models, were the simple linear regression that depends on length multiple width for Koya and Erbil cities and the <b>total</b> <b>leaves</b> of the two cities plants. On the other hand, the best fitting multiple linear equations were those which depend on square length and square width for Koya city and the <b>total</b> <b>leaves</b> of the two cities plants, whereas for Erbil city the best model was that depends on leaves with square length and width. Multiple linear regressions were the more accurate among the models, followed by simple linear regression, whereas the exponential model had the lowest accuracy.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) wild {{relatives}} {{remain a}} largely untapped potential for genetic improvement. However, the domestication syndrome phenomena from wild species to cultivated cassava remain poorly understood. The analysis of leaf anatomy and photosynthetic activity showed significantly different between cassava cultivars SC 205, SC 8 and wild relative M. esculenta ssp. Flabellifolia (W 14). The dry matter, starch and amylose contents {{in the storage}} roots of cassava cultivars were significantly more than that in wild species. In order to further reveal the differences in photosynthesis and starch accumulation of cultivars and wild species, the globally differential proteins between cassava SC 205, SC 8 and W 14 were analyzed using 2 -DE in combination with MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 175 and 304 proteins in <b>leaves</b> and <b>storage</b> roots were identified, respectively. Of these, 122 and 127 common proteins in <b>leaves</b> and <b>storage</b> roots were detected in SC 205, SC 8 and W 14, respectively. There were 11, 2 and 2 unique proteins in leaves, as well as 58, 9 and 12 unique proteins in storage roots for W 14, SC 205 and SC 8, respectively, indicating proteomic changes in <b>leaves</b> and <b>storage</b> roots between cultivated cassava and its wild relatives. These proteins and their differential regulation across plants of contrasting leaf morphology, leaf anatomy pattern and photosynthetic related parameters and starch content could contribute to the footprinting of cassava domestication syndrome.
