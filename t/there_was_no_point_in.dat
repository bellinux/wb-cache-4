5|$|Lord Runciman {{continued}} his work, attempting {{to pressure the}} Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> hiding it from them.|$|E

On 12 September, the Allied war council deliberating in Abbeville, France concluded that the Polish military campaign had already been resolved and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> launching an anti-German relief expedition. The Polish leaders were unaware of the decision and still expected a Western offensive.|$|E

500|$|According to Mason, Coleridge decided <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> {{relying on}} a {{prosecution}} under the Act, which he regarded as deliberately obstructive. Instead he gave an angry speech about the dog on 1 May 1903 to {{the annual meeting of}} the National Anti-Vivisection Society at St James's Hall in Piccadilly, attended by 2,000–3,000 people. Mason writes that support and apologies for absence were sent by writers Jerome K. Jerome, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling. Coleridge accused the scientists of torture: [...] "If this is not torture, let Mr. Bayliss and his friends... tell us in Heaven's name what torture is.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the mint}} {{had given the}} twenty-cent piece a smooth rim, rather than the reeded one on the quarter, the two pieces were {{immediately}} confused. At , the twenty-cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at , and the two pieces had near-identical obverses. Mistakes in change-making were widespread, and the twenty-cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular. [...] In April 1876, when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin, the twenty-cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low-denomination paper. Nevertheless, in July, legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty-cent piece. [...] Although the bill did not pass immediately, according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece, the pendency of the bill convinced the mint that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> striking further twenty-cent pieces. The mintage for 1876 was low (coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City), and only proof specimens were coined in 1877 and 1878, at Philadelphia. Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the Centennial Exposition.|$|E
500|$|In British Archaeology magazine, Aston was {{described}} as [...] "the Mortimer Wheeler of our times" [...] because, despite strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. It went on to note that Aston reminded archaeologists that [...] "their job is to do archaeology, and if that was an archaeology that meant nothing to ordinary people, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> it – and government would {{be among the first}} to notice." [...] Two of Aston's colleagues from Bristol University, Stuart Prior and Mark Horton, commented that [...] "Mick brought archaeology into the living rooms of half the nation, and left a legacy that will shape the discipline for decades to come." [...] Writing for the website of Antiquity, Christopher Gerrard described him as [...] "perhaps the best known face in British archaeology", adding that [...] "in so many different areas of medieval archaeology his legacy will live on". Emma McFarnon described Aston as [...] "Somerset's premier archaeologist" [...] in her obituary on the This is Somerset website.|$|E

The show's creator, Josh Schwartz, promised this season would be different, saying it would [...] "focus on [...] core characters and their relationships". He added that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> worrying about ratings and that he [...] "wanted to get the show back to an earlier place, try to get back to some of the humor and heart of the show that maybe wasn't as evident last year". The season was released on DVD as a five-disc boxed set under the title The O.C.: The Complete Fourth Season on May 22, 2007 by Warner Bros. Home Video. The season was also made available in the American versions of Zune and iTunes Store. Before the season premiered on television, it was available through on demand streaming. In the US, streaming was available from October 26, 2006 at 3:01a.m. ET onwards, through Fox Interactive Media's MySpace and MyFoxLocal stations.|$|E
500|$|The two-seat trainer had the {{internal}} OKB designations of I-301T and izdeliye FT {{and the first}} prototype was converted {{from one of the}} [...] "parade" [...] aircraft during 1946. Its fuel capacity had to be reduced by one third {{to make room for the}} second tandem cockpit. Dual controls were fitted as was an intercom to allow the instructor and student to communicate in the air. Each man had an ejection seat designed after that used by the Germans in their Heinkel He 162 fighter. This aircraft was delivered on 17 January 1947, although flight testing was not completed until 5 April. The ejection seats were not tested in the air, but they required extensive testing on the ground to ensure the proper operation of the seat. State acceptance trials were not completed until 2 June and the aircraft was rejected because of the poor visibility from the rear cockpit. A second aircraft was completed on 15 July and the visibility from the rear cockpit was improved by replacing the original bulletproof windscreen with a larger glass plate, reshaping the canopy's side panels, and removing a partition between the cockpits. This aircraft was fitted with air brakes in the wings and two [...] drop tanks hung under its wingtips. It passed its state acceptance trials later in 1947 and was recommended for production with the service designation of UTI MiG-9. The ejection seats were extensively tested during 1948 and approved for use, but by this time the aircraft was deemed obsolete and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> building a training version.|$|E

However, in her research for the critical edition, Hansell notes that in 1856 Verdi angrily withdrew his opera from circulation, reusing parts of the score for his reworked 1857 version, the libretto also [...] prepared by Piave: it was renamed as Aroldo and set in 13th century Anglo-Saxon England and Scotland.

[...] Even though the outbreak was in steep decline by the time of Lukwiya's death, it sent shockwaves through the health sector.
