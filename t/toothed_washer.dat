50|$|Some rotary {{switches}} are user configurable {{in relation to}} the number of positions. A special <b>toothed</b> <b>washer</b> that sits below the holding nut can be positioned so that the tooth is inserted into {{one of a number of}} slots in a way that limits the number of positions available for selection. For example, if only four positions are required on a twelve position switch, the washer can be positioned so that only four switching positions can be selected when in use.|$|E
50|$|A {{push nut}} resembles a <b>toothed</b> <b>washer,</b> {{commonly}} fabricated in metal. These are installed by pressing onto {{the end of}} a grooved shaft, until the nut's inner teeth snap into the groove. The use of push nuts avoids the cost of threading a nut onto the end of the shaft during the manufacturing process. However, a push nut once installed is normally destroyed in the removal process, which potentially prevents removal of mechanisms captive to the shaft for replacement or servicing without having the correct replacement push nut on hand—if the part number and specification for the push nut is even known—and possibly also requires a specialized pressing tool to conform with manufacturer's guidance.|$|E
