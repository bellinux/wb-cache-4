In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery <b>to</b> <b>uses</b> as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{demonstration of the}} proposed model enabled to identify predictors that determine intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Social influence has {{significant impact on the}} study participants’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. As social influence <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism increases, the behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it also increases. There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful. The finding also showed significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. That means tourism organizations are motivated <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICTs when such technologies are easy <b>to</b> <b>use</b> letting them <b>to</b> have more time for other activities. There was significant association between cost effectiveness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Cost-effective ICT facilities are more preferable by tourism organizations. Moreover, there is significant relationship between competitive advantage and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. This suggests that users’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism increases when they believe that the technology will improve their competitive advantages over their counter parts. Besides, the research illustrated significant association between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Tourism organizations’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT increases when facilitating conditions such as users’ experience, resources, and background ICT skill increases.|$|R

500|$|The Lord Chancellor had, {{since the}} 15th century, been tasked with {{administering}} estates where the estate {{was to be}} used for charitable purposes. In Bailiff of Burford v Lenthall, Lord Hardwicke suggested that the jurisdiction of the Court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts, {{as well as from the}} Charitable Uses Act 1601. Carne suggests that, as the Court had long been able to deal with such situations, the 1601 act was actually just the declaration of pre-existing custom. This is illustrated by the Chancellor's original jurisdiction over feoffments <b>to</b> <b>uses,</b> which came from his original status as a clergyman, as charity had been originally enforced by the Church and the ecclesiastical courts. Essentially, an owner of land could dispose of it by granting the right to use it and collect fees to another, not just by selling it. This was not valid at the common law courts but was in the Court of Chancery; the Lord Chancellor is reported as having said, in 1492, [...] "where there is no remedy at common law there may be good remedy in conscience, as, for example, by a feoffment upon confidence, the feoffor has no remedy by common law, and yet by conscience he has; and so, if the feoffee transfers to another who knows of this confidence, the feoffor, by means of a subpoena, will have his rights in this Court". After the reign of Edward IV, if the charitable land were to be sold (or land were to be sold to create the charity) the Court of Chancery was the only place this could be done, as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction.|$|E

2500|$|Following World War II, {{the sales}} and {{popularity}} of Champagne surged once more. Since 1950, sales have grown steadily, quadrupling in total to over 200 million bottles. The increase in worldwide demand has prompted the French authorities {{to look into}} expanding the region's AOC zone to facilitate more production. There still exist the business dynamic between vine growers and Champagne houses with majority of the region's 19,000 growers selling their grapes to the nearly 300 Champagne houses in production. Over time Champagne has become not only {{a reflection of the}} terroir of the Champagne region but also a brand in itself, with the Champenois vigorously defending that brand and the uses of the term [...] "Champagne". The popularity and success of Champagne has inspired many imitators around the world (such as Cava in Spain, Sekt in Germany and several American sparklers) but also within France itself with sparkling Cremants. The name [...] "Champagne" [...] is a protected designation of origin in the European Union and all wines produced and sold in the EU must conform to those standards and not label a wine as [...] "Champagne" [...] unless it comes from the Champagne AOC (in the United States there is a legal loophole for semi-generic terms).
