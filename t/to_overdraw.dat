The success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is attributed by Brian Bell to the following factors: Accountability through a Board of four directors with Tuvalu in the chair and the other original parties providing members; the use of Professional funds management to provide investment advice; the monitoring of the performance of the fund by actuarial consultants (the Fund Monitor); the auditing of the fund by international auditors; and an advisory committee to monitor Tuvalu's economic performance and provide advice to the Government and the Board.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of rasterization-based rendering on current GPUs strongly {{depends on the}} abilities <b>to</b> avoid <b>overdraw</b> and <b>to</b> prevent rendering triangles smaller than the pixel size. Otherwise, the rates at which highresolution polygon models can be displayed are affected significantly. Instead of trying to build these abilities into the rasterization-based rendering pipeline, we propose an alternative rendering pipeline implementation that uses rasterization and ray-casting in every frame simultaneously to determine eye-ray intersections. To make ray-casting competitive with rasterization, we introduce a memory-efficient sample-based data structure which gives rise to an efficient ray traversal procedure. In combination with a regular model subdivision, the most optimal rendering technique can be selected at run-time for each part. For very large triangle meshes our method can outperform pure rasterization and requires a considerably smaller memory budget on the GPU. Since the proposed data structure can be constructed from any renderable surface representation, {{it can also be}} used to efficiently render isosurfaces in scalar volume fields. The compactness of the data structure allows rendering from GPU memory when alternative techniques already require exhaustive paging...|$|R

40|$|Visibility {{testing is}} an {{integral}} part of many computer graphics algorithms. For example, algorithms that generate images with shadows, ambient occlusion, environment lighting or transparency all require an efficient means of establishing the visibility between two or more points in a virtual scene. Algorithms designed for interactive applications, in particular, require these queries to be very fast and highly parallelizable. This thesis is based on six papers that present a number of novel algorithms which perform efficient visibility testing in virtual scenes in order to generate high quality images at interactive frame rates. The two most famous algorithms for shadows are shadow maps and shadow volumes. Shadow maps can only approximate the result, while shadow volumes are typically fill-rate limited due <b>to</b> huge <b>overdraw.</b> The first paper in this thesis modifies the shadow map algorithm to be exact per view sample and extends it to handle area or volumetric light sources. The second paper shows how <b>to</b> overcome the <b>overdraw</b> problems inherent in the shadow volume algorithm and extends it to support textured and transparent shadow casters in real time for complex geometry with no restrictions on topology. The three papers that follow focus on rendering of transparent geometry with shadows. The first of these describes a method for approximately sorting primitives to improve the speed at which alpha blending and opacity mapping can be used to render hair. Then, a method is described with which visibility functions can be generated and stored efficiently in a fixed size texture. We show how the equations for alpha blending transparent geometry can be expressed in such a way that the order in which the terms are accumulated is not important (given that the visibility between two points on a view ray can be established). Finally, we present an algorithm that provides a unified approach to estimate order independent transparency, transparent shadows and antialiasing. The final paper considers shadows in participating media and suggests a very simple to implement algorithm which can generate images with single-scattering and volumetric shadows at very high frame rates...|$|R

Blood transfusions have {{the risk of}} incompatibility and transfusion reactions as well as viral infections. Also, blood transfusions are costly and add to parental anxiety. The best treatment in prevention is minimizing the amount of blood drawn from the infant. It is found that since blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is {{the primary cause of}} anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of life, we quantified blood lost attributable <b>to</b> phlebotomy <b>overdraw,</b> something that might be avoided. A study was done to see when and if overdraw was a problem.

Infants were classified by weight into 3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty collection container from that of the container filled with blood. They found that the mean volume of blood drawn for the 578 tests exceeded that requested by the hospital laboratory by 19.0% ± 1.8% per test. The main factors of overdraw was: collection in blood containers without fill-lines, lighter weight infants and critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU.|$|R
5000|$|For a top-of-the-line, {{and rather}} {{expensive}} card ($399 USD), the Matrox Parhelia's 3D gaming performance was well behind NVIDIA's older and similarly priced GeForce 4 Ti 4600. The Parhelia was only competitive {{with the older}} Radeon 8500 and GeForce 3, which typically cost half as much. The Parhelia's potent performance was held back by its comparatively low GPU clock speed (220 MHz for retail model, 200 MHz for OEM and 256 MB models), initially believed by many commentators {{to be due to}} the large (for that time-frame) transistor total. However, ATI's Radeon 9700 was released later that year, with a considerably larger transistor count (108 million vs. 80 million), on the same 150 nm chip fabrication process, yet managed a substantially higher clock (325 MHz vs. 250 MHz). The card's fillrate performance was formidable in games that used many texture layers; though equipped with just 4 pixel pipelines, each had 4 texture units. This, unfortunately, proved not to be an efficient arrangement in most situations. Parhelia was also hampered by poor bandwidth conserving technologies/techniques; ATI introduced their 3rd gen HyperZ in Radeon 9700, NVIDIA touted Lightning Memory Architecture 2 for the GeForce 4 series, Matrox had no similarly comprehensive optimization approach.

5000|$|A {{direct debit}} or direct {{withdrawal}} is a financial transaction {{in which one}} person withdraws funds from another person's bank account. Formally, the person who directly draws the funds ("the payee") instructs his or her bank to collect (i.e., debit) an amount directly from another's ("the payer's") bank account designated by the payer and pay those funds into a bank account designated by the payee. Before the payer's banker will allow the transaction to take place, the payer must have advised the bank {{that he or she}} has authorized the payee to directly draw the funds. It is also called pre-authorized debit (PAD) or pre-authorized payment (PAP). After the authorities are set up, the direct debit transactions are usually processed electronically. Direct debits are typically used for recurring payments, such as credit card and utility bills, where the payment amounts vary from one payment to another. However, when the authorization is in place, the circumstances in which the funds are drawn as well as the dates and amounts are a matter of agreement between the payee and payer, with which the bankers are not concerned. In countries where setting up authorization is easy enough, direct debits can also be used for irregular payments, such as for mail order transactions or at a point of sale. The payer can cancel the authorization for a direct debit at any time, and the banker can decline to carry out a debit if the transaction would breach the terms of the bank account out of which payment is to be made, for example if it were to cause the account <b>to</b> <b>overdraw.</b> (Banking law does not authorize a bank to alter the payment amount.) ...|$|E

Despite regulatory interventions and heated debate between proponents and opponents of further intervention, little research has been conducted to understand the overdraft behavior of prepaid cardholders. This paper attempts to fill that gap by analyzing a large micro-level dataset of general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cardholders. We find that a small percentage of GPR prepaid cardholders regularly make overdraft transactions and incur overdraft fees, but they tend to spend and load more funds on their card as well as use their card {{for a longer period of}} time than do cardholders who do not make overdraft transactions. Our results suggest that some cardholders may be making a deliberate decision <b>to</b> <b>overdraw</b> their account and pay overdraft fees...|$|E
40|$|Splatting photons onto primary view samples, {{rather than}} {{gathering}} from a photon acceleration structure, {{can be a}} more efficient approach to evaluating the photon-density estimate in interactive applications, where the number of photons is often low compared {{to the number of}} view samples.

In this paper, we show how dynamic real-time diffuse interreflection can be achieved by using a full 3 D acceleration structure built over the view samples and then splatting photons onto the view samples by traversing this data structure. Full dynamic lighting and scenes are possible by tracing and splatting photons, and rebuilding the acceleration structure every frame. We show that the number of view-sample/photon tests can be significantly reduced and suggest further culling techniques based on the normal cone of each node in the hierarchy. Finally, we present an approximate variant of our algorithm where photon traversal is stopped at a fixed level of our hierarchy, and the incoming radiance is accumulated per node and direction, rather than per view sample. This improves performance significantly with little visible degradation of quality...|$|E

This review began with a field hearing held in Birmingham, Alabama in January 2012. Both at the field hearing {{and in response to}} a subsequent request for information, the CFPB heard from consumers who use these products. On one hand, some consumers provided favorable responses about the speed at which these loans are given,the availability of these loans for some consumers who may not qualify for other credit products, and consumers' ability to use these loans as a way <b>to</b> avoid <b>overdrawing</b> a deposit account or paying a bill late. On the other hand, consumers raised concerns such as the risk of being unable to repay the loan while still having enough money left over for other expenses,the high cost of the loan, and aggressive debt collection practices in the case of delinquency or default. These discussions and submissions underscore the importance of undertaking a data-driven analysis of the use of these products and the longer-term outcomes that borrowers experience. Because Congress authorized the CFPB to supervise both depository and non-depository institutions, over the past year {{we have been able to}} obtain data from a number of market participants that offer either deposit advance products or payday loans.

In order <b>to</b> cope with <b>overdrawing</b> and cluttering, we introduce a new four-level method of focus+context visualization. Based on a setting of coordinated, multiple views (with linking and brushing), we integrate three different kinds of focus and also the context in every single view.

We present a color compositing scheme which is capable of expressing all three values in a meaningful way, taking semantics and their relations amongst each other (in the context of our multiple linked view setup) into account. Furthermore, we present additional image-based postprocessing methods to enhance the visualization of large sets of function graphs, including a texture-based technique based on line integral convolution (LIC). We also propose advanced brushing techniques which are specific to the timedependent nature of the data (in order to brush patterns over time more efficiently).

40|$|Public sector {{procurement}} annually adds up {{to large}} sums of money, in total perhaps up towards 20 percent of GDP. The present report focuses procurement of complex products such as new roads. More specifically, the projects have three characteristics in common: They are costly to build; they have a long expected service life; {{and the quality of}} the resulting road has consequences for the costs for future users as well as society at large. A datum for the report is the problems of the construction industry with respect <b>to</b> cost <b>overdraws,</b> late delivery and poor productivity growth. The hypothesis under discussion in the report is that this at least partly may be explained by the standard way of contracting in the industry, often referred to as Design-Bid-Build (DBB). It is argued that this contract format is excessively rigid, giving entrepreneurs little leeway for cost savings. This traditional way to contract is contrasted against the current development in the industry to test more flexible contracting formats. While the public sector principal uses a consultant for the detailed planning under the traditional DBB format, Design-Build (DB) contracts give the contractor control of both planning and construction. This is a first step to hand over control to the entrepreneur. Performance contracts enhance DB by extending the contract period to include a number of years where the builder also is made responsible for the facility's maintenance. This bundling of construction and maintenance generates further scope for considering alternative tradeoffs between the costs expended on investment and maintenance, respectively. This would be welfare enhancing if the procurer is able to specify quality to be delivered in a way which captures consequences for users and society at large in an appropriate way. Finally, Public Private Partnerships are here defined to be a performance contract where the contractor is also made responsible for funding the construction. Costs can be repaid in different ways, for instance by way of down payments from the public sector principal during the contract period. It is argued that this first and foremost is a way to increase the builder's commitment to the long-term contract which is being signed...|$|R

40|$|A "payday loan" is a {{short-term}} loan made for seven to 30 days {{for a small}} amount. Fees charged on payday loans generally range from $ 15 to $ 30 on each $ 100 advanced. A typical example would be that {{in exchange for a}} $ 300 advance until the next payday, the borrower writes a post-dated check for $ 300 and receives $ 255 in cash [...] the lender taking a $ 45 fee off the top. The lender then holds on to the check until the following payday, before depositing it in its own account. When the fee for {{a short-term}} payday loan is translated into an annual percentage rate, the implied annual interest rate ranges between 400 and 1000 percent. Virtually no payday loan outlets existed 15 years ago; today, there are more payday loan and check cashing stores nationwide than there are McDonald's, Burger King, Sears, J. C.

For economists, several interesting issues arise in the study of payday loans: Is this just a situation in which willing customers and firms interact in the market for ready access to high-cost, short-term credit? Or does the payday loan industry encourage habitual borrowing and the snowballing of unaffordable debt {{in such a way that}} the state has a role to play in limiting consumers from their own excesses?

40|$|Prepaid {{products}} {{can become an}} effective instrument for banking the poor, {{as they can be}} used for collecting microdeposits and so operate as a low-cost account. Prepaid platforms have characteristics that make them especially useful for developing low-cost microfinance business models. Indeed, customers using prepaid systems do not need bank accounts or debit or credit cards. Prepaid issuers do not need to develop or invest in new technologies, as this mechanism can be used on a range of platforms, including PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Furthermore, prepaid products are specially designed for offering services demanded by the poor, such as micropayments, microdeposits and even microcredits. Lastly, they allow users to monitor their cash flow by receiving statements (some providers offer this feature online, others provide physical statements) or accessing balances through PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Besides collecting microdeposits, prepaid products (or SVCs as they are called in the United States) offer other services that can be very valuable for serving the unbanked population. As explained in this paper, prepaid products generally lack the identification and credit requirements that effectively bar millions of individuals from opening traditional bank accounts, especially in the United States. Moreover, prepaid {{products can}} be purchased and reloaded at a growing number of locations other than bank branches, such as check cashers, convenience stores and other retailers. Prepaid instruments can also provide immediate availability of funds at a cost that, in some cases, is lower than other alternatives for unbanked consumers. Also, prepaid products are difficult <b>to</b> <b>overdraw,</b> thus reducing the likelihood of unexpected fees.

40|$|An {{overdraft}} is a lending instrument, usually {{offered by}} banks, {{that for a}} predetermined period allows the borrower <b>to</b> <b>overdraw</b> his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is {{at the discretion of}} the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks is predominantly by overdrafts and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of business borrowers. The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by overdraft is determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of business borrowers (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft utilisation ratios in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets. ...|$|E

The borrower pays interest on the credit he uses, which is determined by him up to the maximum allowable. In such a system, the lender faces uncertainty from two sources. First, when the credit limit is established there is uncertainty as to how much credit will actually be used during the life of the credit arrangement. This is significant to the lender because he may have to find cash to cover unexpected fluctuations in realised usage of the credit line. Second, there is uncertainty concerning the borrower’s ability to replay the overdraft loan plus interest when the overdraft contracts terminates. This is the default risk issue that is commonly addressed in the context of fixed loans. There are in effect two distinct demands for credit in an overdraft or line of credit system. First, there is the demand for the credit limit that is available in all contingencies and which is independent of the second demand, which is the actual drawing against the credit limit. This leads quite naturally to two concepts of credit rationing with overdraft, which I shall call ex ante and ex post. Ex ante rationing occurs when a borrower would like a larger credit limit, given his expectations of the interest rate he will be charged, prior to his actual use of the credit limit. That is, the borrower can anticipate the possibility of some situations in which he might face a binding credit constraint. Ex post rationing occurs when the borrower needs more credit than his limit given the interest rate. This paper is concerned with the existence of ex ante credit rationing in a credit market in which there are no interest rate ceilings on borrowers and lenders, and the credit market is assumed to be competitive in that lenders earn zero expected profit. The result is obtained in a simple two period model in which the borrower requires credit to finance a loan project that is subject to diminishing returns (such as a perfect competitor financing production subject to increasing marginal costs) and faces default risk. A further complication is introduced by assuming that the borrower has a random source of revenue during the life of the credit agreement and this random revenue affects his need for credit from the lender. This model is an abstraction from reality that tries to capture three features of real-life line of credit arrangements: (i) such facilities are typically available to borrowers who are financing working capital and whose revenue from the sale of output may be randomly spaced during the time the credit facility exists. (ii) since the borrower’s cash flow is irregular, then to the extent that overdraft credit and retained earnings are the only source of working capital to the borrower any fluctuations in cash flow will have an impact on the demand for borrowed credit. (iii) the credit facility is never established for an indefinite period, but rather is set up subject to review after a finite period. Once established, the limit is not altered until the review date. This abstracts, of course, from any central bank directive concerning limitations on lending rights. In addition to showing the existence of ex ante credit rationing, the paper also considers the impact of an alternative asset for the borrower to invest in in addition to working capital. As expected, the existence of the asset, by increasing the opportunities to the borrower, leads to a demand for a larger credit limit. The effect of a binding ceiling on lending rate is to raise the average rate of credit utilisation and to increase the degree of credit rationing. ...|$|E
