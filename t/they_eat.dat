5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct {{and they are very}} gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E
2500|$|They {{filled a}} second cup of wine for the leader. Then a child asked questions. If {{the child was}} not intelligent, the parent would {{instruct}} the child to ask why this night was different from all other nights. On all other nights <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> leavened and unleavened bread, while on this night <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> only unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah).

On all other nights, <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> meat roasted, stewed, or boiled, while on this night <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> only roasted meat. On all other nights, they dipped once, while on this night they dipped twice. And the parent instructed according to the child's intelligence. The parent began {{to answer the questions}} by recounting the people's humble beginnings, and concluded with the people's praise.

5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} birds, {{with many}} reaching fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend {{in the number of}} individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.|$|E
5|$|Hawksbills {{are highly}} {{resilient}} and resistant to their prey. Some of the sponges <b>they</b> <b>eat,</b> such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, are highly (often lethally) toxic to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with {{significant numbers of}} siliceous spicules, such as Ancorina, Geodia (G. gibberosa), Ecionemia, and Placospongia.|$|E
5|$|In western Madagascar, {{sympatric}} ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) {{have been}} studied together. Little interaction takes place between the two species. While the diets of the two species overlap, <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> in different proportions since the ring-tailed lemur has a more varied diet and spends {{more time on the}} ground.|$|E

5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> with the lunar cycle. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E

5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E

Number One suggests <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E

Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E
