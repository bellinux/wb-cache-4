25|$|Fluorescent lamps can run {{directly}} from a direct current (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the tube.

25|$|The Devils Garden is {{also known}} as a Wilderness Study Area for the purpose of {{possible}} wilderness designation; however, wilderness status was not recommended by the BLM's District Manager in an Instant Study Area report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 1991.

A second reason was the likelihood of several groups of people converging at the same time around the main formations of the site, which are located in a 10-acre area adjacent to the parking lot (1.6% of the total designated area of 640 acres).

Almost all of the 1,000 Issei in New York State by 1900 were in New York City. The Chinese Exclusion Acts of 1882 restricted Japanese immigration to the United States and the United States and Japanese governments had a gentlemen's agreement where the Japanese would deny visas to laborers wishing to immigrate to the United States in exchange for the U.S. not officially ending Japanese immigration.

The low German opinion of Soviet combat capabilities had been confirmed, and was bolstered by information provided by captured VVS personnel.

However, the VVS recovered once surprise had worn off, as indicated in the lessening losses on the ground, and rise of casualties in the air. The autumn weather also provided breathing space to partially rebuild. Moreover, a number of crews survived the initial strikes on the ground, to be redeployed afresh.

Scream 3 antagonist Roman seeks revenge for what he sees as his mother's rejection and abandonment by engineering Maureen's death and trying to kill Sidney, seeing her as having the family-life he was denied.

25|$|The H1 lamp was {{the first}} tungsten-halogen {{headlamp}} light source. It was introduced in 1962 by a consortium of European bulb and headlamp makers. This bulb has a single axial filament that consumes 55 watts at 12.0 volts, and produces 1550 lumens ±15% when operated at 13.2V. H2 (55W @ 12.0V, 1820lm @ 13.2V) followed in 1964, and the transverse-filament H3 (55W @ 12.0V, 1450lm ±15%) in 1966. H1 still sees wide use in low beams, high beams and auxiliary fog and driving lamps, as does H3. The H2 {{is no longer a}} current type, since it requires an intricate bulb holder interface to the lamp, has a short life and is difficult to handle. For <b>those</b> <b>reasons,</b> H2 was withdrawn from ECE Regulation 37 for use in new lamp designs (though H2 bulbs are still manufactured for replacement purposes in existing lamps), but H1 and H3 remain current and these two bulbs were legalised in the United States in 1993. More recent single-filament bulb designs include the H7 (55W @ 12.0V, 1500lm ±10% @ 13.2V), H8 (35W @ 12.0V, 800lm ±15% @ 13.2V), H9 (65W @ 12.0V, 2100lm ±10% @ 13.2V), and H11 (55W @ 12.0V, 1350lm ±10% @ 13.2V). 24-volt versions of many bulb types are available for use in trucks, buses, and other commercial and military vehicles.|$|E

500|$|The Union of Lublin {{accelerated}} {{the process of}} massive Polonization of Lithuanian and Rus' elites and general nobility in Lithuania and the eastern borderlands, the process that retarded national development of local populations there. In 1563, Sigismund Augustus belatedly allowed the Eastern Orthodox Lithuanian nobility access to highest offices in the Duchy, {{but by that time}} the act was of little practical consequence, as there were few Orthodox nobles of any standing left and the encroaching Catholic Counter-Reformation would soon nullify the gains. Many magnate families of the east were of Ruthenian origin; their inclusion in the enlarged Crown made the magnate class much stronger politically and economically. Regular szlachta, increasingly dominated by the great land owners, lacked the will to align themselves with Cossack settlers in Ukraine to counterbalance the magnate power, and in the area of Cossack acceptance, integration and rights resorted to delayed and ineffective half-measures. The peasantry was being subjected to heavier burdens and more oppression.
