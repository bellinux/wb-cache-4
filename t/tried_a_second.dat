5|$|The next day, August 16, {{the prisoners}} were moved with their guards. One of the mortarmen, Cpl. Roy L. Day Jr., spoke Japanese {{and was able to}} {{converse}} with some of the North Koreans. That afternoon he overheard a North Korean lieutenant say that they would kill the prisoners if other American forces advanced too close. Later that day other American forces began to assault Hill 303 to retake the position. B Company and several American tanks <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time to retake the hill, now estimated to contain a 700-man battalion. The 61st Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion fired on the hill during the day. That night, G Company succeeded in escaping from Hill 303. Guards took away five of the American prisoners; the others did not know what became of them.|$|E

In November 2000 both the Home Secretary Jack Straw and the Leader of the Opposition William Hague favoured this measure.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1970s, Parton {{wanted to}} expand her {{audience}} base. Although her first attempt, the television variety show Dolly! (1976–77), had high ratings, it lasted only one season, with Parton requesting {{to be released}} from her contract because of the stress it was causing on her vocal cords.

After being repulsed <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time by the defenders at Cellorigo, he marched to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> assault on the castle at Pancorbo and another at Castrojeriz. Both attempts met in complete failure and great losses for the Muslim side. Humiliated, Al-Mundhir sent an envoy to King Alfonso III before leaving the Kingdom of Leon, to sue for another peace.|$|R
25|$|During the pretrial {{discovery}} process, Chambers produced {{new evidence}} indicating {{that he and}} Hiss {{had been involved in}} espionage, which both men had previously denied under oath to HUAC. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time. In January 1950, he was found guilty on both counts of perjury and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death.|$|E
25|$|Nogai's {{daughter}} {{married a}} son of Kublai's niece, Kelmish, who was wife of a Qongirat general of the Golden Horde. Nogai was angry with Kelmish's family because her Buddhist son despised his Muslim daughter. For this reason, he demanded Toqta send Kelmish's husband to him. Nogai's independent actions related to Rus' princes and foreign merchants had already annoyed the Khan. The Khan thus refused and declared war on Nogai. Toqta was defeated in their first battle. When the legitimate Khan Toqta <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, Nogai was killed in battle in 1299 at the Kagamlik, near the Dnieper. Toqta had his son stationed in Saqchi and along the Danube {{as far as the}} Iron Gate. Nogai's son Chaka, who had briefly made himself Emperor of Bulgaria, was murdered by Theodore Svetoslav on the orders of Toqta.|$|E

5000|$|The last in {{this line}} of cases before Robinson was Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). In Francis, the Court {{considered}} whether Louisiana could <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time to electrocute a convicted murderer, after the first attempt failed because of a defect in the State's electric chair. The Court held, 5-4, that re-electrocuting the defendant Francis was not cruel and unusual.|$|R

2500|$|Irving Nitzberg, who was [...] "imported" [...] by the Brooklyn [...] "Combination" [...] from The Bronx, was put {{on trial}} for the January 9, 1939, murder of Albert Shuman in Brooklyn based on the {{testimony}} of three accomplices, Abe Reles, Albert Tannenbaum and Seymour Magoon. Reles testified that Shuman was killed since he cooperated with the authorities who were conducting an inquiry of Lepke's involvement in labor racketeering. Reles also testified that he helped plan the murder of Shuman with Lepke, who was a fugitive at the time, and Mendy Weiss and that Lepke received approval from Albert Anastasia to use a person who lived outside Brooklyn to help with completing the assignment. Seymour Magoon testified that he stole the car used in the murder on Reles's orders. Albert Tannenbaum testified {{that he was the}} driver that picked up Nitzberg and Shuman under the pretense of performing a robbery. Nitzberg, who was in the back seat, shot Shuman twice {{in the back of the}} head when Tannenbaum gave a predetermined signal. Tannenbaum and Nitzberg then exited the murder car to join Reles and another gangster in the getaway car and departed from the crime scene. Nitzberg was convicted of first-degree murder on May 23, 1941, and sentenced to death in the electric chair. However, on December 10, 1941, the conviction was overturned on a 4–3 vote by New York's Court of Appeals, which questioned the use of testimony of non-accomplice witnesses who were promised leniency to support the testimony of Reles, Tannenbaum and Magoon. Nitzberg was <b>tried</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time in 1942 with the now-deceased Reles's testimony read to the jury. Nitzberg was convicted for a second time on March 12, 1942. The conviction was overturned again by the Court of Appeals on a 4–3 vote, but, this time, the court also dismissed the indictment as faulty since the only testimony presented to the Grand Jury was from accomplices without corroboration.|$|E
