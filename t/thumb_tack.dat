50|$|A <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> has {{two basic}} {{components:}} the head, often made of plastic, metal or wood, and the body, usually {{made of steel}} or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical {{and a variety of}} novelty heads such as hearts or stars. <b>Thumb</b> <b>tack</b> heads also {{come in a variety of}} colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.|$|E
50|$|A <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> (North American English) or {{push pin}} {{is a short}} nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and {{intended}} to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are {{used to refer to}} different designs intended for various purposes. <b>Thumb</b> <b>tack</b> and push pin are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation. Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map pin or map tack refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.|$|E

50|$|Some {{treatments}} of probability {{assume that the}} various outcomes of an experiment are always defined {{so as to be}} equally likely. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a sample space of equally likely outcomesâ€”for example, if one were to toss a <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> many times and observe whether it landed with its point upward or downward, there is no symmetry to suggest that the two outcomes should be equally likely.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{a teacher}} {{instructed}} her senior civics and economics class to take photographs {{to illustrate the}} rights contained in the United States Bill of Rights. One student [...] "had taken a photo of George Bush out of a magazine and tacked the picture to a wall with a red <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> through his head. Then he made a thumb's-down sign with his own hand next to the President's picture, {{and he had a}} photo taken of that, and he pasted it on a poster." [...] A Wal-Mart photo department employee reported it to police, and the Secret Service investigated. No charges were filed.|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was taken up}} to prepare and evaluate a transdermal drug delivery system (patch) of Raloxifene Hydrochloride to increase its bioavailability. The matrix type patches were prepared using different ratios of Eudragit RL 100, Poly vinyl Pyrrolidone K- 30, HPMC, CAP and PEG 6000 in different ratios. All the prepared formulations were subjected to physical studies (weight variation, thickness, moisture content, moisture uptake, flatness, Water Vapour transmission rate, folding endurance, tensile strength, and % elongation), <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> test, in vitro release studies, and in vitro diffusion studies. In vitro permeation studies were performed using artificial membrane and across skin derived from albino rat. The accelerated stability studies for the formulations were performed as per the ICH guidelines. The studies showed that formulation prepare...|$|E

40|$|Tammar wallaby {{spermatozoa}} undergo maturation during transit {{through the}} epididymis. This maturation {{differs from that}} seen in eutherian mammals because in addition to biochemical and functional maturation there are also major changes in morphology, in particular formation of the condensed acrosome and reorientation of the sperm head and tail. Of spermatozoa released from the testes, 83 % had a large immature acrosome. By the time spermatozoa reached the proximal cauda epididymis 100 % of sperm had condensed acrosomes. Similarly 86 % of testicular spermatozoa had immature <b>thumb</b> <b>tack</b> or T shape head-tail orientation while only 2 % retained this immature morphology in the corpus epididymis. This maturation {{is very similar to}} that reported for the common brush tail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. However, morphological maturation occurred earlier in epididymal transit in the tammar wallaby. By the time spermatozoa had reached the proximal cauda epididymis no spermatozoa had an immature acrosome and thumbtack orientation. Associated with acrosomal maturation was an increase in acrosomal thiols and the formation of disulphides which presumably account for the unusual stability of the wallaby sperm acrosome. The development of motility and progressive motility of tammar wallaby spermatozoa {{is similar to that of}} other marsupials and eutherian mammals. Spermatozoa are immotile in the testes and the percentage of motile spermatozoa and the strength of their motility increases during epididymal transit. During passage through the caput and corpus epididymis, spermatozoa first became weakly motile in the proximal caput and then increasingly progressively motile through the corpus epididymis. Tammar wallaby spermatozoa collected from the proximal cauda epididymis had motility not different from ejaculated spermatozoa. Ultrastructural studies indicated that acrosomal condensation involved a complex infolding of the immature acrosome. At spermiation the acrosome of tammar wallaby spermatozoa was a relatively large flat or concave disc which projected laterally and anteriorly beyond the limits of the nucleus. During transit of the epididymal caput and proximal corpus the lateral projections folded inwards to form a cup like structure the sides of which eventually met and fused. The cavity produced by this fusion was lost as the acrosome condensed to its mature form as a small button-like structure contained within the depression on the anterior end of the nucleus. During this process the dorsal surface of the immature acrosome and its outer acrosomal membrane and overlying plasma membrane were engulfed into the acrosomal matrix. This means that the dorsal surface of the acrosomal region of the testicular tammar wallaby sperm head is a transient structure. The dorsal acrosomal surface of the mature spermatozoon appears ultrastructurally to be the relocated ventral surface of the acrosomal projections which previously extended out beyond the acrosomal depression on the dorsal surface of the nucleus of the immature spermatozoon...|$|E

50|$|Half Pint Brawlers is {{a wrestling}} company and {{television}} series. The company {{is considered the}} craziest and also the top midget wrestling company in the country. Known for controversy and also for their hardcore wrestling style, they often use staple guns, <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks,</b> broken bottles, and barbed wire in their matches. Half Pint Brawlers had a fraternity kicked off of campus for one of their politically incorrect shows, and have been banned from performing in certain states.|$|R
50|$|The match saw real blood, fake {{glass and}} one {{contestant}} {{setting fire to}} a chair. The ring ropes were replaced with barbed wire and a bucket of <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks</b> was dumped on the ring floor. Much of the controversy surrounded rumours about the event, suggesting that the outpour of blood was so intense that it 'splattered' onto members of the crowd. Much {{of this can be}} attributed to people who had heard about the match giving their take of it on the Internet.|$|R
50|$|While {{flip-flops}} {{do provide}} the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as hot sand at the beach, glass, <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks</b> or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pools, their simple design {{is responsible for}} a host of other injuries of the foot and lower leg. In the United Kingdom in 2002, 55,100 individuals went to hospital with flip-flop related injuries. By 2010, there were 200,000 flip-flop related injuries costing the National Health Service in Britain Â£40 million.|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} conditions and the pessimistic visions of the Norwegian Department of Interior ("The difficulty in competing with foreign factories means that industry will never succeed in this country"), by 1860 Ole Mustad led his company to a primary position {{in the production of}} small metal products like fencing wire, nails, pins, fish hooks, horseshoe nails, shipbuilding nails, paper clips, <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks</b> and a series of other metallic wire-based products. By refining and industrializing the manual production of fish hooks in 1877, the company managed to become a global market leader in just a few years.|$|R
50|$|Monster's Ball VII {{took place}} at Bound for Glory IV and is the first ever Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The teams in the match were Abyss, who would be {{appearing}} in his seventh Monster's Ball match, and Matt Morgan, Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez), and Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), who were the champions. Halfway through, Abyss was taken out by being double-chokeslammed through a flaming table. The match ended when 3D put Hernandez through a table with <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks</b> on it, with Beer Money, Inc spitting beer in Devon's face and stealing the pin to retain the titles.|$|R
50|$|In a {{pleasant}} surprise, Sonjay Dutt plugged CZW after the match and suggested he might return {{as he could}} in 2009 (with everyone waiting for the expected heel swerve that for once wasn't forced on by a promoter). 2 Girls, 1 Cup defeated The Olsens, Miracle Ultraviolence Connection, and Team Andrew to retain the CZW Tag Team Titles. Given Nick Gage's concussion at the time, expectations for this match weren't what {{they might have been}} under other circumstances. Gage won the match for H8 Club, as he hammered Ruckus at the end with at least 7 Chokebreakers {{at the end of the}} match. Ruckus was ruled unable to continue by the referee.

2500|$|In April, Ambrose began a {{rivalry with}} Chris Jericho after Shane McMahon {{cancelled}} The Highlight Reel {{and replaced it}} with The Ambrose Asylum. This resulted in a match at Payback on May 1, where Ambrose defeated Jericho. The following night on Raw, Ambrose invited Stephanie McMahon on The Ambrose Asylum, confronting her about being insincere with her recent nice demeanor and rather than give him an answer she cancelled Ambrose's show and reinstated Jericho's Highlight Reel, prompting the two to attacking each other and ending with Jericho smashing Ambrose's potted plant [...] "Mitch" [...] over his head to extend their feud. After destroying Jericho's light-up jacket and being put by Jericho in a straitjacket, Ambrose challenged him to an Asylum match (a steel cage match with weapons hanging above the cage and a stipulation where escape from the cage was not allowed or would not allow for victory) at Extreme Rules on May 22, where Ambrose won by pinfall when performing a Dirty Deeds on Jericho after slamming him onto a bed of <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Monster's Ball {{match is}} a {{professional}} wrestling, hardcore match staged by Global Force Wrestling. The key premise of the match was that all contenders are sequestered alone in a locked room without light, food or water for twenty-four hours before the match. This stipulation is intended to induce extreme feelings of aggression in the competitors. Once released, the wrestlers fight {{one another in a}} no disqualification match, with the usage of weapons encouraged. Victory can be achieved by pinfall or submission, with the match ending as soon as one wrestler is pinned or submits (there is no elimination format). The locked away stipulation was simply forgotten about, however, and not mentioned since the sixth one. It is now simply a Street Fight, as the match has to end inside the Ring. Many signature weapons include: <b>Thumb</b> <b>tacks,</b> [...] "Janice" [...] (Abyss' friend: A board filled with nails) and a bed of barbed wires. Due to the hardcore nature of the match, the Monster's Ball typically features numerous high spots. There has been a total of fourteen official matches, plus eleven occurring on Impact non-televised [...] "house shows" [...] and one match dubbed [...] "Monster's Ball" [...] by a non-affiliated company, although it featured Impact wrestler Abyss. There is apparently no set number of wrestlers although it is generally four. The smallest official match was a one-on-one match at Bound for Glory (2009) and Slammiversary VIII.|$|R
40|$|Two Guys from Lincoln: Cameron Shaw and Craig Roper {{offers the}} work of two {{contemporary}} artists who are inheritors of the anti-art tradition that continued {{in the wake of}} Duchamp with Warhol 2 Ì† 7 s use of popular imagery and, more recently, Koons 2 Ì† 7 controversial kitsch sculpture. Though distinct in their visions of art and the world, Shaw and Roper share more than their home town. As social and aesthetic contemporaries these two artists arrive at conclusions that suggest a generational commonality. Both artists use assemblage to address issues such as the disillusionment of youth, emblems of male dominance, the ambiguity of history, and the death of the American dream. And both artists have developed iconographies that convey multiple meanings about our collective memory. Shaw 2 Ì† 7 s highly crafted constructions and his interest in history complement Roper 2 Ì† 7 s irreverent objects and his investigations of popular culture. Together they form a compelling commentary on contemporary values. A combination of found and made elements, Craig Roper 2 Ì† 7 s objects are at once casual and confrontational. But their informal appearance belies serious content. Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon # 2 incorporates a photographic diptych representing ajackalope labeled 2 Ì† 2 cheap art 2 Ì† 2 and the image of a framed wildlife painting of a duck inscribed as 2 Ì† 2 cheap bourbon. 2 Ì† 2 The two photos are mounted with <b>thumb</b> <b>tacks</b> onto a crude sheet of Styrofoam. Beneath this quirky union is a wooden shelf displaying two corresponding bottles of 2 Ì† 2 Bourbon de Luxe 2 Ì† 2 and a pair of shot glasses. The mixed metaphors of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon make explicit connections between the fantastic deception of the mythical creature, the jackal ope, and the implied manipulation of the art market and the promotion of rote representation {{in the form of the}} duck picture as 2 Ì† 2 art. 2 Ì† 2 By juxtaposing these two images with the bottles of whiskey, Roper suggests that all these things are aesthetically related, that cheap bourbon and cheap art are equally accessible at the lower echelons of consumerism. This 2 Ì† 2 you get what you pay for 2 Ì† 2 message was delivered with a twist when Roper offered an earlier version of the piece for sale at a price of merely 100. By making the work so readily available, the artist relegated his own work to the level of the kitsch objects he parodies. Also, the raw construction of Cheap Art, Cheap Bourbon challenges the elevated standards of traditional fine art. The viewer concludes that cheap art (a. k. a. bad art) is incestuously related to inferior values, and ultimately contributes to the deterioration of our culture...|$|R
