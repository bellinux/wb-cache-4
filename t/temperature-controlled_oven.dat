50|$|Developed by James Hartledsay in 1848. The {{glass is}} taken from the furnace in large iron ladles, which are carried upon slings running on {{overhead}} rails; from the ladle the glass is thrown upon the cast-iron bed of a rolling-table; and is rolled into sheet by an iron roller, the process being similar to that employed in making plate-glass, but on a smaller scale. The sheet thus rolled is roughly trimmed while hot and soft, so as to remove those portions of glass which have been spoiled by immediate contact with the ladle, and the sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> called a lehr, down which it is carried by a system of rollers.|$|E

The casting is carried out from dimethylformamide solutions inside <b>temperature-controlled</b> air-circulated <b>ovens</b> {{in order to minimize}} the establishment of thermal gradients throughout the casting solution. The technique produces quality sheets in 9 days, compared with 40 - 45 days for an inferior film produced in open pans...|$|R
50|$|A {{vacuum bag}} is a {{bag made of}} strong rubber-coated fabric or a polymer film used to {{compress}} the part during cure or hardening. In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a mold is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to {{the outer edge of}} the mold face.When using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a vacuum pump. As a result, uniform pressure approaching one atmosphere is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the adhesive cures. The entire bag may be placed in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven,</b> oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of glass}} as a {{building}} material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton {{to house the}} Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker. This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers. James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.|$|E
30|$|Two {{types of}} data are {{required}} for simulation process: water quality data and river’s hydraulic characteristics. Grab water samples were collected in nine points (30  cm depth) at two different months June 2016 and February 2017 (Fig.  1). The samples for TDS analysis were collected in polypropylene bottles and analyzed using <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> method. Water samples for BOD estimation were collected in non-reactive borosilicate glass BOD bottles (300  mL capacity) and measured using standard Winkler method. Water temperature was measured in situ using the mercury thermometer. It should be noticed that the greater the number of samples taken from the river, the more accurate the calibration and validation process. The samples considered in this study may not be quite sufficient for simulation process; however, they can be reasonable for calibrating and validating the model.|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} hydrothermal synthesis {{process of}} MCM- 41 requires a long crystallization {{time and a}} high crystallization temperature. In 1996, thermally stable molecular sieve MCM- 41 with hexagonal channels was synthesized in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> microwave <b>oven</b> from aged precursor gels within about 1  h by Wu et al. [32]. At present, microwave irradiation technique is widely applied to the synthesis of mesoporous molecular sieves [33 – 35]. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal synthesis method, microwave-assisted synthesis method employs microwave dielectric heating, uniform heating, or molecular selective heating. Thus, it offers the advantages of homogeneous heating and fast elevation of the temperature of synthesis system to crystallization temperature, resulting in more homogeneous nucleation, shorter crystallization times [36, 37], and products with uniform size [38, 39].|$|R
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a <b>temperature-controlled</b> kiln or <b>oven),</b> glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|R
40|$|A semiautomatic {{self-leveling}} lunar gravimeter {{has been}} designed for the Apollo 17 mission. This traverse gravimeter, which is completely self-contained and powered by an internal battery, {{was used to measure}} gravity at predetermined stops along the route of the Lunar Rover Vehicle. The gravity sensor is a vibrating string accelerometer (VSA) enclosed in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> and gimballed leveling assembly. This instrument is capable of resolving gravity differences as small as 0. 035 milligal (1 mgal = 0. 001 cm/s) on the moon and yet also is able to measure the earth's gravity field of 980, 000 milligals. Twenty-two measurements were taken on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission, during which the VSA temperature never varied more than 0. 005 C. The flight results indicate an instrument accuracy of better than 2 mgal...|$|E
30|$|We conduct shear {{deformation}} experiments {{by using a}} rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 102). The samples are sandwiched between two parallel plates made of Inconel and placed inside a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven,</b> the same method used in Gonnermann et al. (2017) and Namiki and Tanaka (2017). The maximum temperature achieved by this oven is 1000 °C. We heat the oven to the desired temperature T; wait > 15 min at T, which is sufficiently longer than the thermal diffusion time; and then deform the sample under a certain normal stress. Here, we conducted our experiments at a temperature lower than the upper limit of our apparatus, <  1000 °C. This temperature range {{is lower than the}} previously estimated eruptive temperature, 950 <T< 1150 ^∘, and may be consistent with the temperature at the uppermost part of the magma column in the conduit during the quiescent time.|$|E
40|$|A {{hollow cathode}} {{discharge}} reactor with White-cell multipass configuration (laser path-length = 22. 4 m) was used. Its description is found elsewhere [5]. Pure Ar flow at 0. 4 mbar {{in its natural}} isotopic composition is used to generate 40 ArH+, 38 ArH+, 36 ArH+. Attempts to increase the ArH+ IR absorptions by adding H 2 failed, indicating that tiny amounts of H 2 are necessary to optimize ArH+ concentrations. Recent experiments on the kinetics at different Ar/H 2 mole fractions and pressures suggest that electron temperature and H 3 + excitation (through {{the balance of the}} reaction H 3 + + Ar ArH+ + H 2 [6]) have a drastic effect on ArH+ concentration.

40|$|Polyamide 12 (PA 12) -based powders are {{the most}} used {{materials}} in the laser sintering (LS) process for rapid manufacturing of functional parts. An average of 80 – 90 per cent of the powdered material in the LS building chamber is not sintered and could be reused. However, {{the properties of the}} recycled powder vary, which ultimately affects the quality of produced parts. These differences are due to the process conditions such as temperature and time, the LS machine design, and properties of the powder used for parts fabrication. This paper analyses the LS processing conditions and current recycling practices in relation with the deterioration or ageing of the PA 12 -based powders. Samples of new and recycled grades of PA 2200 powder were artificially aged in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> and then tested using differential scanning calorimetry, melt flowrate indexer, and gel permeation chromatography.

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} single photon {{ionization}} of gas phase adenine and cytosine {{by means of}} vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation coupled to a velocity map imaging electron∕ion coincidence spectrometer. Both in-vacuum <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> and aerosol thermodesorption were successfully applied to promote the intact neutral biological species into the gas phase. The photoion yields are consistent with previous measurements. In addition, we deduced the threshold photoelectron spectra and the slow photoelectron spectra for both species, where the close to zero kinetic energy photoelectrons and the corresponding photoions are measured in coincidence. The photoionization close and above the ionization energies are found to occur mainly via direct processes. Both vaporization techniques lead to similar electronic spectra for the two molecules, which consist of broadbands due to the complex electronic structure of the cationic species and to the possible contribution of several neutral tautomers for cytosine prior to ionization. Accurate ionization energies are measured for adenine and cytosine at, respectively, 8. 267 ± 0. 005 eV and 8. 66 ± 0. 01 eV, and we deduce precise thermochemical data for the adenine radical cation. Finally, we performed an evaluation and {{a comparison of the}} two vaporization techniques addressing the following criteria: measurement precision, thermal fragmentation, sensitivity, and sample consumption. The aerosol thermodesorption technique appears as a promising alternative to vaporize large thermolabile biological compounds, where extended thermal decomposition or low sensitivity could be encountered when using a simple oven vaporization technique...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are being used}} in the aerospace industry as a means of reducing vehicle weight. In particular, polymer matrix composites (PMC) are good candidates due to their high strength-to-weight and high stiffness-to-weight ratios. Future reusable space launch vehicles and space exploration structures will need advanced light weight composites in order to minimize vehicle weight while demonstrating robustness and durability, guaranteeing high factors of safety. In particular, the implementation of composite cryogenic propellant fuel tanks (cryotanks) for future reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) could greatly reduce the vehicle's weight versus identically sized cryotanks constructed of metallic materials. One candidate composite material for future cryotank designs is IM 7 / 977 - 2, which is a graphite/epoxy system. A successful candidate must demonstrate reasonable structural properties over a wide range of temperatures. Since the matrix material is normally the weak link in the composite, tests that emphasize matrix-dominated behavior need to be conducted. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of "unidirectional" 8 -ply and 16 -ply IM 7 / 977 - 2 through experimental testing. Tests were performed at - 196 degrees Celsius (- 320 degrees Fahrenheit), 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit), 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) and 160 degrees C (320 degrees Fahrenheit). Low temperature testing was completed while the specimen was submerged in a liquid nitrogen bath. High temperature testing was completed in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven...</b>|$|E

Compressed air (19.5  mL/min) was sparged through a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven</b> (50  °C) holding a calibrated ethanol permeation tube (emission rate 209  ng/min at 50  °C). Mass flow controllers were used to control medical grade compressed air flowing through the permeation tube and a second dilution stream, introduced after the permeation tube, to produce concentrations of 101, 199, 484 and 924  ppb of ethanol based on the calibrated permeation tube emission rate. The concentration of ethanol produced with the permeation tube was checked using the platinum catalyst system as described previously (Baasandorj et al. 2015) resulting in a line with a slope of 1.1 and an R 2 value of 0.997 (data not shown). The temperature of the permeation tube was then increased to 80  °C to produce ethanol concentrations comparable to those observed in the fungal experiment (1.2 – 6.2  ppm). The humidity of the air was varied by utilizing a hydration flask before the dilution. Humidity was monitored via the ratio of the H 3 O+(H 2 O) to H 3 O+ ion intensities with calibration experiments performed under conditions that closely matched the humidity in the fungal experiments. At low humidity, the sensitivity factor had a relatively constant value of approximately 4.0. Calibrations were repeated after the experiments and yielded a sensitivity factor of approximately 3.9.|$|E

Combining a weathering model and field observations, we were able to define a two-step weathering process that includes a control on the Pb-isotope ratios by accessory phases and by the main minerals from the granite in a second step of weathering. In order to go further and to better characterize water/rock interactions, we performed laboratory experiments with the two main granite bedrocks from this site. The aim of the present work is to better constrain the processes of water/rock interactions both in terms of source (dissolution of different primary minerals) and extent of weathering, by measuring Pb isotope signatures in addition with Li isotope signatures. Laboratory experiments consisted in measuring the evolution through time of major and trace elements, as well as Pb and Li isotopic compositions of a rainwater solution in equilibrium with a granite powder. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C with a solution/powder mass ratio of 10 considering 15 mL of reference solution TMRAIN- 95 and 1. 5 g of powdered granite placed in screw-top Teflon® PFA beakers. The beakers were kept in a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven,</b> which temperature was maintained within 5 % of target temperature over the total duration of the experiments. Aliquots of the solution (after filtration at 0. 2 µm) in contact with the granite powder were periodically sampled (from weeks up to 2 years) and analyzed for lead and lithium isotopic compositions. The results show that a radiogenic contribution of lead is observed during the experiments, in agreement with the field observations, and that the light lithium isotope (6 Li) is preferentially retained during uptake of Li into secondary minerals. The results of these experiments will be discussed in the frame of the relative proportion of granite weathering (dissolution of primary minerals) to secondary mineral formation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we report the set-up of a novel twin chamber {{technique}} that uses the comparative method and establishes an appropriate connection of atmospheric and laboratory methods to broaden the tools for investigations. It is designed to study the impact of certain parameters and gases on ambient processes, such as particle formation online, and can be applied in a large variety of conditions. The characterisation of both chambers proved that both chambers operate identically, with a residence time xT (COMPASS 1) = 26. 5 ± 0. 3 min and xT (COMPASS 2) = 26. 6 ± 0. 4 min, at a typical flow rate of 15 L min− 1 and a gas leak rate of (1. 6 ± 0. 8) × 10 − 5 s− 1. Particle loss rates {{were found to be}} larger (due to the particles' stickiness to the chamber walls), with an extrapolated maximum of 1. 8 × 10 − 3 s− 1 at 1 nm, i. e. a hundredfold of the gas leak rate. This latter value is associated with sticky non-volatile gaseous compounds, too. Comparison measurement showed no significant differences. Therefore operation under atmospheric conditions is trustworthy. To indicate the applicability and the benefit of the system, a set of experiments was conducted under different conditions, i. e. urban and remote, enhanced ozone and terpenes as well as reduced sunlight. In order to do so, an ozone lamp was applied to enhance ozone in one of two chambers; the measurement chamber was protected from radiation by a first-aid cover and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were added using a small additional flow and a <b>temperature-controlled</b> <b>oven.</b> During the elevated ozone period, ambient particle number and volume increased substantially at urban and remote conditions, but by a different intensity. Protection of solar radiation displayed a clear negative effect on particle number, while terpene addition did cause a distinct daily pattern. E. g. adding β pinene particle number concentration rose by 13 % maximum at noontime, while no significant effect was observable during darkness. Therefore, the system is a useful tool for investigating local precursors and the details of ambient particle formation at surface locations as well as potential future feedback processes...|$|E
