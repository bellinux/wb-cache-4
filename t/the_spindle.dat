Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved {{from one to the other}} depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant.

5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> it would knot itself into a whorl on <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> {{might have to be}} stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> and flyer rotate, on the cap frame <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving up and down <b>the</b> <b>spindle</b> is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on {{at the line of}} the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E

40|$|Spindle-shaped, organic microstructures ("spindles") are {{now known}} from Archean cherts in three localities (Figs. 1 - 4) : The ~ 3 Ga Farrel Quartzite from the Pilbara of Australia [1]; the older, ~ 3. 3 - 3. 4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation, {{also from the}} Pilbara of Australia [2]; and the ~ 3. 4 Ga Kromberg Formation of the Barberton Mountain Land of South Africa [3]. Though <b>the</b> <b>spindles</b> were {{previously}} speculated to be pseudofossils or epigenetic organic contaminants, {{a growing body of}} data suggests that these structures are bona fide microfossils and further, that they are syngenetic with the Archean cherts in which they occur [1 - 2, 4 - 10]. As such, <b>the</b> <b>spindles</b> are among some of the oldest-known organically preserved microfossils on Earth. Moreover, recent delta C- 13 study of individual <b>spindles</b> from <b>the</b> Farrel Quartzite (using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry [SIMS]) suggests that <b>the</b> <b>spindles</b> may have been planktonic (living in open water), as opposed to benthic (living as bottom dwellers in contact with muds or sediments) [9]. Since most Precambrian microbiotas have been described from benthic, matforming communities, a planktonic lifestyle for <b>the</b> <b>spindles</b> suggests that these structures could represent a segment of the Archean biosphere that is poorly known. Here we synthesize the recent work on <b>the</b> <b>spindles,</b> and we add new observations regarding their geographic distribution, robustness, planktonic habit, and long-lived success.

40|$|The {{machine of}} this {{invention}} {{provides for the}} forming of large round bales, weighing from a half a ton to a ton, from a windrowed ?brous material such as hay or the like, transporting the bales to a storage position, and releasing the bales at the storage position. A pair of transversely spaced swing arms are supported on a portable frame unit for up and down pivotal movement between bale releasing positions projected rearwardly of the frame unit to for wardly projected bale forming positions, and for pivotal movement toward and {{away from each other}} in either the bale forming or bale releasing positions therefor. A rotata ble material wrapping and bale supporting spindle is car ried at the free end of each arm so that when the arms are in their bale forming positions, <b>the</b> <b>spindles</b> project in wardly toward each other from the opposite ends of a bale forming compartment that extends transversely of the frame unit.
