However, en route to safety, René is {{stricken}} with pseudo-menstrual cramps, and they are again captured by the frog. Squeezit's head, which has now sprouted chicken wings, finds the king and informs him of what has happened.|$|E
5|$|As {{they reach}} a river, Snow once again tricks Charming and escapes again, {{only to be}} {{captured}} moments later by the Queen's henchmen. Their orders are to cut out Snow's heart {{and bring it to}} the Queen. Charming attacks the henchmen with his sword, killing two. One henchman gets away with Snow, and Charming quickly dispatches him with an arrow. Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to the place where she sold the items.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.|$|E

5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then {{he should be able}} to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda {{appears in the doorway}} and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E

In Rome, Francisco de Paula's parents tried <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to {{a career in the}} Church. He received minor orders, wore religious garments daily and the Pope offered to make him cardinal. However Francisco de Paula had no real inclination for clerical life.|$|E
25|$|Deciding {{to become}} a wrestler, Austin joined Chris Adams' school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Adams also {{wrestled}} for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Adams' training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe (still somewhat a guarded secret at the time) or business. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who called the spots <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to a pinfall and a $40 payday.|$|E
25|$|As the {{breakaway}} {{neared the}} finish, the riders traded attacks, {{but there was}} no real beginning to the closing sprint. A quick closing kick from Casar gave him the stage win, with a 1 second gap over his mates. Boonen's Quick Step team came forward in the final two kilometers <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> out, with Robert Hunter and Erik Zabel right in the mix. Boonen again made it to the line ahead of his rivals, essentially clinching the green jersey win. The peloton split on the way up the slight uphill finish, giving Cadel Evans and Yaroslav Popovych, among others, three seconds back on Contador.|$|E

He finds the woman, treed by a buffalo, and rescues her, only to realize he has now lost his way and cannot relocate the camp. The woman, Ingwamza, undertakes <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> back to her village. When daylight comes and Cuff can finally see her clearly, he discovers Ingwamza too is a mutation; despite her generally human proportions, she has greenish-yellow hair, a short tail, and the head of a baboon. Startled, he accidentally shoots himself in the foot.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish for a better life is a likely {{explanation}} but does not suggest why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly because it was in secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the sub-prefect of Aoste to refuse or at least make permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E
25|$|In Japan {{much of the}} Chinese type is apparent. The native carver is fond of massing foliage {{without the}} stalk <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him.</b> He appears to put in his foliage, fruit and flowers first and then to {{indicate}} a stalk here and there, thus reversing {{the order of the}} Western method. Such a treatment, especially when birds and beasts are introduced, has the highest decorative effect. But, as such close treatment is bound to do, it depends for success to some extent upon its scheme of color. A long panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicting merchants with their packhorse, strongly resembles in its grouping and treatment Gothic work of the 15th century, as for example the panel of St Hubert in the museum at Chftlons. The strength and character of Japanese figure work is quite equal to the best Gothic sculpture of the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.|$|E
25|$|When Lü Meng pacified Changsha Commandery, {{he passed}} by Ling County (酃縣; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (鄧玄之), {{an old friend}} of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, Lü Meng summoned all his {{officers}} and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling Commandery the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling Commandery and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong Commandery by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling Commandery. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed Lü Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to Lü Meng. When Lü Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling Commandery but it was too late. Lü Meng left Sun He (孫河) behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E

500|$|Rafe Adler is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} in [...] He is voiced and motion-captured by Warren Kole. He is a wealthy treasure hunter and an old acquaintance of Nathan and Sam Drake, working with them in a Panamanian prison to find clues regarding the whereabouts of legendary pirate Henry Avery's lost fortune. When Vargas, the corrupt prison warden, demands {{a share of the}} treasure, Adler kills him and the three attempt to escape the prison. Sam is apparently killed in the ensuing shootout and Nathan loses interest in finding the treasure, forcing Adler to continue alone. A few years later, Adler enlists the help of Nadine Ross and her private military order, Shoreline, to find the treasure in Libertalia, which is in King's Bay in Madagascar. Adler also discovers Sam survived and arranges for his release from prison to enlist his aid, but Sam defects and approaches Nathan, leaving Adler to search himself. He comes into contact with the protagonists at an auction in Italy, subtly warning Victor Sullivan to stay out of his way, though he fails to obtain the St. Dismas Cross when it is stolen by Sam and Nathan. Adler, however, hacks into their phones and uses their GPS to track them to King's Bay. Later, on the island in which Libertalia is located, he reveals he had Sam released. After a brief scuffle, Adler forces Sam <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>him</b> to the treasure, though he manages to escape. Adler and Ross eventually reach Avery's ship, though by now, Ross has lost patience with Adler and demands that they leave with a portion of the loot, fearing that Avery's ship is rigged with traps. Adler refuses and turns Ross's men against her to coerce her into helping him. Inside the ship, however, a trap is sprung and Adler confronts Nathan and an injured Sam inside the brig. Ross betrays Adler and abandons him to die with Nathan. In his rage, Adler grabs a sword and duels Nathan, and though he overpowers him, Nathan unloads a net of heavy treasure that crushes Adler, killing him.|$|E
