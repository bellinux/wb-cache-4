5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5|$|Pausch was {{diagnosed}} with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) on September 19, 2006, in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the disease. He was told in August 2007 <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> remaining {{three to six months}} of good health. He soon moved his family to Chesapeake, Virginia, a suburb of Norfolk, to be close to his wife's family. On March 13, 2008, Pausch advocated for greater federal funding for pancreatic cancer before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. In the week prior to this, he had been hospitalized in order to have needle aspiration of pleural effusion in his right lung.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been every reason <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But {{there is certainly}} no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

25|$|Paul's {{teaching}} {{about the end of}} the world is expressed most clearly in his letters to the Christians at Thessalonica.

The form of the end will be a battle between Jesus and the man of lawlessness whose conclusion is the triumph of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Hitler {{had been}} deceived {{as to the}} real {{location}} of the Allied landing, believing that Sardinia and the Peloponnese {{were more likely to}} be the target. Following the landing at Sicily, the staff of Army Group E continued <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> second landing in Greece for a short time, anticipating that the Greek resistance would act as a fifth column. Despite the success of the operation, Maitland Wilson admitted that the civilian population of Greece had suffered much in the German reprisals. This was partially due to inefficient planning by ELAS, which failed to provide the civilian population with adequate warning of German reprisals. Following the end of the operation Greece lost what little strategic importance it had in the Allied war effort.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-elastic light {{scattering}} offers direct experimental access to {{measurement of the}} wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the viscoelastic properties of the gel. It is reasonable <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> relationship between the amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures {{the resistance of the}} network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>a</b> student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
