5|$|On 25 November 2000, Braathens {{terminated}} {{the route}} to Murmansk. On 2 January 2001, they also terminated <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> from Molde to Kristiansand and from Kristiansand to Trondheim, <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> to Røros from Trondheim and Oslo, and the services from Oslo to Newcastle. <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> from Bergen to Haugesund were reduced from five to three round trips, and the Bergen–Molde–Trondheim route was reduced from four to three. The capacity on <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> from Oslo to Molde and Kristiansund were increased. A second round trip was introduced from Stavanger to Newcastle, flown by Norwegian Air Shuttle. From 15 February, the airline introduced four weekly services from Oslo to Barcelona, and from 1 March, three weekly round trips to directly from Longyearbyen to Oslo. A direct service was introduced from Bergen to Alicante from 7 April.|$|E
5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario {{grew in the}} early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the launch}} of fast ferry service in 2017, Kitsap Transit {{introduced}} new express bus service to the Bremerton terminal that is timed to ferry departures and arrivals. <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> connect Bremerton to Silverdale, Poulsbo, and East Bremerton.|$|E
50|$|To return <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> Reply, <b>the</b> {{destination}} node {{must have a}} <b>route</b> to <b>the</b> source node. If <b>the</b> <b>route</b> is in <b>the</b> Destination Node's <b>route</b> cache, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> would be used. Otherwise, the node will reverse <b>the</b> <b>route</b> based on <b>the</b> <b>route</b> record in <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> Request message header (this requires that all links are symmetric).In the event of fatal transmission, <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> Maintenance Phase is initiated whereby <b>the</b> <b>Route</b> Error packets are generated at a node.

50|$|A letter A or B may {{be added}} after <b>the</b> <b>route</b> number, which {{indicates}} small variations of <b>the</b> <b>route,</b> {{and if a}} letter K appears before <b>the</b> <b>route</b> number, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> is a fast route which runs parallel to <b>the</b> corresponding <b>route</b> without K (for example, K113 is <b>the</b> fast <b>route</b> of 113).|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{northwest}} through Wales, NY78 {{remains a}} two-lane rural street known as Strykersville Road until intersecting with US20A (Big Tree Road) at a T-intersection. US 20A and NY 78 become concurrent along Big Tree, proceeding west {{through the town}} of Wales. <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> remain a two-lane residential street for a distance, intersecting with CR383 (Reiter Road) as it winds west. Now {{in the town of}} Aurora, US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY400 (the Aurora Expressway). A short distance later, <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> enter the village of East Aurora. Now known as Main Street, US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two-lane village street, intersecting with NY16 (Olean Road) and the southern continuation of CR6 (Pine Street).|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{over the}} west branch of Cazenovia Creek, NY240 and CR30 {{continue}} north through Concord, bending northwest into an intersection with CR563 (Foote Road). <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> bend northward through the hamlet of Footes, paralleling the creek and railroad track before entering the town of Colden. In Colden, NY240 and CR30 become a two-lane residential street surrounded by dense woods in the nearby hills. After another bend to the northwest, <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> enter the hamlet of Glenwood. In Glenwood, NY240 intersects with the western terminus of CR240 (HollandGlenwood Road), which doubles as the northern terminus of CR30, as NY240 is state-maintained north of this junction.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 the Indiana American Revolution Bicentennial Commission and the Indiana Highway Commission erected an {{estimated}} 600 signs {{to establish the}} George Rogers Clark Trail, marking <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> used by Clark and his men in Indiana during the Revolutionary War.|$|E
50|$|AR 123 {{begins in}} Clarksville and runs east, {{crossing}} AR 103. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> concurs with US 64 for a stretch until Lamar. North of Lamar <b>the</b> <b>route</b> meets AR 164 and AR 292 before winding to enter Ozark National Forest.

50|$|In Fishers, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> intersected East 106th Street near Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> intersected 116th, 126th, and 131st streets, {{then passed}} by Conner Prairie Interactive History Park. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> then crossed 141st and 146th streets, {{entering}} {{the city of}} Noblesville. Just south of downtown Noblesville, Allisonville Road turned north and becomes South 10th Street. In downtown, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> reached an intersection with SR 32/SR 38 (Conner Street). North of downtown, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> once again turned northeast and became Allisonville Road. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> then intersected East 191st Street.

50|$|K-17 was {{commissioned}} by 1932. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> went through Hutchinson and ended at US-81 south of McPherson. Only the portion from just south of Hutchinson {{to the city of}} Medora was paved. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> was gravel. Within a year, the segment from Medora to <b>the</b> <b>route's</b> northern terminus had been paved with a bituminous surface. Between 1933 and 1936, a stretch of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> in Reno County was also given a bituminous surface. In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>route</b> was extended north from its northern terminus along <b>the</b> <b>route</b> of US-81 to an intersection with K-4 in Saline County. By this time, all segments of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> had been paved. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>route</b> had a bituminous surface, but some segments had a hard surface. Between 1941 and 1945, <b>the</b> whole <b>route</b> was paved with a hard surface.|$|R
5|$|NY240 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY242 {{in the town}} of Ellicottville along the western leg of a railroad wye near Beaver Meadows Creek. NY240 proceeds northward alongside Beaver Meadows Creek co-designated as County Route32 (CR32; West Valley Road). <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> proceed northward through Ellicottville as a two-lane roadway through dense forestry, bending northward along the creek and a nearby railroad track. The dense forestry remains for several miles, before bending northeast into an intersection with Fancy Tract Road. NY240 and CR32 continue northeast as the dense woods retreat for residences before bending northwest away from Beaver Meadows Creek. After bending northward once more, <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> cross through large fields and past several houses along West Valley Road.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April 2002, SAS and Braathens split all <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> between them. SAS started {{flying on}} the main-haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger, {{with only a}} few flights to Stavanger flown by Braathens to get planes to the {{technical}} base there. From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway, all routes were taken over by Braathens, with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø. SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund, and Braathens increased their frequency on the route. Braathens retained <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown. Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona, Nice, Málaga and Alicante. This reduced the overcapacity in the market, and allowed the SAS Group to save between NOK600 and 900 million.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{the town}} water tower, NY16, NY78 and CR572 proceed {{northwest}} through Elma as a two-lane {{commercial and residential}} road, intersecting with the western terminus of CR528 (West Blood Road). <b>The</b> <b>routes</b> slowly becomes commercial once again, passing a large industrial building before entering an at-grade interchange with CR574 (Jamison Road). Before 1980, this intersection served as the western terminus of NY422. After CR574, NY16, NY78 and CR572 continue northwest along Seneca Street as a two-lane residential roadway through Elma. Bending northwest, <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> enter the hamlet of Spring Brook, where it intersects with CR140 (Rice Road) and CR362 (North Davis Road).|$|E
50|$|Highway 222 {{begins at}} Highway 51 near Donaldson in Hot Spring County. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> runs through Rolla to {{intersect}} Highway 9 in Lono. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> continues further east to enter Grant County, when <b>the</b> <b>route</b> meets Highway 229 in Carvers and terminates. <b>The</b> <b>route</b> was partially paved in 1991.|$|R
25|$|Several {{sources have}} noted that before <b>the</b> <b>route</b> {{authority}} was granted, Delta was virtually assured of being awarded <b>the</b> <b>route.</b> <b>The</b> DOT awarded <b>the</b> <b>route</b> to Delta on September 25, 2007.

5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which could count up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of <b>the</b> <b>routes,</b> while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport is}} served twice daily with a de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8 by Widerøe.

5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss.
