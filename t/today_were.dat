The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls {{of the city that}} still stand <b>today</b> <b>were</b> built around the 15th century by the Crown of Aragon.|$|E
5|$|Many of Weber's works famous <b>today</b> <b>were</b> collected, {{revised and}} {{published}} posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, teleological perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism.|$|E

All churches in existence <b>today</b> <b>were</b> built before the establishment of the Republic in 1923. A permit for the construction of a Syriac church was granted in December 2012, however, it was refused by the Assyrian community since the land used to be a Latin cemetery.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} Munich years Busch's {{attempts}} to write libretti, which are almost forgotten <b>today,</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful. Up to 1863 {{he worked on}} two or three major works; the third was composed by Georg Kremplsetzer. Busch's Liebestreu und Grausamkeit, a romantic opera in three acts, Hansel und Gretel and Der Vetter auf Besuch, an opera buffa of sorts, were not particularly successful. There was a dispute between Busch and Kremplsetzer during the staging of Der Vetter auf Besuch, leading to the removal of Busch's name from the production; the piece was renamed Singspiel von Georg Kremplsetzer.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{produce a}} vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication. Many of the drugs in use <b>today</b> <b>were</b> originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted <b>today</b> <b>were</b> established.|$|E

5|$|Depot Town {{was created}} after the Ypsilanti Train Depot was opened in 1838. As the {{railroad}} connected Ypsilanti, MI with Detroit, the area surrounding the depot grew. The commercial community known as Depot Town was {{built over the}} thirty years following {{the arrival of the}} railroad, and most of the buildings standing <b>today</b> <b>were</b> built from 1850 to 1880. In the early years, Depot Town included a flour mill, a large farmers' store, an iron foundry, a fire department, a clothing store, and paved streets. Ypsilanti's original city hall and jail were built just across the Huron River from Depot Town on West Cross Street. As the depot was built one mile north of the Chicago Road (now Michigan Avenue), the community of Ypsilanti was split between competing locations.|$|E
5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant <b>today</b> <b>were</b> executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards <b>today</b> <b>were</b> then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E

5|$|Depot Town is a {{commercial}} area, with some residences above storefronts, in Ypsilanti, Michigan's historic district. Depot Town proper consists of East Cross Street from the Huron River to North River Street, {{and a small}} area on the 300-block of North River Street. However, several blocks in the surrounding area are also {{commonly referred to as}} part of Depot Town. These areas include Riverside Park, Frog Island Park (both of which are on the Huron River), and River Street extending north and south for several blocks. First established in the late 1830s, most of the buildings standing <b>today</b> <b>were</b> constructed between 1850 and 1880. Over the years, Depot Town has included hotels, an Underground Railroad station, an American Civil War barracks, and a building that has housed a bar and restaurant continuously for more than 150 years, switching to soft drinks during Prohibition. Today the area is dominated by restaurants and stores. Depot Town also hosts several large summer festivals each year, as well as weekly bike nights and cruise nights.|$|E
