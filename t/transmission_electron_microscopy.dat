5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E

25|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (TEM, also {{sometimes}} conventional <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> or CTEM) is a microscopy technique {{in which a}} beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a charge-coupled device.|$|E
