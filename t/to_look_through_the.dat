5|$|On 20 August 1839 Meyerbeer, whilst {{relaxing}} at Boulogne in {{the company}} of Moscheles, {{met for the first time}} with Richard Wagner, who was en route to Paris. Their ensuing relationship (see below) was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both. At this meeting Wagner read to Meyerbeer from the libretto of Rienzi, and Meyerbeer agreed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> score, which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> history of biology {{from the ancient}} Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations {{should not be taken}} out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} in Shankar was examined {{in detail in}} an article by Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan. The authors question how accurately the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective, given that the test requires the court <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a reasonable observer in court who {{is familiar with the}} relevant facts, whereas most members of the public hear things from secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E

25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before {{the day of the}} flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E
500|$|Revenge of the Sith {{eventually}} {{became the first}} Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a [...] "tall guy" [...] in the Darth Vader costume, but after [...] "begging and pleading" [...] Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit. It also required Christensen (who is [...] tall) <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> helmet's mouthpiece.|$|E
500|$|Barry planned an enfilade, or what Christopher Jones, {{the former}} BBC {{political}} editor, has called [...] "one long spine of Lords' and Commons' Chambers" [...] which enabled the Speaker of the House of Commons <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{line of the}} building to see the Queen's throne in the House of Lords. Laid out around 11courtyards, the building included several residences with accommodation for about 200people, and comprised a total of 1,180rooms, 126staircases and [...] of corridors. Between 1836 and 1837 Pugin made more detailed drawings on which estimates were made for the palace's completion; reports of the cost estimates vary from £707,000 to £725,000, with six years until completion of the project.|$|E

The pertinency of the phrase, in spite of sorrow, is not intelligible.|$|R

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E
500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... I {{was fascinated by the}} mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E
2500|$|By this point, Li Kui {{also had}} the {{additional}} office of deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang). [...] He was displeased with how the officials {{in charge of the}} imperial examinations at the time were making their testing questions test highly obscure facts, and he believed that this led to the selection of examinees who were not necessarily talented or capable in writing. [...] He therefore, at the examinations, made the Confucian classics, histories, and qieyun references available to the examinees for them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> books during examination. [...] He was much praised for this reform. [...] It was also said that Li Kui was handsome in appearance and capable in rhetoric. [...] Emperor Suzong once told him, [...] "You, sir, are the highest grade in your clan's prominence, in your appearance, and in your writing." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{produce a}} {{detailed}} {{map of the}} perturbed surface density of neutral hydrogen in the outer Milky Way disk demonstrating that the Galaxy is a nonaxisymmetric multi-armed spiral. Spiral structure in the southern half of the Galaxy can be traced out to at least 25 kpc, implying a minimum radius for the gas disk. Overdensities in the surface density are coincident with regions of reduced gas thickness. The ratio of the surface density to the local median surface density is relatively constant along an arm. Logarithmic spirals can be fit to the arms with pitch angles of 20 ◦- 25 ◦. Mapping the Milky Way’s spiral structure is traditionally difficult because the Sun is imbedded in the Galactic disk; absorption by dust renders optical methods ineffective at distances larger than a few kpc. Radio lines like the 21 cm hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen (HI) are not affected by this absorption, and are therefore well-suited <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> disk. The density of HI is roughly proportional to {{the intensity of the}} emission, barring optical depth effects. Maps are constructed by using the Doppler shift of the emission line in combination with the rotation structure to determine where in the Galaxy the emission originates. The firs...|$|R

60|$|And then Alaric, pushing Mr. Embryo {{from his}} chair without much ceremony, sat down {{opposite}} to his former friend, and said and did {{what he had to}} say and do with an easy unaffected air, in which there was, at any rate, none of the usual superciliousness of a neophyte's authority. Norman was too agitated to speak reasonably, or to listen calmly, but Alaric knew that though he might not do so to-day, he would to-morrow, or if not to-morrow, then the next day; and so from day to day he came into Norman's room and transacted his business. Mr. Embryo got accustomed <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window at the Council Office for the ten minutes that he remained there, and Norman also became reconciled to the custom. And thus, though they never met in any other way, they daily had a kind of intercourse with each other, which, at last, contrived to get itself arranged into a certain amount of civility on both sides.|$|R
