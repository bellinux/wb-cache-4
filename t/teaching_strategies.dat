40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} showing {{the impact of a}} <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> called the Quantum <b>Teaching</b> <b>Strategy</b> on students’ academic achievements in two school subjects, namely in Bahasa Indonesia and Science, in comparison to that experienced through classes using a conventional <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy.</b> This research also examined the role of self-esteem on the students’ academic achievements in both the subjects in inclusive schools in Indonesia. Methodology – This {{research was}} a quasi-experimental study on two intact groups of sixth graders of two different inclusive schools. The sample was assigned through multi-staged cluster sampling from 78 elementary schools in 15 sub-district areas. The data on student academic achievements was collected by means of tests, while the data on self-esteem were obtained through a questionnaire. T-test was used to analyze the different impacts of the Quantum <b>Teaching</b> <b>Strategy</b> and conventional <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> on the academic achievements of students, while ANCOVA was applied to determine whether the students’ self-esteem influenced their academic achievements in Bahasa Indonesia and Science. Findings – The t-test showed that the Quantum <b>Teaching</b> <b>Strategy</b> had a better impact on both Bahasa Indonesia and Science achievements as compared to the conventional <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy.</b> Significance – Findings of this study {{can be used as a}} guide for planning and using Quantum <b>Teaching</b> <b>Strategy</b> in <b>teaching</b> and learning Bahasa Indonesia and Science in inclusive schools...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper uses {{experimental}} data {{to examine the}} existence of a <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> among boundedly rational players. If players realize that their own actions modify their opponents' beliefs and actions, they might play certain actions to this specific end and forego immedi- ate payoffs if the expected payoff gain from a <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> is high enough. Our results support {{the existence of a}} <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> in several ways. After exhibiting some regular- ities consistent with teaching, we examine more precisely the existence of such a strategy. First we show that players update their beliefs in order to take account of the reaction of their opponents to their own action. Second, we examine whether players actually use a <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> by playing an action that induces a poor immediate payoff but is likely to modify the opponent's behavior so that a preferable outcome might emerge in the future. We find strong evidence of such a strategy in the data and confirm this finding within a logistic model that suggests that the future expected payoff that could arise from a teach- ing strategy has indeed a significant impact on choice probabilities. Finally, we investigate the effective impact of a <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> on achieved outcomes and find that more tena- cious teachers can successfully use such a strategy in order to reach their favorite outcome at the expense of their opponents...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to find out whether there is a significant difference on the reading comprehension ability between the students who are taught using reciprocal <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> and those who are taught by using nonreciprocal <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy.</b> The design of this study was a quasi-experimental study. The study was conducted in SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Kalibawang. The population of the study included all the eighth grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Kalibawang in the academic year of 2012 / 2013. Two classes were selected using the cluster random sampling technique from the population as the experimental and control groups, i. e. Class VIII B and Class VIII A. There were 19 students in Class VIII B and 17 students in Class VIII A. Class B was chosen as the experimental group while Class A was chosen as the control group. The experimental group was taught by using reciprocal <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> whereas the control group was taught by using non-reciprocal <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy.</b> The data were collected by administering a pre-test and a post-test. The data were analyzed using ANOVA. The results of the data analysis are as follows. First, the mean score of the post-test in the experimental group (21. 84) is higher than that in the control group (17. 71). Second, there is {{a significant difference in the}} reading comprehension ability between both groups indicated by the ANCOVA results, in which the significance level is 0. 036 which is less than 0. 05 (F= 4, 592, p ˂ 0. 05). Therefore, the hypothesis of this research “There is a significant difference in the reading comprehension ability between the eighth grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Kalibawang in the academic year of 2012 / 2013 taught using reciprocal <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> and those taught without using reciprocal teaching strategy” is accepted.
