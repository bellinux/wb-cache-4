40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to calibrate <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors <b>of</b> SINS. According to <b>the</b> method, <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gyro and accelerometer can be calibrated simultaneously, which {{not depend on}} latitude, gravity, scale factor and earth's rotation rate. By the multi-position combinations, <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gyro and accelerometer are modulated into the sine and cosine functions, which can be identified respectively based on the least squares. In order to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis, the SINS is experimented by a three-axis turntable, and <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gyro and accelerometer are identified respectively according to the proposed method. After <b>the</b> compensation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> error, <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> the SINS is improved significantly...|$|R
