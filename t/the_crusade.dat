5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of <b>the</b> <b>Crusade</b> passed to Boniface of Montferrat, {{a friend of the}} Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert <b>the</b> <b>Crusade</b> to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, <b>the</b> <b>Crusade</b> {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky. Of the 113 individuals known by name to have been involved in <b>the</b> <b>Crusade,</b> 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery. Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, the experience of <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in <b>the</b> <b>crusade.</b>|$|E

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the unique {{phenomenon}} of society’s changing attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>Crusades.</b> Right from its inception <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> made a lasting impact on history, an impact which is still evident in the present day.

In current times there have been calls demanding an apology for <b>the</b> <b>Crusades,</b> while at <b>the</b> same time some within Christianity have felt the need to apologise for the atrocities of <b>the</b> <b>Crusades.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Crusades</b> are often blamed for the animosity between Christians and Muslims, a situation worsened by the fact that leaders on both sides misuse the word ‘crusade’ for their own agendas.

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of this {{term in the}} poem cannot be interpreted as showing influence from <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> in <b>the</b> poem; on the contrary, {{the way it is}} used in the poem, in which it is simply a Muslim land, indicates that the author of the poem was unacquainted with <b>the</b> <b>Crusades,</b> and that <b>the</b> term was in French before <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> began meaning <b>the</b> far side of the Mediterranean Sea.

5|$|The Siege of Damascus {{took place}} between 24 July and 29 July 1148, during the Second Crusade. It ended in a decisive crusader defeat {{and led to the}} {{disintegration}} of <b>the</b> <b>crusade.</b> The two main Christian forces that marched to the Holy Land in response to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Both faced disastrous marches across Anatolia in the months that followed, with most of their armies being destroyed. The original focus of <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> was Edessa (Urfa), but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus. At the Council of Acre, magnates from France, Germany, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem decided to divert <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> to Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> {{inspired}} the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various chansons de geste celebrating {{the exploits of}} Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the Chanson d'Antioche, are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to {{the legend of the}} Knight of the Swan. Together, the chansons are known as <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> cycle.|$|E
5|$|This double {{disaster}} {{destroyed the}} Pope's plans for <b>the</b> <b>crusade,</b> {{as he had}} envisaged it to land in Theodore's rear while he was engaged with Robert's army.

With news of the Latin defeats and the postponement of <b>the</b> <b>crusade,</b> the exhausted defenders of Thessalonica surrendered the city to Theodore sometime in December 1224. <b>The</b> <b>crusade</b> to relieve it sailed in March 1225, and landed in Thessaly at Halmyros. The Crusader army was soon decimated by dysentery, allegedly because the Greeks had poisoned the local water supply. William of Montferrat himself succumbed to it, and {{the remnants of the}} army left Greece. Demetrius of Montferrat still hoped to recover his realm with the help of Frederick II, but died in 1227.|$|E

5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as the year of <b>the</b> <b>crusade,</b> it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact}} that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before <b>the</b> <b>crusade.</b> Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of the main body of <b>the</b> <b>Crusade</b> were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks {{on their way to the}} Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E

5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> {{all the way to}} Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or <b>the</b> <b>crusade.</b> Henry and <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the legend}} of Henry is {{challenged}} by historians {{to the point of}} being labelled as pure imagination.

5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. <b>The</b> <b>crusade</b> seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for <b>the</b> <b>crusade</b> to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E

50|$|The mobs {{accompanying}} <b>the</b> First <b>Crusade,</b> {{and particularly}} <b>the</b> People's <b>Crusade</b> of 1096, attacked the Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and put many Jews to death.

About 12,000 Jews {{are said to have}} perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Before <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> <b>the</b> Jews had practically a monopoly of trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> raised up a class of merchant traders among the Christians, and from this time onward restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent. The religious zeal fomented by <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> at times burned as fiercely against the Jews as against the Muslims, though attempts were made by bishops during <b>the</b> First <b>crusade</b> and <b>the</b> papacy during <b>the</b> Second <b>Crusade</b> to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially <b>the</b> <b>Crusades</b> were disastrous for European Jews.
