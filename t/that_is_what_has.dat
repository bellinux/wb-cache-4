500|$|Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar {{termed the}} Chennai floods a [...] "natural {{disaster}} of unprecedented scale", {{and said it}} provided lessons to improve urban planning and improve city governance. [...] "Chennai gives a lesson, and we must learn from this lesson and improve our urban planning and improve city governance, which is very essential." [...] He also criticised the Chennai Corporation for not having done enough [...] "to remove all encroachments. Unless you allow the drains to flow freely to the sea, water will be clogged and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> unfortunately happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another sportswriter {{noted that}} the release of Peitz sounded a note of warning {{that led to the}} release of other old-time stars: [...] "The {{greatest}} must eventually fall, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to Peitz, [...] Kelley and others." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} of al-Qaeda's connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings in 2005, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: [...] "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> occurred here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate {{had looked}} {{surprised}} that, {{as a matter}} of taste on such an adventurer's part, Densher shouldn't see it. But Densher was lost in another thought. [...] "Do you mean that when, turning up myself, I found him leaving her, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taking place between them?" ...|$|R
50|$|The crew {{searched the}} ship but found {{no sign of}} her. Ships of the U.S. Coast Guard and Mexican Navy searched the {{international}} waters through which the Wonder had been sailing during the hours in which Coriam could have gone overboard, if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred. They, too, found nothing.|$|R
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> brought him to the edge of greatness. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2001, Wakefield {{resigned}} from the Royal Free Hospital, saying, [...] "I {{have been asked to}} go because my research results are unpopular." [...] The medical school said that he had left [...] "by mutual agreement". In February 2002, Wakefield stated, [...] "What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> caused the furore—because the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The year {{spent in}} Detroit was a {{difficult}} time for Kahlo. Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, {{as well as most}} Americans, whom she found [...] "boring". She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as Henry and Edsel Ford, and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests. In a letter to a friend, she wrote that [...] "although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States", she felt [...] "a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger." [...] Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy. Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective. Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in the marriage. Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks. Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.|$|E
60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST. You see, {{knowing how}} good a woman she is herself, she was {{naturally}} anxious that I should marry some one like her. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> made her watch your conduct so jealously, Mary.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he <b>had</b> done: he {{had taken}} the stable lantern and searched the garden for it.|$|R
5000|$|According to Goldman, when {{he first}} wrote the script and sent it out for consideration, only one studio wanted to buy it—and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{with the proviso that}} the two lead {{characters}} did not flee to South America. When Goldman protested <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened, the studio head responded, [...] "I don't give a shit. All I know is John Wayne don't run away." ...|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON (eagerly). Yes, my lord, it <b>is.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{striving to}} point out to your lordship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abused?" [...] quoth she, {{taking him}} up on the word. [...] "Abused, do you say?" [...] She laughed sharply. [...] "Say duped, my friend; for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{happened}} to you. You are {{the victim of a}} swindle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] I continued, [...] "Cousin Robert has {{happened}} to {{come in contact with}} them through business. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> made the difference in him. Before, he always knew they were corrupt, but he rarely thought about them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they often}} simply break the wings or {{otherwise}} terribly hurt {{the ones they}} shoot at, and then leave them to suffer, unable {{to take care of}} themselves. Oh, dear, I'm afraid <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to Mr. Quack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have come}} myself," [...] he said. [...] "But I didn't want a row with Mr. Higginbotham, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> would <b>have</b> surely happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it had {{got around}} your neck, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> would <b>have</b> happened. Reckon as how {{we had better}} git out o' this neighborhood, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And there's a tobacconist's now," [...] said Trannel, as if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>what</b> he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{looking for}} all along. [...] "I want some cigarettes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{affected}} me, I presume," [...] answered Captain Lee. [...] "Last {{night my}} head ached {{as if it}} would split open. We must tell the surgeon of this. Perhaps he can then do something to relieve Colonel Fairfield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Belle! do {{you really}} think there is {{anything}} in that? Do you think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> made Jessie act so queerly {{for the last couple of}} days? I noticed she was not herself at all; and Dave seemed to be different, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I saw {{the white}} doe eyes, {{full of the}} old {{pleading}} expression, and the lips quivering wistfully, but I only said to myself, [...] "The old arts! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> overthrown Fulk again;" [...] and away I went with a rigid bow, and said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--lower than me. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you <b>have</b> said, and I do {{not believe}} that you would say so falsely. You would not descend to flatter me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My father, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I <b>have</b> done. I {{have sent}} him to Napata, which is very much out of the way--many months' journey, I am told." ...|$|R
6000|$|JAMES [clinging to his manhood]. And fear of <b>that</b> wink <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{kept the}} two of us single men. And yet what's the glory of being single? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you think}} that he will not be sharp with us? 'More {{straight}} in your saddle!' 'lance lower!' 'head higher;' <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been ringing in my ears from morning till night of late, sometimes enforced by a sharp blow on the shoulders. Is it not so with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} lost my track {{completely}} after their bludgeon-man was arrested. Otherwise {{they could not}} have imagined that I had returned to my rooms. They have evidently taken the precaution of watching you, however, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> brought Moriarty to Victoria. You could not have made any slip in coming?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CLANDON (resolutely). Yes: I {{have not}} gone back one inch; and I have educated Gloria to take up my work where I left it. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> brought me back to England: I felt that I {{had no right to}} bury her alive in Madeira--my St. Helena, Finch. I suppose she will be howled at as I was; but she is {{prepared}} for that.|$|E
60|$|Harris {{thought at}} first of pretending <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> aiming at; but the crowd looked dangerous, {{and he decided to}} treat it as an accident.|$|R
60|$|She was abased now--woman as animal, though {{saved and}} uplifted by her power of immortality. Transcendental was her female power to link {{life with the}} future. The power of the plant seed, {{the power of the}} earth, the heat of the sun, the inscrutable creation-spirit of nature, almost the divinity of God--these were all hers because she <b>was</b> a woman. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> the great secret, aloof so long. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wrong with life--the woman blind to her meaning, her power, her mastery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Provocation. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> whether <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{done was}} enough to warrant an attempt to whip this other boy; for, as I {{understand}} it, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> really <b>what</b> he did try to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In these {{circumstances}} Gustavus of Sweden at once resolved {{to assist the}} Protestants in arms, and ere long will take the field. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> brought us here. Already in the Swedish army there are 10,000 Scotchmen, and in Denmark they also form {{the backbone of the}} force; and both in the Swedish and Danish armies the greater part of the native troops are officered and commanded by Scotchmen.|$|E
6000|$|... "It need {{have nothing}} to do with you," [...] he answered, [...] "if you are {{sensible}} enough to keep out of it. If I tell you: from this time onward it will be your trouble also.

But remember I have warned you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will be {{much better}} off without him. Surely your terrible {{experiences}} of that awful night have told you that Jeeves needs a rest. The keenest of thinkers strikes a bad patch occasionally. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to Jeeves. I have seen it coming on for some time. He has lost his form. He wants his plugs decarbonized. No doubt this is a shock to you. I suppose you came here this morning to seek his advice?" ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Callies {{was cast}} in the major role of Lori Grimes on the AMC horror/drama series The Walking Dead, based on the comic-book series of the same name. The drama became the highest-rated show in that cable channel's history. Callies played the role from the show's start until season three. Grimes, her family, and friends are forced to fight {{relentless}} evil {{in the form of}} both flesh-eating zombies and the few surviving humans. Callies convinced the show's writers to kill her character because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred in the comic-book version.|$|R
60|$|Joseph had sat and sat where John and Jacob Stuck {{had left}} him on his box of silver money, until a band of thieves had come along and robbed him of it all. John had carried away his pockets and his hat full of gold, and had lived like a prince {{as long as it}} had lasted. Then he had gone back for more, but in the {{meantime}} some rogue had come along and had stolen it all. Yes; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened, and now they were as poor as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "He thinks so; does he? I suppose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Maria <b>has</b> told him. Oh, Mr. Eames, {{you don't}} know the meanness of women; you don't, indeed. Men {{are so much}} more noble." ...|$|R
