40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{integrated}} model for evaluating <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development initiatives used by the Botswana public service. To achieve this goal, the following actions were taken: A literature study was conducted to identify the scope and impact of an effective <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development initiative and its evaluation; A literature study was conducted to identify strategies for evaluating <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development initiatives. The theoretical study focused on effective <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development strategies and their evaluation and critical organisational factors that contribute to successful training evaluation; The findings from the literature study were integrated into a model for evaluating <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development initiatives to be used by the Botswana public service; and  This model was used as the basis for the development of a survey questionnaire to determine whether trainers, <b>training</b> managers <b>and</b> supervisors who were responsible for <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development in the public service agreed with the effective strategies for evaluating <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development developed in the study. The survey was conducted in ministries and departments in the south east district of Botswana, mainly in Gaborone, where ministries and government departments are located. The empirical results from the study showed that the majority of respondents’ <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development activities were not evaluated and that there is no link between <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development and performance management. In particular, disagreements were shown with regard to ten strategies and critical organisational factors. Evaluation of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development in general, is an issue that organisations are challenged with on a daily basis. Lack of skills by trainers on how to evaluate <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development is one major contributing factor to this problem. An integrated and strategic approach towards the evaluation of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> development is required to effectively <b>and</b> constructively <b>train</b> <b>and</b> development employees according to strategic organisational goals, rather than according to individual trainee’s goals...|$|R
