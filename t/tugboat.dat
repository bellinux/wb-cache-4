5|$|At the 1990 Survivor Series, Hogan and <b>Tugboat</b> {{were members}} of the Hulkamaniacs team in a match against the Natural Disasters team, which {{included}} Earthquake and Bravo. Hogan eliminated Bravo, and <b>Tugboat</b> and Earthquake were both counted out while fighting each other. The Hulkamaniacs won the match, with Hogan as the only wrestler remaining at the end. During the 1991 Royal Rumble match, Hogan eliminated his friend <b>Tugboat.</b> Hogan and Earthquake were the final two wrestlers at the end; Hogan eliminated Earthquake to win the match. <b>Tugboat</b> later turned heel and changed his name to Typhoon; he and Earthquake formed a tag team known as The Natural Disasters.|$|E
5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and <b>tugboat</b> assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one <b>tugboat</b> was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available <b>tugboat</b> could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage <b>tugboat</b> capable of towing a large ship off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the <b>tugboat</b> from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days. Salvage Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.|$|E

5|$|Many years later, in September 2002, {{one of the}} unexploded torpedoes that U-47 {{had fired}} during the attack on Royal Oak rose to the surface from its resting place on the bottom. The unexploded torpedo, minus its warhead, {{gradually}} drifted towards the shore, where it was spotted by a crewman aboard the Norwegian tanker Petrotrym. A Royal Navy <b>tugboat</b> intercepted the torpedo, and after identifying it as having belonged to U-47 63 years earlier, EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) personnel discarded it a mile from shore.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the <b>tugboat.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a <b>tugboat</b> in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{seagoing}} <b>tugboats,</b> harbour <b>tugboats</b> {{are generally}} smaller and their width-to-length ratio is often higher, {{due to the}} need for a lower draught. In smaller harbours these are often also termed lunch bucket boats, because they are only manned when needed and only at a minimum (captain and deckhand), thus the crew will bring their own lunch with them. The number of <b>tugboats</b> in a harbour varies with the harbour infrastructure and the types of <b>tugboats.</b> Things to take into consideration includes ships with/without bow thrusters and forces like wind, current and waves and types of ship (e.g. in some countries there is a requirement for certain numbers and sizes of <b>tugboats</b> for port operations with gas tankers).|$|R
40|$|The use of “Standard Maneuvering Orders” for <b>tugboats,</b> {{vocabulary}} and phrases mutually pre-agreed between ships and <b>tugboats,</b> {{is essential for}} the former to provide clear direction for the latter when berthing or un-berthing safely. <b>Tugboats</b> will need time to change their posture before they take actions in response to orders from persons responsible for ships’ maneuvering. Therefore, when giving directions to change tugboats’ posture, persons who handle their ships are required to send out tug orders, with regard to “delay time,” a gap be-tween the orders from ships and the actions taken by <b>tugboats.</b> “Tug Orders” standardized and used in Japan are composed of the following three factors concerning towage work: <b>tugboat’s</b> motion, direction and engine power, but the author’s research shows that there are “Non-standard” special maneuvering orders other than those “standardized,” which causes such problems as a gap in perception between pilots and <b>tugboat’s</b> opera-tors, etc. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to research the delay time between orders for and actions by <b>tugboats</b> and consider the appropriate and safe timing of providing instructions to them, and then to propose globally-authorized “Standard Maneuvering Orders for tugboats”, discussing a problem involved in the use of the special orders used in Japan, and the way in which tug orders are used in other countries...|$|R
25|$|Bandicoot and Wallaroo {{were built}} by Mipe Shipbuilding for Singaporean company Maritime (PTE) Ltd. as the <b>tugboats</b> Grenville VII and Grenville V, and entered service in 1982. The two <b>tugboats</b> were {{purchased}} by the RAN for the Craft of Opportunity Program (COOP) on 3 and 8 August 1990, and were delivered on 11 August 1990. The <b>tugboats</b> underwent conversion to serve as auxiliary minesweepers, with modifications completed by mid-1991.|$|R
5|$|Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince {{left the}} company in 1937. He was {{commissioned}} by Harper's Bazaar for {{an article on the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to use him in further issues, and he also took commissions from Town and Country to supplement his income. Vogue invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate work for him. He chose to work for Life magazine, starting with a piece called The <b>Tugboat.</b> Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. Life refused to publish the unauthorized photographs. Kertész resented the constraints on his curiosity.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, he {{returned}} to the legislature, representing Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat. While in the legislature, he worked to get a $30,000 government subsidy to purchase and operate a large steam <b>tugboat</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy <b>tugboat</b> Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
50|$|Thea Foss {{established}} Foss tug in Tacoma in 1889. Foss <b>tugboats</b> {{have the}} longest and most expansive history in the area. Many of the small logging firms had <b>tugboats</b> for mills at Port Gamble, Bellingham, Everett, Port Ludlow and Olympia.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tugboats</b> {{are used}} to {{maneuver}} vessels by pushing or towing them. Tugs are needed to move vessels that either should not move by themselves, such as large ships in a crowded harbor or a narrow canal, or those that can not move by themselves, like as barges, disabled ships, or log rafts. [...] <b>Tugboats</b> are powerful for their small size and are strongly built. Early <b>tugboats</b> used steam engines, but most have diesel engines now. Many <b>tugboats</b> have firefighting [...] water canons, allowing them to assist in firefighting, especially in harbors. Some minesweepers like the USS Vireo (AM-52), USS Lark (AM-21) and USS Kingfisher (AM-25) were converted to ocean tugs for the war.|$|R

5|$|Izumo {{participated in}} the 1919 Naval Review by Emperor Taishō. She was re-designated a 1st class coast-defense ship on 1 September 1921 and used {{primarily}} for training duties in long-distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. In this capacity, she participated six voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to Europe, North and South America, and Oceania, including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922 with Yakumo. Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes Kuni Asaakira and Kachō Hirotada. While in Vancouver, British Columbia, on 7 February 1925, {{on one of these}} cruises, a <b>tugboat</b> collided with one of the ship's boats at night, drowning 11 crewmen.|$|E
5|$|Offshore Virginia, swells {{generated}} by the storm stranded a <b>tugboat</b> and injured two people. Waves along the coast also caused beach erosion, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Inland, effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall. More than 100campers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12. Although near-hurricane-force wind gusts pelted coastal areas of Virginia and North Carolina, wind damage from the storm was minimal. The remnants of the storm brought rainfall to portions of New England, especially to Connecticut, where precipitation from the storm peaked at 4.62in (117mm). Damage from the storm was unknown, but presumed to be minimal.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{purchased}} for C$817,500 by the Royal Canadian Navy {{and she was}} commissioned on 15 June as HMCS Ottawa. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt on 7 November 1938. She remained there until she was ordered to Halifax, Nova Scotia on 15 November 1939 where she escorted local convoys, including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December. Ottawas stern was damaged in a collision with the <b>tugboat</b> Bansurf in April 1940, and repairs took two months to complete.|$|E

5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, {{she was the}} flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, and along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border {{during the first few}} days of the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, the monitors' navigation was difficult, and they were scuttled by their crews on 11 April. Some of her crew may have been killed when a demolished bridge collapsed onto a <b>tugboat</b> after they abandoned ship. A number tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most were obliged to surrender to the Germans at Sarajevo on 14 April. The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor, where they were captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, seven {{casualties}} {{occurred in}} the Laguna province, while one person perished each in San Pablo, Batangas, Marinduque and Mindoro Oriental. Thirty-twopeople {{were killed in the}} Camarines Sur province and 23other lives were lost in Camarines Norte. Five others were killed in the Masbate province, and one died in Marinduque. In Boac, the capital of Marinduque, 80%of all dwellings lost their roofs and damage was severe to churches, schools and city buildings. In Bacacay, situated to the southeast of Legaspi, all but 15of the town's 200dwellings were leveled. Although there were no deaths, Samar Island also suffered severe damage. Offshore, five fisherman perished and a <b>tugboat</b> and cargo ship were rendered missing due to rough seas. Nina also brought widespread power outages to most of Luzon; consequently, trading on the nation's two biggest stock exchange was suspended for November 26.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a <b>tugboat</b> in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E

5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the <b>tugboat</b> Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November Belfast {{was taken}} off the {{northern}} patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, Belfast was {{to take part in the}} force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58am she struck a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke Belfasts keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast. The <b>tugboat</b> Krooman, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up.

During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby <b>tugboat</b> Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
