40|$|Most European Union {{rules are}} made by the Commission, not the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament. But {{although}} the Commission is an important rule-maker, it is not autonomous. The member states have always taken care to install committees to control the Commission (comitology). However, the Lisbon Treaty introduced alternative control mechanisms (delegated acts) and a reform of the comitology system (implementing acts). This article investigates how the post-Lisbon control system works in daily legislative practice. It represents the first investigation of the institutional preferences of the Council, the Parliament and the Commission in the new system. Further, it utilizes better data than previous studies. The analysis is based on data on the control preferences of all actors before the first <b>trilogue</b> <b>meeting</b> for {{a large number of}} cases in the period 2010 â€“ 13. The results indicate that the institutional battle over the control of delegated rule-making is far from over...|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of the European integration process, together with the {{evolution of}} EP's role as co-legislator have produced {{an increase in the}} number of the <b>trilogue</b> <b>meetings</b> [...] During 2009-2014 legislative term, when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force and the co-decision procedure became ordinary legislative procedure - establishing the role of the EP and the Council of the EU as co-legislators - 85% of legislative acts were approved in first reading, 13% were approved in second reading while only 2% were included in the conciliation procedure. This trend corresponds to {{an increase in the number}} of trilogues (over 1500 in the same period) and it is seen as a proof of the effectiveness of the trilogues in fast tracking the legislative procedure [...]|$|R

It examines {{the extent to which the}} plenary draws its legislative position on the basis of the draft committee reports under the codecision procedure. It is expected that the committees' impact is substantially decreased if an early agreement is reached with the Council of Ministers in informal <b>trilogue</b> <b>meetings.</b> Furthermore, due to the open amendment rule in plenary committees are expected to be more successful if the legislators drafting their reports have no special outlying interests, have relevant expertise, and are affiliated with big party groups. These hypotheses are tested on an original data set of the codecision reports which passed first reading in the 6 th EP (2004 - 2009). The findings suggest that indeed informal trilogue agreements significantly undermine committees' legislative influence while rapporteurs' profiles do not have a significant effect on the adoption of committee reports in plenary...|$|R
