5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. <b>The</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
5|$|From the 4th century {{through to}} the 6th century the use of talud-tablero {{architecture}} became notable in the Mundo Perdido.

5|$|Intelligence {{agencies}} expressed {{shock at}} the highly sophisticated weapons that the militants in the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa compound had, and began {{an investigation into}} where the equipment came from. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said that a suicide bomber had detonated himself in the mosque located at {{the opposite side of}} the complex to the seminary. Arshad also said a second suicide bomber had detonated himself in the white-domed mosque. In total, it took 36 hours to fully secure <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> remove the booby traps.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, in Monte Carlo, Bond follows Xenia Onatopp, {{a member}} of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a {{suspicious}} relationship with Charles Farrel, a Canadian Navy admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with her thighs during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them to board a French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, Siberia, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet electromagnetic weapon satellites from the Cold War. They program the first GoldenEye (Petya) to destroy <b>the</b> <b>complex,</b> <b>and</b> escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in Saint Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{building}} in the complex is the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Situated next to the Hills Capitol and the Huston Capitol, {{it was built in}} 1894. It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan Legislative Office Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest {{building in}} <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office and Reception Room.

5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5|$|Travis assumed {{command of}} the Alamo {{garrison}} on February 11, when Neill was granted a furlough.

As they rushed to the Alamo, Texians quickly herded cattle into <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a siege of the Alamo and raised a blood-red flag signalling no quarter. Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon.|$|E
50|$|Inside the nucleus, {{the host}} protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75, {{commonly}} referred to in abbreviated form as LEDGF/p75, binds to <b>the</b> preintegration <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> host DNA.

The sequence of binding of the LEDGF/p75, the host DNA, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> preintegration <b>complex</b> remains unclear. In one version, the LEDGF/p75 binds first to <b>the</b> preintegration <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> then to <b>the</b> host DNA. On the other hand, LEDGF/p75 may bind first to the host DNA and then to <b>the</b> preintegration <b>complex.</b> Regardless of <b>the</b> sequence, {{it is believed that}} the presence of LEDGF/p75 results in the integrase dimers approaching each other to form a tetramer.|$|R

5|$|While the SSG {{secured the}} ground floor of the mosque, they {{continually}} received fire from the mosque's minarets. This slowed the operation's progress. On the mosque roof, militants had piled sandbags {{at the base of the}} minarets, which they now used as steps to shoot at troops below. After the minarets were taken, the SSG progressed deeper into <b>the</b> <b>complex,</b> <b>and</b> the militants threw gasoline bombs in an unsuccessful attempt to set fire to the mosque and stop the assault. Once {{the ground floor}} was secured, the SSG attempted to enter the Jamia Hafsa madrasah adjoining the mosque but were delayed by booby traps, which had to be disabled before they could continue into the complex.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{returns to}} Erinsborough and sets {{fire to the}} Lassiter's complex. He also kills Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), when Gus catches him. Paul helps rebuild <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. Paul strikes a deal with Affirmacon to build on Ramsay Street and he gets his protégé Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) to pollute the local wetlands. When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken to the bush and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22. Paul begins a relationship with Izzy and his estranged daughter Elle moves in. To celebrate the Lassiter's Hotel 20th anniversary, Paul and several of his neighbours go on a joy flight to Tasmania. During the flight, a bomb explodes causing the plane to crash into the sea. Paul, Izzy and Elle survive.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Trinity River and dealt F1or greater damage to {{over a hundred}} homes in the {{adjacent}} subdivision. Some roofs sustained partial roof loss and many large trees either lost limbs or were toppled. At the intersection of West Sixth Street and University Drive, the tornado abruptly turned east from its initial southeast heading, bringing it over the Linwood subdivision at around 6:22p.m. CST (00:22UTC). The homes in the neighborhood were mostly small, wood-framed structures on pier or beam foundations, making them highly vulnerable to the tornadic winds and resulting in widespread structural failure. A {{survey conducted by the}} Wind Damage and Engineering Program at Texas Tech University later concluded that many of the buildings that suffered total structural failure did so due to structural deficiencies rather than the strong winds associated with the tornado. The tornado then passed over a Montgomery Ward distribution center, causing roof damage to <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> overturning numerous parked trucks; one person was killed while trying to reach shelter after a truck fell on them. Another person was killed after being struck by a collapsing brick wall. Together, these two fatalities represented the only deaths associated with the Fort Worth tornado and the overall tornado outbreak. Several nearby metal buildings were toppled before the tornado once again crossed the Trinity River, entering Fort Worth's central business district.|$|E
