Over each ditch is a series of hoops, initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch <b>tapers.</b> The hoops are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net-covered hoops is known as a pipe.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that <b>tapers</b> towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted <b>tapers</b> carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tapered</b> key is <b>tapered</b> only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a <b>taper</b> that matches that of the <b>tapered</b> key. Some <b>taper</b> keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the <b>taper</b> is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with <b>taper</b> keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a <b>tapered</b> shaft lock in that <b>tapered</b> keys have a matching <b>taper</b> on the keyway, while <b>tapered</b> shaft locks do not.|$|R
50|$|<b>Taper</b> — The <b>taper</b> of a file {{refers to}} the gradual {{increase}} in diameter along its working surface. NiTi rotary files usually have a higher <b>taper</b> compared to the <b>taper</b> of standard traditional hand files which is 0.02 mm/mm (ISO <b>taper</b> of endodontic files, <b>taper</b> 0.02 mm/mm indicates 20 microns increase in diameter for every 1 mm gain in {{the length of a}} file). Their <b>taper</b> commonly ranges from 0.02 to 0.12 mm/mm. Different systems are sometimes classified according to their <b>taper</b> which can be constant or variable.|$|R

5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} <b>tapers</b> {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which <b>tapers</b> gradually.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that <b>tapers</b> down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the <b>taper</b> {{variation}} in root canal preparations among Twisted Files and PathFiles-ProTaper. 08 <b>tapered</b> rotary files to current standards. Methods. 60 root canals with severe angle of curvature (between 25 ∘ and 35 ∘) and short radius (< 10 [*]mm) were selected. The canals were divided randomly into two groups of 30 each. After preparation with Twisted Files and PathFiles-ProTaper to size 25 <b>taper.</b> 08, the diameter was measured using computed tomography (CT) at 1, 3, and 16 [*]mm. Canal <b>taper</b> preparation was calculated at the apical third and at the middle-cervical third. Results. Of the 2 file systems, both fell within the ±. 05 <b>taper</b> variability. All preparations demonstrated variability when compared to the nominal <b>taper.</b> 08. In the apical third, mean <b>taper</b> was significantly different between TF and PathFiles-ProTaper (value < 0. 0001; independent -test). Mean <b>Taper</b> was significantly higher with PathFile-ProTaper. In the middle-cervical third, mean <b>Taper</b> was significantly higher with TF (value = 0. 015; independent -test).

5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar <b>tapers</b> at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Spores {{are roughly}} {{ellipsoidal}} in shape with a Q ratio (the fraction of length/width) of 1.6, and dimensions of 9.4–15.4 by 6.2–9.0μm. They have a small, oblique , lack oil droplets, and are smooth with thin walls, and hyaline (translucent). The spores are acyanophilous and strongly amyloid, meaning they stain with Methyl blue and Melzer's reagent, respectively. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored (rarely two-spored) and club-shaped with long, robust sterigmata up to 6.0μm long; they have clamp connections at their bases, and measure 35.3–49.6 by 10.3–14.4μm. Roridomyces austrororidus has {{two types of}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges). One is rare, broadly club-shaped, and <b>tapers</b> to a narrow stem; it measures 24.1–39.5 by 6.8–12.7μm. The other cheilocystidia are moderately dense to abundant, and form a sterile gill edge. They are cylindrical, measuring 27.5–70.4 by 5.4–10.4μm, and often have a swollen tip that splits into two, rarely three branches.|$|E

5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which <b>tapers</b> to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle.

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and <b>tapers</b> rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400.

5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, {{and the concept of}} taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to be pressed and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between <b>tapers.</b> The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.|$|E
