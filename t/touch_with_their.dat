The applications are composed {{according to the}} user preferences collected via a physical user interface. This interface allows users to specify preferences by simple actions of <b>touching</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mobile terminals icons in the environment, instead of explicitly selecting resources and dealing <b>with</b> <b>their</b> properties.

As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|R

The newspaper continues in print to this day and publishes a beginners guide to the Irish language, helping Irish Argentines keep in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> cultural heritage.

25|$|A two-year Massey University {{survey of}} 30,000 people, {{published}} in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results {{were consistent with}} those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to stay in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.|$|E

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissatisfied}} customers {{complained to}} Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which handles consumer protection issues. Officials there got in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> counterparts at the FTC in the U.S. They {{were able to}} take action due to the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers Beyond Borders Act of 2006, commonly known as the SAFE WEB Act, which Congress had passed at the commission's request to help them coordinate actions against Internet fraudsters who operate across international boundaries with similar agencies in other countries, such as OFT. Most relevant to its case against Karnani, the legislation had clarified that the FTC had authority over American companies that did business exclusively with customers abroad. Its action against Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite was the first it had undertaken against one.|$|E

500|$|From {{a broader}} labor perspective, Hayden {{commented that the}} lockout was [...] "rather pedestrian" [...] and [...] "made no {{noteworthy}} contributions to legal doctrine." [...] He considered the NBPA to be a union that had more power, and a greater ability to enter a labor dispute, than most other labor organizations, which he believed to hold weaker positions comparatively. In addition, Hayden noted that a contrast existed between the work activities of regular workers and NBA players, as perceived by typical employees, and that [...] "the NBA lockout may have strengthened {{the view of many}} that unions are out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives and thus have little to offer them." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{prevent the}} serious renewal of warfare in the spring, it was {{considered}} essential to replace Marlborough with a general {{more in touch with}} the Queen's ministers and less in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> allies. To do this, Harley (newly created Earl of Oxford) and St John first needed to bring charges of corruption against the Duke, completing the anti-Whig, anti-war picture that Jonathan Swift was already presenting to a credulous public through his pamphleteering, notably in his Conduct of the Allies (1711). The means to achieve Marlborough's fall had already been put in train when the Ministry had set up a Parliamentary [...] "Commission for the taking, examining and stating the public accounts of the Kingdom", to report on alleged irregularities during the war.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Nestlé Purina Petcare {{introduced}} a sponsored email application, Doggie-Mail, that could send messages online through a talking dog. In 2009 it sponsored the PawNation.com site developed by AOL, which hosted crowd-sourced pet videos, tips, Q and other content about pet ownership. Purina also sponsored Martha Stewart's pet tips site, Living Omnimedia. The company {{introduced a}}n advertising {{campaign for the}} Alpo brand with the slogan [...] "Real dogs eat meat". In the ad, over-pampered pets were [...] "rescued" [...] and fed Alpo, implying that pets needed to stay in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> primal nature by eating real meat. In 2009 it released a free iPhone app called [...] "petcentric places" [...] that allows users to map local pet-related locations, like dog parks or pet-friendly hotels. In 2010, Purina released a branded Facebook game called Purina Pet Resort, where players manage a virtual pet resort.|$|E

The relations among the members of the herd are very tight; when a female gives birth, the rest of the herd acknowledges it by <b>touching</b> her <b>with</b> <b>their</b> trunks. When an old elephant dies, the rest of the herd stays by the corpse for a while. The famous elephant graveyards are false, but these animals have recognized a carcass of their species when they found one during their trips, and even if it was a stranger, they formed around it, and sometimes they even <b>touched</b> its forehead <b>with</b> <b>their</b> trunks.|$|R

500|$|In September 2015, Tancharoen {{stated the}} overall {{theme for the}} season {{explored}} with each character was them [...] "trying {{to get back in}} <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> humanity in a world where Inhumans are popping up," [...] with Whedon adding that the nature of couples–some having broken up in previous episodes, some getting back together, and potential for new ones–would be explored. Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have all these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at the same time, I think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the Falcon, where they played a still shambolic, but better gig in front of record executives. Meanwhile, [...] George had put the band in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> first manager, Richard Lowe from MRM management. They made further appearances on Welsh television to support the release of Hooked in May, but another drunken performance followed, this time in Newport. MRM sent them on a short tour in France during {{the second week of}} May, and then started their first UK wide support tour to the band Salad. When due to perform at the Cnapan Music Festival in Wales on 2 July, the band ran into some difficulties. The security team refused to let Matthews in as they didn't recognise her. It was only after the intervention of one of the fans of the band, actor Rhys Ifans, that she was allowed in.|$|E
500|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} as a mass organization, formed around a core of prewar officers. Home Army soldiers fell into three groups. The first two consisted of [...] "full-time members": undercover operatives, living mostly in urban settings under false identities (most senior Home Army officers belonged to this group); and uniformed (to a certain extent) partisans, living in forested regions (see [...] "forest people"), who openly fought the Germans (the forest people are estimated at some 40 groups, numbering 1,200–4,000 persons in early 1943, but their numbers grew substantially during Operation Tempest). The third, largest group were [...] "part-time members": [...] sympathizers who led [...] "double lives" [...] under their real names in their real homes, received no payment for their services, stayed in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> undercover unit commanders but were seldom mustered for operations, as the Home Army planned to use them only during a planned nationwide rising.|$|E
