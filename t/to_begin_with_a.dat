5|$|The large {{budget and}} notable talent {{for the project}} made it {{difficult}} for the production company to secure directors willing to take on the series, causing 2009 <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brief stir of media attention. Shortly thereafter, Taewon announced that the search was over and Kim Kyu-tae and Yang Yun-ho would be helming the series. Simultaneously, KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster. Later in the month, on February 19, Kim So-yeon was cast as a North Korean agent.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi {{would also have to}} return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E

5|$|The Season Nine DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include: more scenes from the Q panel; Pete discussing what he learned working at Dunder Mifflin; Angela's sister, Phyllis, and Andy giving toasts at the wedding; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories; and the office taking one of the potted plants outside and planting it in actual soil. The episode originally was scripted <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different cold open; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim, in which Dwight is {{led to believe that}} he is actually living in the Matrix, a computer-simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name. The scene was either not filmed, or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes. A table read of it—along {{with the rest of the}} episode—was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{productive}} {{language is}} considered <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stage of preverbal communication in which infants use gestures and vocalizations {{to make their}} intents known to others.

25|$|Their {{life cycle}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which {{is followed by}} fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions {{taken up by the}} cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E

500|$|Gould {{favored the}} {{argument}} that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term [...] "progress". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because life is constrained <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple starting point (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived {{to move in the}} direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, {{as is often the case}} with parasites.|$|E

500|$|The key to Disston's Florida plans was {{a massive}} {{dredging}} effort to drain the Kissimmee River floodplain that flows into Lake Okeechobee, to remove the surface water in the Everglades and the surrounding lands regardless of season. The canals were engineered to guide the overflow of Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River {{and then into the}} Atlantic Ocean in the east; the Caloosahatchee River overflow was directed to the Gulf of Mexico in the west, and eventually canals were to be constructed south through the Everglades. [...] Disston was advised <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large canal connecting Lake Okeechobee with the St. Lucie but the prohibitive costs forced him to begin with smaller dredging operations to straighten the Kissimmee River and to connect Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee.
