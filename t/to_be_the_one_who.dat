Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in the church resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head.

5|$|After {{a quarrel}} with Barkis, and realizing {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness {{the same way it}} was stolen from her. She stops Victor from drinking the poison and reunites him with Victoria. Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, unknowingly drinking the cup of poison.

Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance {{towards the end of}} the film, but {{according}} to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was killed. The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative. To satisfy the studio heads, he shot a second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss, Thomas Bateman, being interviewed on television. Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original.|$|E

Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> got to do it." [...] In an interview with E!

[...] Delany {{said she did not}} know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E
500|$|Carla is {{the eldest}} of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is {{somewhat}} seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. [...] "As the therapist in the family Carla likes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> understands everything" [...] and [...] "has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self-improvement". [...] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother. Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal-retentive. [...] In Carla’s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, [...] "Trespass", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car.

President Van Buren was nominated for a second term, but the convention made no endorsement for vice president. The incumbent, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was controversial because he lived with an African American woman, and the influential former president, Andrew Jackson, insisted that Johnson be dumped from the ticket. Johnson, who had fought under Harrison during the War of 1812, was popular in the western states as an Indian fighter (he was alleged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> killed Tecumseh), and Van Buren stalled. The lack of an endorsement left the matter up to state parties, and Johnson's rivals soon withdrew, leaving him as the de facto [...] vice presidential candidate.|$|E

500|$|The staff {{struggled}} {{throughout the}} writing process to decide which Winchester would be kidnapped and possessed, and were forced to revise the script multiple times to reflect the latest choice. Because of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's recurring role on Grey's Anatomy, however, the writers realized {{that he would not}} be available long enough to be a main focus of the episode. They thus decided late into production for John <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> is captured. With this finalized, Kripke found it rather easy to write the episode; he already knew that the key elements of the episode would be the exorcism of the demon possessing Meg, the death of the real Meg, and the apparent rescue of John Winchester. Kripke felt that it had to be John who was possessed by Azazel, as it united and completed the two main storylines of the seasonfinding their father and tracking down the demonand it did so by finding both characters in one body. He found it a [...] "happy accident" [...] to be able to present the brothers with the opportunity to finally kill the demon, but at the cost of their father's life.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Falk and Yacoub, co-produced by Tuinfort and Ilya, with vocal production being done by Ilya, Kotecha and Yacoub. [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
