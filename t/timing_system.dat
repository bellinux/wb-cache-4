5|$|The Waendel Leisure Centre is {{the main}} council-owned leisure centre in Wellingborough. The {{facility}} includes a six-lane 25 metre competition pool, varying in depth from 1 to 2 metres, and used for many purposes including the main training pool for Wellingborough Amateur Swimming Club. The pool is regularly used for small competitions, as other than Corby Pool {{it is the only}} other aptly equipt facility - boasting new starting blocks, as well as an integrated <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> and time board. The pool also has a small, shallow, 'teaching' pool, more suitable for non swimmers. Waendel also operates a newly refurbished gym on the upper level.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one-hour between 13:00 to 14:00 CEST, each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps, with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position. Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer <b>timing</b> <b>system,</b> which measured to an accuracy of one-thousandth of a second. At {{the end of the}} session, the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime, the first time this had happened {{in the history of the}} World Championship. Jacques Villeneuve was first to set a time of 1:21.072, fourteen minutes into the one hour session. A further fourteen minutes later, Michael Schumacher posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, Heinz-Harald Frentzen crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, Damon Hill, in his Arrows, with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama's Minardi.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> recording birds’ arrival has never been easier. The ETS technology is developing year on year and it is taking over pigeon world, changing it and making it fit for today’s conditions. As {{a result of this}} new way of registering a bird’s arrival, several loft management software have been created in the last 10 years to help fanciers with record keeping, pigeon pedigree, publishing race results or keep track of treatment and vaccination records.|$|E

25|$|At these championships, {{there was}} an {{automatic}} <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> that was both on the slalom canoer's bib and on the course itself. There were a total of ten antennas on the course that once an electronic marker in a canoer's bib approaches an antenna, it triggered video camera and timing controls. These course antennas were located at the start line, the finish line, and eight points in between. This system was used as video feed for the championships. It was an automatic system that times in the 1/100ths of a second and is uploadable on any Windows or Mac computer.|$|E
25|$|Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not {{designed}} {{as a test of}} fundamental physics, it must account for the gravitational redshift in its <b>timing</b> <b>system,</b> and physicists have analyzed timing data from the GPS to confirm other tests. When the first satellite was launched, some engineers resisted the prediction that a noticeable gravitational time dilation would occur, so the first satellite was launched without the clock adjustment that was later built into subsequent satellites. It showed the predicted shift of 38 microseconds per day. This rate of discrepancy is sufficient to substantially impair function of GPS within hours if not accounted for. An excellent account of the role played by general relativity in the design of GPS can be found in Ashby 2003.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{development}} and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic <b>Timing</b> <b>System.</b> The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier {{does not even}} have to be at the loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock is attached to the antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps the {{earliest}} [...] "performance" [...] theory was the [...] "delay line" [...] hypothesis of Valentino Braitenberg. The original theory {{put forth by}} Braitenberg and Roger Atwood in 1958 proposed that slow propagation of signals along parallel fibers imposes predictable delays that allow the cerebellum to detect time relationships within a certain window. Experimental data {{did not support the}} original form of the theory, but Braitenberg continued to argue for modified versions. The hypothesis that the cerebellum functions essentially as a <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> has also been advocated by Richard Ivry. Another influential [...] "performance" [...] theory is the Tensor network theory of Pellionisz and Llinás, which provided an advanced mathematical formulation of the idea that the fundamental computation performed by the cerebellum is to transform sensory into motor coordinates.|$|E

2500|$|To host such a major event, Tokyo's {{infrastructure}} {{needed to}} be modernized in time for large numbers of expected tourists. Enormous energy and expense was devoted to upgrading the city's physical infrastructure, including new buildings, highways, stadiums, hotels, airports and trains. [...] There was a new satellite to facilitate live international broadcast. [...] Multiple train and subway lines, a large highway building project, and the Tokaido Shinkansen, the fastest train in the world, were completed. Haneda International Airport and the Port of Tokyo were modernized. International satellite broadcasting was initiated, and Japan was now connected to {{the world with a}} new undersea communications cable. The YS-11, a commercial turboprop plane developed in Japan, was used to transport the Olympic Flame within Japan. For swimming, a new <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> started the clock by the sound of the starter gun and stopped it with touchpads. The photo finish using a photograph with lines on it was introduced to determine the results of sprints. All of this demonstrated that Japan was now part of the first world and a technological leader, {{and at the same time}} demonstrated how other countries might modernize. [...] In preparation for the games, 200,000 stray cats and dogs were rounded-up and euthanized.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota {{opted to}} develop the car to {{minimise}} {{the impact of the}} 2013 Technical Regulations which increased the minimum weight of manufacturer Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) vehicles by [...] by focusing on fine-tuning the engine for power improvement, efficiency and reliability. They also manufactured new chassis tubs consisting of a narrower front nose because the need to have an option to operate the hybrid system on the front wheels was no longer required. The company had limited resources, so they elected to run one TS030 Hybrid for the entire WEC season with a second vehicle participating in selected rounds including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The first race of the season, the 6 Hours of Silverstone, saw Toyota bring two 2012-specification cars in place of the updated 2013 chassis. Nakajima was absent from Silverstone because of a Super Formula commitment. Despite a <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> malfunction that prevented lap times from being published for more than one hour, the No. 7 and No. 8 Toyota cars qualified in first and second place, separated by nearly two seconds. However, the event was at best uneventful, with neither car being able to match either Audi's pace, finishing third and fourth overall having struggled in the first few hours of the race with tyre management.|$|E

Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by Oxford Nanoscience and CAMECA respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. [...] The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments. [...] In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials. [...] AMETEK acquired CAMECA in 2007 and Imago Scientific Instruments (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.|$|E
