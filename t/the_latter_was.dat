5|$|After {{his father}} died in 1077, John {{remained}} in his grandfather's estates in Thrace, and was raised by him. It was there that he learned of the rebellion of Alexios Komnenos against Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–1081) in 1081, and {{it was he who}} informed the Caesar of it.

50|$|Books II and III of DDC enumerate {{all kinds}} of signs and explain how to {{interpret}} them. Signs are divided into natural (naturalia) and conventional (data); <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> divided into animal (bestiae) and human (homines); <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> divided into non-words (cetera) and words (verba); <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> divided into spoken words (voces) and written words (litterae); <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>is</b> divided into unknown signs (signa ignota) and ambiguous signs (signa ambigua); both the former and <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> divided respectively into particular signs (signa propria) and figurative signs (signa translata), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans. In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (lectio), textual criticism (emendatio), explanation (enarratio), and judgment (iudicium), one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).|$|R

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>was</b> also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>was</b> discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century.

5|$|Bus. M-28 was {{originally}} {{a section of}} M-28 before <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>was</b> realigned in the late 1930s. The highway carried the M-28A designation before it was redesignated as Bus. M-28 in 1950. The trunkline was partially turned back to local control in 1953, and the business loop designation was removed at that time. The section of the roadway in downtown Newberry has carried several different designations {{in addition to the}} original M-28.|$|E

The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E
5|$|From 1888 to 1910, a {{new series}} of fortifications were built to house breech-loading guns.
