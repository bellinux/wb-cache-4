25|$|It took Thomas {{over two}} weeks to move, causing great anxiety in Washington, where it was {{anticipated}} that Hood was poised for an invasion of the North. General Grant pressured Thomas to move, despite a bitter ice storm that struck on December 8 and stopped much fortification on both sides. A few days later, Grant sent an aide to relieve Thomas of command, believing that Hood would slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> On December 13, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was directed to proceed to Nashville and assume command if, upon his arrival, Thomas had not yet initiated operations. He made {{it as far as}} Louisville by December 15, but on that day the Battle of Nashville had finally begun.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} league {{campaign}} {{at home to}} Fulham on 12 August 2007. A mistake by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, [...] "screw an attempted return pass against his own knee", allowed striker David Healy to score, just under 52 seconds. However, a late penalty scored by Robin van Persie and a goal from Alexander Hleb resulted in the team winning the match. In their next match, away to Blackburn Rovers, another error by Lehmann – this time letting David Dunn's shot slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and into the goalnet, meant the team drew 1–1. Cesc Fàbregas scored the winning goal against Manchester City, ten minutes {{before the end of}} the match. The result was followed with what The Guardian described as a [...] "fluent attacking display" [...] at home to Portsmouth, on the first day of September. Arsenal faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur after a week-long international break and went a goal behind when Gareth Bale’s free-kick beat goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, past the net. Emmanuel Adebayor scored the equaliser in the second half, before Fàbregas [...] "piloted a 30-yarder beyond Paul Robinson in the 80th minute." [...] In stoppage time, Adebayor flicked the ball up and volleyed it into the top corner of Tottenham's goal; the result meant Arsenal went top of the league table, for the first time in the season. A week after, Adebayor scored a hat-trick (three goals) in a 5–0 win against Derby County. Van Persie scored the only goal against West Ham United on 29 September 2007 to maintain the lead at the top.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{one could}} {{from time to}} time imagine a feel of the American players Sonny Rollins or Johnny Griffin in Morrissey's work, he was {{outstanding}} among British players for his originality. Despite the sophistication of his ideas there was often a down-home quality to his punchy and hard swinging solos, and this was a reflection of one of his idols, the tenorist Stanley Turrentine. He was a lightning improviser and the flood of his inventions flew <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> with ease, for he was a masterful player." ...|$|E

2500|$|DC/DS Ronald Rycott; Detective Constable Ronald [...] "Kenny" [...] Rycott (played by Peter Childs) {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Episode 3, [...] "The Smaller They Are". Rycott previously had a 'spot of bother', which prevented him from rising through the ranks, although, he later became a Detective Sergeant. A lone figure, not afraid of violent situations and {{more than willing to}} do a bit of [...] "freelance" [...] work, he was frequently {{on the edge of a}} nervous attack as Arthur slipped <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> Rycott appeared in another 14 episodes up to the end of Series 7. His regular assistant was: ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{administration}} officials, {{torn between}} {{pressure from the}} Republicans to go forward and a reluctance to respond to any Iraqi confrontation (and there was sure to be one) with military force, had tried to convince Butler to postpone the inspection until [...] "a more opportune time." [...] Butler was convinced. To me, he called it a case of [...] "bad timing." [...] I viewed it as something elsean appalling lack of leadership, not only in Washington and London, but also on Butler's part. He was allowing a golden opportunity to slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> I said as much in a long, critical memorandum that I wrote to him the next day.|$|E

50|$|Huntsman {{possessed a}} mind that spread through skin contact, placing those he touched under his control, presumably by {{spreading}} nanites <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clawed <b>fingers.</b> He also possessed a coral-shaped exposed glowing brain, presumably {{the source of}} his powers. The process used to breed Huntsman also endowed him with massive musculature and immunity to telekinetic powers.|$|R
60|$|Fawsitt seated {{himself on}} the other side of the table. He had a long, thin face, dark, narrow eyes, unwholesome complexion, a {{slightly}} hooked nose, and teeth discoloured <b>through</b> constant smoking. <b>His</b> <b>fingers,</b> too, bore the tell-tale yellow stains.|$|R
60|$|Bradley {{smiled back}} at him in his wordless way, and caught hold of the first ear. It sent a shiver of pain <b>through</b> him. <b>His</b> <b>fingers,</b> worn to the quick, {{protruded}} from his stiff, ragged gloves, and the motions of clasping and stripping the ear were like the rasp of a file on a naked nerve. He shivered and swore, but his oath was like a groan.|$|R
60|$|At {{that word}} {{the young man}} let his glass slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> and looked upon Keawe like a ghost.|$|E
60|$|She {{was fairly}} driven into a corner; but (being a woman) {{she tried to}} slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> at the last moment.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not finish}} it. He {{picked up a}} handful of pop-corn, let it run <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> looked at her wistfully.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{suffered}} {{himself to}} be led and seated by the fire, but, after retaining {{for a long time}} the very posture which he assumed in sitting down, he suddenly changed it in order to wring his hands with an air of the bitterest distress, and then, spreading them before his face, wept so plentifully, that the tears found their way in floods <b>through</b> <b>his</b> slender <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
60|$|Brooks sat as one stupefied, {{and then}} a sudden warm touch upon his hand sent the blood {{coursing}} once more <b>through</b> <b>his</b> veins. Sybil's <b>fingers</b> lay for a moment upon his. She smiled kindly at him. Lord Arranmore's voice once more broke the short silence.|$|R
6000|$|An ominous chill ran <b>through</b> <b>his</b> veins, and for {{an instant}} the reins slipped <b>through</b> <b>his</b> relaxed <b>fingers.</b> Good God! Could this have been what Donna Maria meant, or had there been a later {{convulsion}} of Nature? He looked around him. The vast, far-stretching plain, desolate and trackless as the shining ocean beyond, took upon itself an awful likeness to that element! Standing on the brink of the revealed treachery of that yawning chasm, Arthur Poinsett read the fate of the Rancho. In the storm that had stirred the depths of this motionless level, the Rancho and its miserable inmates had foundered and gone down! ...|$|R
60|$|As he did so, he {{uttered a}} {{surprised}} exclamation. He ran the jewels <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> He scrutinized them again, more closely this time.|$|E

60|$|What had {{happened}} was simple. The cook, endeavoring {{to take a}} turn of the line too late, had failed, and the hemp ran <b>through</b> <b>his</b> half-frozen <b>fingers,</b> chafing the skin from them. Seeing Thurston floundering in his direction over the boulders, he valiantly strove to check it, regardless of the pain until it was whipped clear of his slackening grasp and the trolley rushed downwards towards the torrent. Thurston was abreast of it before it splashed in, and had just time to see its occupant, still clutching the rope, drawn under by the sinking wire, before he plunged recklessly into the foam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, bad, or indifferent," [...] she said, [...] "the pupil's {{sketches}} {{must pass}} through the fiery ordeal of the master's judgment--and there's an end of it. Suppose we take them {{with us in the}} carriage, Laura, and let Mr. Hartright see them, for the first time, under circumstances of perpetual jolting and interruption? If we can only confuse him all through the drive, between Nature as it is, when {{he looks up at the}} view, and Nature as it is not when he looks down again at our sketch-books, we shall drive him into the last desperate refuge of paying us compliments, and shall slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> professional <b>fingers</b> with our pet feathers of vanity all unruffled." ...|$|R

60|$|Turning to the Third Act, Henry looked wearily at {{the pages}} as he let them slip <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> Both {{in mind and}} body, {{he began to feel}} the need of repose.|$|E
