25|$|After {{the success}} of Chocolat, Binoche was internationally {{recognized}} as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician in Jet Lag opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box-office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film {{tells the story of}} a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her Chocolat persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.|$|E

[...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> {{in some way or}} another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E

500|$|As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, {{moving the}} ball sharply either way {{and able to}} make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused {{opposition}} batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching. He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall. He was always willing <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman. Compton said that Miller [...] "often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run". Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test. Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he [...] "never felt physically safe against him". His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place {{at the base of his}} spine before sending down the next delivery.|$|E
500|$|There {{was much}} {{improvisation}} in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had {{focused on the}} story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> each time. It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor, and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon. Bridges described this approach as [...] "a $200 million student film", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were {{trying to come up}} with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded. The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set. The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least making an effort <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while".

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Body Language received an average score of 62 based on 17 reviews {{which indicates that}} the album received [...] "generally favourable reviews". Chris True from AllMusic complimented Minogue for expanding her [...] "horizons" [...] and felt that the album was consistent {{and worked as a}} [...] "piece", calling it [...] "stylish without being smarmy, retro without being ironic". He favoured the overall production of the album and praised Minogue for displaying a [...] "sense of class", which he felt was lacking in the work of female artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Madonna; he concluded by labelling Body Language a [...] "near perfect pop record" [...] and [...] "what may well be the best album of her [...] career". Keith Caulfield from Billboard was also positive in his review and complimented Minogue for selecting a talented creative team, saying [...] "The sexy, solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers." [...] The Irish Times review of the song called the album a [...] "worthy successor to 2001's smash hit Fever, a supremely danceable collection of electro-pop songs that's clearly in thrall to the 80s" [...] and complimented Minogue's versatile vocal delivery. Ethan Brown from New York was greatly impressed by opening track [...] "Slow", and commented that most of the songs on the album [...] "mimic its sound, none of the other songs on Body Language comes close to the achievement of [...] "Slow"". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt Body Language was a better album than Fever, calling it [...] "less immediate and more experimental, a midway point between the alternative/electronica of 1997's Impossible Princess and Minogue's more mainstream post-millennium work", and praised it for being cohesive. He also complimented Minogue's [...] "willingness <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> – even if it's within the confines of dance-pop – is what's made her an international sensation 15 years running". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone favoured the sensual nature of the album, calling it [...] "fantastic" [...] and that [...] "At thirty-five, she's ten times hotter than she was ten years ago – on Body Language, Kylie Minogue definitely sounds like she has a few more tricks stored on her hard drive than Britney [...] or Christina [...] ".|$|E
