According to Minami, the titles were unique and creative, and it was courageous of Sega to publish these risky titles. Minami added further that the partnership with Sega allowed them <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> titles to Western markets. The three games included: MadWorld, Infinite Space, and Bayonetta. Each was released in 2009. All the intellectual properties created by PlatinumGames as part of the partnership are owned by Sega.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. <b>To</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> {{areas to}} life, the level {{designers}} produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts {{based on those}} designs. Finding an appropriate color palette for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was {{an important component of}} the game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended level of detail and allow the game's console versions to fit into the devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player should have had their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control rather than showing them in cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was being}} {{pressured}} by the divisional commander {{to increase the speed}} of the advance, Whitehead was said to be reasonably happy with the progress being made by the 2/48th along the central route, although he had misgivings about the performance of the 2/23rd on the left and the 2/24th on the right. To some extent, the failure of the 2/24th to take the 2,200 feature could be attributed to the importance which the Japanese commander, Katagiri, placed upon its defence, however, Whitehead believed that the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Gillespie, was procrastinating and being overly cautious in his tactics. Nevertheless, it was later realised that the terrain which the 2/24th faced was more formidable than first thought, and that in order for the battalion to make progress, they too, like the 2/48th, would need tanks. Some attempt was made by the Australians <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> up from the rear areas, but ultimately the fighting around Sattelberg came to an end before this could be effected. On the brigade's left, south of the main route, the pace of the 2/23rd's advance had also caused Whitehead some concern. Indeed, Whitehead went as far to express this to the 2/23rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Tucker, who pointed out that his lack of progress had been caused by the large number of tasks that the battalion had been assigned, namely the competing demands to secure the flank while attempting to move quickly through broken country in order to make its scheduled rendezvous with the 2/48th.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{approach}} of the devastating Assyrian armies would {{more often than not}} result in the vassalage of these states.

The result is that numerous Kings of Assyria launched campaigns <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> economically important regions under Assyrian rule. The rebellion after one King's offensive would result in his successor's next vengeful assault. When Tyre ceased to pay tribute to the Assyrian kings, rebellion broke out.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, an {{entrance}} is a procession {{during which the}} clergy enter into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors.

Over the centuries, these processions have grown more elaborate, and nowadays are accompanied by incense, candles and liturgical fans.

Eager <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour {{of the city and}} asked him to pick his spot.

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water is}} essential for the survival of all plant life. In a grapevine, water acts as a universal solvent for many of the nutrients and minerals needed to carry out important physiological functions, and the vine receives these by absorbing the nutrient-containing water from the soil. In the absence of sufficient water in the soil, the root system of the vine may have difficulties absorbing these nutrients. Within the structure of the plant itself, water acts as a transport within the xylem <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>these</b> nutrients to all ends of the plant. During the process of photosynthesis, water molecules combine with carbon derived from carbon dioxide to form glucose, which is the primary energy source of the vine, as well as oxygen as a by-product.|$|E
