5000|$|Acceptance {{tests are}} created when the {{requirements}} are analyzed and prior to coding. [...] They {{can be developed}} collaboratively by requirement requester (product owner, business analyst, customer representative, etc.), developer, and tester. Developers implement the system using the acceptance tests. Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met. The tests are specified in business domain terms. The terms then form a ubiquitous language that is shared between the customers, developers, and testers. <b>Tests</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> are interrelated. A requirement that lacks a test may not be implemented properly. A test that does not refer to a requirement is an unneeded test. An acceptance test that is developed after implementation begins represents a new requirement.|$|E

50|$|The IRS in 2010 {{announced}} it would increase standards for return preparers as well as institute <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> continuing education <b>requirements.</b> Prior to the IRS Return Preparer Initiative, anyone could call himself or herself a tax return preparer regardless of age, experience or training. The IRS {{conducted a series of}} public hearings with tax preparers, associations and consumer advocates and the result was the Return Preparer Review. The initiative required all tax return preparers to register with the IRS and obtain a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). It required certain preparers to pass a competency <b>test</b> <b>and</b> complete 15 hours of continuing education credits annually. Exempt from the <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> CE <b>requirements</b> were Certified Public Accountants, attorneys and Enrolled Agents because they already have <b>testing</b> <b>and</b> education <b>requirements</b> for their credentials. Also exempt were non-1040 tax return preparers and non-signing preparers who are supervised by CPAs, attorneys or Enrolled Agents and work at firms 80 percent owned by CPAs, attorneys and Enrolled Agents. Tax preparation volunteers were exempt from all initiative provisions.|$|R
40|$|In {{a testing}} process, the design, selection, {{creation}} and execution of test cases is a very time-consuming and error-prone task when done manually, since suitable and effective test cases must {{be obtained from the}} requirements. This paper presents a model-driven testing approach for conceptual schemas that automatically generates a set of abstract test cases, from requirements models. In this way, <b>tests</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> are linked together to find defects as soon as possible, which can considerably reduce the risk of defects and project reworking. The authors propose a generation strategy which consists of: two meta-models, a set of transformations rules which are used to generate a Test Model, and the Abstract Test Cases from an existing approach to communication-oriented Requirements Engineering; and an algorithm based on Breadth-First Search. A practical application of our approach is included. Cuencavol. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Testing is a {{relevant}} activity {{for the development}} life-cycle of Safety Critical Embedded systems. In particular, much effort is spent for analysis and classification of test logs from SCADA subsystems, especially when failures occur. The human expertise is needful to understand the reasons of failures, for tracing back the errors, {{as well as to}} understand which requirements are affected by errors and which ones will be affected by eventual changes in the system design. Semantic techniques and full text search are used to support human experts for the analysis and classification of test logs, in order to speedup and improve the diagnosis phase. Moreover, retrieval of <b>tests</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements,</b> which can be related to the current failure, is supported in order to allow the discovery of available alternatives and solutions for a better and faster investigation of the problem.

40|$|Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are {{the most}} modern {{measurement}} devices for electric power networks. Their performance, in terms of synchrophasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurement accuracy are crucial for the overall performance of the network management and control applications {{that are expected to}} rely on PMU-based distributed measurement systems. In this regard, PMU performance should be assessed under different conditions. IEEE standard C 37. 118. 1, which is particularly focused on PMUs for power transmission systems, reports <b>tests</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> for PMU compliance. However, some important operating conditions are neglected. In particular, the presence of unbalance in the three-phase system appears relevant for an advisable application of PMUs to distribution networks. In this paper, the impact of unbalance on two important classes of PMU algorithms is discussed. Analytical formulas are derived to estimate the effect of unbalance on synchrophasor, frequency and ROCOF estimations, and they are verified by means of numerical simulations...|$|E
