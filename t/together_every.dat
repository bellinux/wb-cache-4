Most such legends, however, are regarded as folktales rather than actual events. In Islamic mysticism, however, Elijah is associated closely with the sage Khidr. One legend reported that Elijah and Khidr met <b>together</b> <b>every</b> year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca. Elijah appears also in the Hamzanama numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drunk from the Fountain of Youth.|$|E

25|$|Diwali is {{a five-day}} festival {{in many regions}} of India, with Diwali night {{centering}} on the new moon – the darkest night – {{at the end of}} the Hindu lunar month of Ashvin and the start of the month of Kartika. In the Common Era calendar, Diwali typically falls towards the end of October, or first half of November each year. The darkest night of autumn lit with diyas, candles and lanterns, makes the festival of lights particularly memorable. Diwali is also a festival of sounds and sights with fireworks and rangoli designs; the festival is a major celebration of flavors with feasts and numerous mithai (sweets, desserts), as well as a festival of emotions where Diwali ritually brings family and friends <b>together</b> <b>every</b> year.|$|E

500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] is a dance-pop {{track with}} themes of indie pop, {{and has been}} {{compared}} to the work of M.I.A. and Daphne & Celeste. The verses, choruses and bridge are all distinctively different; the chorus consists of chants, the verses are spoken-sung (half spoken. half sung), and the bridge are dancehall themed. The bridge gathered comparisons to the music of Major Lazer, which it samples. The vocals are performed against sirens. Music journalist James Montgomery observed how the song [...] "mashes <b>together</b> <b>every</b> notable pop moment from recent history", pointing out the dancehall rhythms, drum breaks and [...] "electro-vocal tics".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{was voted}} number 25 on MTV's 25 Best Songs of 2011.

That's thanks mostly to the supercharged, sing-a-long chorus, where the whole thing comes together in a head-spinning rush. She should go solo more often." [...] The song was also listed on Billboard magazine's Best Songs of 2011 list at number 14. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was listed as The Guardians 14th best song.|$|E

Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence: [...] "The team pulled <b>together</b> <b>every</b> strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of it all... was Philip Smith.

500|$|While the Beatles were <b>together,</b> <b>every</b> song {{written by}} Lennon or McCartney was {{credited}} as Lennon–McCartney {{regardless of whether}} the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, Please Please Me, which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called Wings over America, which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as [...] "Yesterday," [...] but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making [...] "an attempt to rewrite history".|$|E

In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled [...] "Conflagration" [...] in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.|$|E

500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put <b>together</b> <b>every</b> piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in Plenty, believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E

[...] Various sociologists, anthropologists and historians have rejected the racial origins and racial emphasis of caste and consider the idea to be one that has purely political and economic undertones. Beteille writes that [...] "the Scheduled Castes of India taken together are no more a race than are the Brahmins taken <b>together.</b> <b>Every</b> social group cannot {{be regarded as a}} race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination", and that the 2001 Durban conference on racism hosted by the U.N. is [...] "turning its back on established scientific opinion".|$|E
