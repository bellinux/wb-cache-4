5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin, the A4 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway's national significance is reflected in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest <b>transport</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

Based on the case study of several public <b>transport</b> <b>routes,</b> this paper explores this new development model which gives priority to public transportation. The author studies the background, the operation features and the innovative values of these routes. The study proves that public <b>transport</b> <b>routes</b> will not only solve the transport difficulties, but will also enhance the policy of public transport priority...|$|R

5|$|The main <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> to {{the power}} station for fuel (originally coal) is train via a -long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal {{do not need to}} be shunted after being {{unloaded}}. Merry-go-round trains are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|E

Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had a connection to the mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. The arched bridge in use today was constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The A2 {{motorway}} is {{an important}} north–south motorway in Croatia, connecting {{the capital of the}} country, Zagreb, to Graz, Austria, via Maribor, Slovenia, as well as Vienna and other destinations along the Pyhrn route. The motorway follows a route through the Hrvatsko Zagorje region. Part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is also part of European route E59 Zagreb–Graz–Vienna–Prague. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of economic development, especially for tourism and as a transit <b>transport</b> <b>route.</b> The road carries significant transit and tourist traffic as it connects to the Zagreb bypass segment of the A3 motorway, which serves as a hub distributing the southbound traffic to either eastbound A3 or southbound A1, and vice versa. As of the June 1997 Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, the motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor Xa.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the first}} {{skirmish}} in Pakrac in March, a predominantly Serb-populated area {{east of the}} town, straddling the Pakrac–Bučje–Požega road, remained generally {{beyond the control of}} Croatian authorities. In early July, the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora. This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin–Osijek road, as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina. After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia (SAO Western Slavonia) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani, the most significant <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> between Zagreb and Slavonia—the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška—was severed. SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements. In order to address this deficiency, Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August. The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje, Daruvar, Pakrac and Lipik, and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia. The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar, but the line of control remained in close proximity to the four towns.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{various levels}} of {{government}} in the Socialist Republic of Croatia initiated planning processes aimed at development of road transport infrastructure of the then constituent republic of Yugoslavia. The first proposal of a motorway link in Croatia was made by Josip Roglić, {{a member of the}} Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts at the time. He proposed the motorway to be built between Zagreb and Split. In 1962, a formal proposal was made by local authorities in Split, resulting in Croatian government adopting a framework motorway development plan in 1966. Designs were commissioned in 1967, extending the route north to Maribor, Slovenia for the first time. The extension largely used the same corridor as an existing ZagrebMaribor roadZagorje Highwaya congested and insufficiently safe two-lane road with at-grade intersections, connecting numerous towns and villages between Zagreb and Maribor. The road itself represented yet another upgrade of a <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> recorded along ZagrebMaribor corridor since Middle Ages. The plan was shelved because of political pressures following suppression of Croatian Spring only to be reinstated upon Croatian independence from Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The {{communist}} {{movement in}} Cambodia and Vietnam began before World War II with {{the founding of}} the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese, originally meant to fight French colonial rule in Indochina. In 1941, Nguyen Ai Quoc (commonly known by his alias Ho Chi Minh) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or the Viet Minh. When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, he initiated the first Indochinese war of independence against the French. During this time, Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons, supplies, and troops. This relationship lasted throughout the Vietnam War, when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> and staging area for attacks on South Vietnam. In 1951, Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), which allied with a nationalist separatist Cambodian movement, the Khmer Serei (Free Khmers), in order to pursue independence. In accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords negotiating the end of the French domination, newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia; however, since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage, approximately 5,000 Communist cadres went with them.|$|E
5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a <b>transport</b> <b>route.</b> Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease {{operations in the}} area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E

5|$|Perched {{high above}} the River Seine, an {{important}} <b>transport</b> <b>route,</b> the site of Château Gaillard, in the manor of Andeli, {{was identified as a}} naturally defensible position. In the valley below the site was the town of Grand Andely. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (January 1196) between Richard and Philip II neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build a castle at Andeli. Its purpose was to protect the duchy of Normandy from Philip II—it helped fill a gap in the Norman defences left by the fall of Château de Gisors and above all Château de Gaillon, a castle which belonged to Philip and used as an advanced French fortification to block the Seine valley—and to act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the Norman Vexin from French control. Indeed Les Andelys is located just in front of Gaillon {{on the other side of}} the Seine valley. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in northern Normandy, on the border with Picardy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Church.|$|E
