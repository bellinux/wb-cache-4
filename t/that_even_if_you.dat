500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make you laugh, but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't chuckle once, you can still have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E
500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review in Time that the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute". He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her [...] "grand designs" [...] and [...] "configurations of enormous powers" [...] with [...] "passages of aching poignancy". Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|E

5000|$|Schwarzman {{received}} a severe backlash from both {{critics of the}} private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. The lavish event which reminded many of the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). David Rubenstein, the founder of The Carlyle Group remarked, [...] "We have all wanted to be private - at least until now.

2500|$|In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts {{published}} the graphic novel adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, Ghetto Klown. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in Queens, New York, {{his involvement in}} '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, {{and some of the}} colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." [...] The comic [...] is illustrated by Christo Cassano.|$|E

5000|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} completed by Blackstone intensified the level of attention directed toward the private equity industry overall as media commentators focused on the large payout received by the firm's CEO Steve Schwarzman. [...] Schwarzman received a severe backlash from both critics of the private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. An ill-timed birthday event {{around the time of}} the IPO led various commentators to draw comparisons to the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). David Bonderman, a co-founder of the private equity firm TPG Capital, remarked, [...] "We have all wanted to be private- at least until now.
