[著者抄録]冷凍パン生地による食パンの製造につき実験を行なった。実験区分として、発酵前生地冷凍、第 1 発酵生地冷凍、第 2 発酵生地冷凍の 3 区分を設定、貯蔵目数の限界もあわせて検討した。解凍法についても併せて追究した。(1) 発酵前生地冷凍区: 自然解凍区では、一般製法とまったく差異のない食パンの製造が可能で、すだちの形成もきわめて良く、芳香性に富んだ軽い感じの色調豊かな品質を示した。急速解凍区では、生地はべとつき、急激な温度差により、イースト菌の発酵能力が衰弱し、発酵不良の結果をまねき製品は自然解凍区に比較してかなり劣悪であった。(2) 第 1 発酵生地冷凍区: 自然解凍区では、解凍前のイースト菌の発酵形跡は若干認められるが非常に弱く生地内部はもち状となり、その結果、製品食パンは重い感じの粗悪なアルコール臭の強い膨張率の低い不良品となった。急速解凍区では、CO_ 2 の放出は非常に弱くイースト菌の発酵力は大きく低下、生地はだんご状となる。その結果、製品食パンはほとんど膨張せず異臭の強い、不均質な内面の劣悪な品質となり、本区での食パン製造は不適当である。(3) 第 2 発酵生地冷凍区: 自然解凍区では、生地はべとつき、第 2 発酵以前に形成された"すだち"や空胞が消失し、もち状となり製品食パンは粗悪な重い感じを呈する。また、異臭も強く、膨張率も低いかたい食パンとなった。急速解凍区では、伸長性に乏しいだんご状の発酵不充分な生地で、第 2 発酵以前に形成された健全なイースト菌の発酵が解凍時にはほとんど消失した。製品食パンは急速解凍区と大差なく、その品質はかなり劣悪であり、本区での食パン製造は非常に困難であった。以上の結果より、冷凍生地による食パン製造は発酵前生地を冷凍する方法が最良であるが、各家庭で冷凍生地購入後焼き上げるまでの処理が複雑なため、なお幾多の改良や製法の簡素化が必要であろう。すをわち、第 2 発酵終了後の冷凍生地を購入、焼き上げのみで食パンが得られるべく、種々の改良、研究が必要であろう。その一方法として、第 2 発酵終了の冷凍生地に解凍時イースト菌、糖などを添加し、イースト菌の発酵能力の促進、補強などが考えられる...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{freezing}} {{technology is}} well established in industrial and craft bakeries and is still gaining importance. In order to optimize recipes and processes of frozen baked goods, {{it is essential to}} be able to investigate the products' microstructure.

In this study, frozen wheat bread <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> investigated by confocal Raman microscopy. The Raman spectra measured within <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>were</b> compared with spectra of the main components of frozen dough, i. e. ice, liquid water, starch, gluten and yeast.

The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|E

25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>is</b> rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
