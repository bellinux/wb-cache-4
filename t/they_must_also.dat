5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> {{learn not}} to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a {{pinball game}} {{developed}} by Jupiter, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, {{and was released}} {{in the same year}} – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is based on Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and is a sequel to Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color. In some ways, it plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball in play as long as possible and hitting bumpers. In keeping with the theme of Pokémon, it features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> capture the eponymous creatures.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} {{to run for the}} Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen and be at least 25 years old. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> have lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, may serve in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state government may serve, except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.|$|E
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E

5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the Paths of the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E
