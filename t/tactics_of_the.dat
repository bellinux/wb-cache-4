5|$|The Winter War, {{an attempt}} by the Soviet Union to take {{territory}} in Finland in late 1939 demonstrated superior winter <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish Army, regarding over-snow mobility, camouflage, and use of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} the American Civil War and at Lissa were very {{influential}} on the designs and <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ironclad fleets that followed. In particular, it taught a generation of naval officers the lesson that ramming {{was the best way}} to sink enemy ironclads.|$|E
5|$|Just as the armour {{and weapons}} {{of the late}} army were {{fundamentally}} {{similar to those of}} earlier eras, so the army's tactics were based on traditional principles. The key elements of systematic scouting, marching formation, battle array, fortified camping, and siegecraft were all followed intact in the late period. This section examines aspects of late tactics that differed significantly from <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principate.|$|E

50|$|Grand Battery (Grande Batterie, meaning big {{or great}} battery) was a French {{artillery}} <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Napoleonic wars.

5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield. A common <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives was to concentrate themselves in strongly-defended mountaintop fortresses.|$|R
5|$|The {{battle is}} known through two {{detailed}} accounts, Anna Komnene's Alexiad, {{and her husband}} Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger's Material for History, on which Anna's own account relies to a large degree. It {{is one of the}} few Byzantine battles described in detail, and hence a valuable source for studying the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine army of the late 11th century.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{citizens}} {{were said to}} be shocked by the emotive, evangelical <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salvation Army when they arrived in the town in 1880, but the reaction from those employed by the breweries or within the Licence trade quickly grew more openly hostile. Violent clashes became a regular occurrence culminating on Sunday 27 March 1881 with troops being called upon to break up the conflict after the Mayor had read the Riot Act. The riot and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town. The town was described as 'Barbarous Basingstoke' by one London newspaper in 1882.|$|E

50|$|After a {{round of}} sackings in November 1971, the workers decided that strike action, common at the site, {{was no longer an}} {{effective}} tactic for confronting management. Drawing inspiration from factory occupations in France since 1968 and actions taken by the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders in Scotland earlier in 1971, the Harco workers adopted <b>the</b> <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work-in.|$|R
50|$|HX 72 {{had lost}} 11 ships of 72,727 gross {{register}} tons, of which Kretschmer sank three and Schepke seven ships.Whilst undoubtedly a victory, and a vindication <b>of</b> Donitz’s wolfpack <b>tactic,</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UBW's successes were achieved {{by two of}} its aces using their high-risk <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> penetrating <b>the</b> convoy to attack from within. The other boats following the more traditional approach from the flank, and at longer range, were far less successful.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, French privateers and naval frigates operating from the fortified island bases of Île de France and Île Bonaparte had attacked British shipping in the Indian Ocean. The huge distances involved, restrictions on supplies and the presence of Royal Navy warships and heavily armed East Indiamen had prevented these relatively weak French ships from attacking the convoys that transported millions of pounds worth of goods from British India and the Far East to the United Kingdom. When one French squadron under Admiral Linois had tried to seize a convoy in 1805, it had been driven off by the aggressive <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merchant captains.|$|E
5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare plagued the city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police department under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing {{the level of violence}} seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Soon after <b>the</b> {{outbreak}} <b>of</b> hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade <b>of</b> Germany. <b>The</b> strategy proved effective, {{cutting off}} vital {{military and civilian}} supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past two centuries. Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships. Since there was limited response to this <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.|$|R

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{opposed by}} the Communist Party USA, with <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comintern's <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Popular Front — mandating efforts by communists {{around the world to}} engage in common efforts with liberals and social democrats against the growing global menace <b>of</b> fascism — <b>the</b> WCF came to be seen as an ideal target for communist participation and control. Executive Secretary Costigan was won over as a secret member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party late in 1936 and communists began dedicated activity in the organization.|$|R
5|$|Horses {{were well}} suited to the warfare <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nomadic {{cultures}} from the steppes of Central Asia. Several East Asian cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. Muslim warriors relied upon light cavalry in their campaigns throughout North Africa, Asia, and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the Middle Ages, and the best-known heavy cavalry warrior of the period was the armoured knight. With {{the decline of the}} knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the Americas. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the Napoleonic wars. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of indigenous people and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, Flags of Our Fathers, {{focused on the}} men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from Iwo Jima, which dealt with the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from Iwo Jima was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from Iwo Jima. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from Iwo Jima won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
5|$|In their mobility, Khalid's {{troops had}} no match until the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. In fact the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert Arabs and steppe Mongols were {{somewhat}} identical. Entire troops of Khalid would ride on camels while on march, whereas the Mongols used horses, with the difference that the Arabs {{did not make}} use of mounted archers. His most commonly used maneuver was surprise attack, such as his night attacks from three different sides on Persian camps at Zumail, Muzayyah and Saniyy, his highly mobile army successfully maneuvering in a 100km area, quickly destroying encampments of the Persians and their Arab allies. The Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj being no exception, where once again his highly mobile army maneuvered around a Byzantine army, appearing from four directions and opening several fronts at a time, a maneuver which later in 13th century {{became one of the}} Mongol armies' principal maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel {{have all}} been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. Further, it has been {{asserted}} that the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounted troops actually helped the enemy withdrawal by concentrating on direct assaults rather than flank attacks. The official British historian acknowledges the disappointment caused by the successful retirement of the German, Austrian and Ottoman force but he also notes {{the quality of the}} successive rearguard positions constructed during the advance, and the strength, determination and endurance of the enemy. The strength of the rearguards was clearly demonstrated at Bir el Abd on 9 August, when the mounted force attempted to outflank the large entrenched force. They failed because they were greatly outnumbered. Indeed, if the Anzac Mounted Division had succeeded in getting round the flank without infantry support, they would have been faced with vastly superior forces and could have been annihilated.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{crossed the}} Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large {{portions}} of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded European Scythia in 513 BC, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, {{where there were no}} cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius {{sent a letter to the}} Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose. Despite the evading <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful. As presented by Herodotus, the tactics used by the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and of damage to their loyal allies. This gave Darius the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians in Eastern Europe proper, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off the land. While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.|$|E
5|$|While the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ranger Company each {{embarked}} for Korea {{shortly after}} their training was complete, the 3rd Ranger Company was retained at Fort Benning, {{to train the}} next cycle of Rangers along with the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Ranger Company. After providing fillers to 1st and 4th companies to cover their training losses, the 3rd had 40 men left. In mid-December, they took an additional 80 men from 7th Company and completed a second cycle of Ranger training. This proved beneficial to the 3rd Company, as it was given cold-weather training alongside the 5th and 8th companies at Fort Carson, Colorado. After the first training cycle was complete; the Ranger units already in Korea had not received this training and were thus unprepared for the Korean winter. The 3rd Company also received additional training which better prepared it for combat, including <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People's Volunteer Army, which the other companies had learned in battle and tracer designation of targets during night attacks. They also received 57mm M18 Recoilless Rifles, however, these were kept on the cargo truck due to the necessity {{to break up a}} rifle team to man a crew-served weapon, which didn't happen. The entire company was trained to be their own forward observers for artillery. In March 1951, the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Companies sailed for Korea, a trip which was fraught with frequent discipline problems as the Rangers continuously got into fights with U.S. Marines on board the troopship while en route. After spending one night in Kobe, Japan, the next morning they sailed for Pusan, South Korea.|$|E
