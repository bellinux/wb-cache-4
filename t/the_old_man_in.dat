5|$|When Catherine {{finds her}} {{colleague}} dead, she flees {{from the company}} premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him. Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed. The Elder finishes his rites and returns home, opening a package delivered from the Middle East; inside is the fragment of the True Cross.|$|E

[...] He is also told that a girl named Phoebe can help him as well.

[...] Phoebe needs the [...] "wakewater," [...] which is said {{to be able to help}} free Aquaria. [...] Benjamin and Phoebe head to the (aptly named) Wintry Cave and defeat a monster to obtain the Libra Crest. [...] Using this crest to enter the Libra Temple, they find that the source of the [...] "wakewater" [...] has dried up. [...] Finding <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the back of the Libra Temple, they find that he holds the only bag (water skin, actually) of wakewater, and to use it on the plant in the center of town. [...] Back in Aquaria, they find that the wakewater doesn't work, and reviving the crystal is the only thing that will save the town and Spencer. [...] They head off for the Ice Pyramid and defeat the second of the Vile Evils, the Ice Golem. [...] The Ice Crystal is saved, and Benjamin and Phoebe head back to Aquaria. [...] They find the town is now like Foresta (after the crystal is revived there) and Spencer is back and digging his tunnel to save Captain Mac (Kaeli's Father). [...] Upon leaving, Spencer hands the Venus Key to Benjamin, and tells him to head for Fireburg.|$|E
