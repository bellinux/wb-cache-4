5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D.

Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help.

When the guardsmen search for <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road.

She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> one being killed and the other shot by his partner.

5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species.

While <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
