2500|$|The engine, {{slightly}} larger than the One-O-Four's, was an inline six of 3.8 litres (3794cc), based on previous Daimler sixes with pushrod operated overhead valves and retaining the [...] stroke, but with the bore increased to [...] from the [...] of the One-O-Four, giving a power output of over [...] at 4,400 rpm and produced [...] of torque at 2,800 rpm.

In order to obtain a pre-dictive model, a discontinuous static friction model is used. The parameters of the suggested model are estimated and the steady-state behaviour of the drill-string system is anal-ysed both numerically and experimentally. A comparison of numerical and experimental bifurcation diagrams indi-cates the predictive quality of the model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method to nonlinearly investigate {{the dynamics of}} the coupled axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> in the circular cross section beam of the steam turbine generator using the FFT analysis. Firstly, the coupled axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> of a beam are proved by equivalent law of shearing stress and different boundary conditions. Then, a nonlinear mathematical model of the coupled axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> is established by the Galerkin method. Lastly, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed to investigate the coupled effect of the beam vibration. A practical calculation example is calculated numerically and the coupled mechanism of the beam’s axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> is analyzed in detail. The analysis results show that the frequencies of the coupled response would be existed in some special orders and the coupled response frequencies are smaller than the single vibration. Since {{for the first time the}} coupled mechanism of the beam’s axial and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> is theoretically analyzed, the findings in this work may provide directive reference for practical engineering problems in design of steam turbine generators. </p...|$|R

Numerical analyses show that two types of <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> can appear: friction-induced <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> and <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> due to the coupling between torsional and lateral dynamics in the system. Moreover, both the numerical and experimental results show that a higher level of mass-unbalance, which generally increases the lateral vibrations, can have a stabilizing effect on the torsional dynamics, i. e. friction-induced limit cycling can disappear. Both types of analysis provide insight in the fundamental mechanisms causing self-sustained oscillations in rotor systems with flexibility, mass-unbalance and discontinuous friction which support the design of such flexible rotor systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a theoretical study of <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> in isotropic elastic plates. The exact solutions for <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> in circular and annular plates are first reviewed. Then, an approximate method is developed to analyze <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> of circular plates with thickness steps. The method {{is based on}} an approximate plate theory for <b>torsional</b> <b>vibrations</b> derived from the variational principle following Mindlin’s series expansion method. Approximate solutions for the zeroth- and first-order torsional modes in the circular plate with one thickness step are presented. It is found that, within a narrow frequency range, the first-order torsional modes can be trapped in the inner region where the thickness exceeds that of the outer region. The mode shapes clearly show that both the displacement and the stress amplitudes decay exponentially away from the thickness step. The existence and the number of the trapped first-order torsional modes in a circular mesa on an infinite plate are determined as functions of the normalized geometric parameters, which may serve as a guide for designing distributed torsionalmode resonators for sensing applications. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements show close agreements in the resonance frequencies of trapped torsional modes. I...|$|R
