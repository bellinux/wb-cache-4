25|$|The wooden lodge where Barentsz' crew {{sheltered}} {{was found}} undisturbed by Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen in 1871. Making {{a sketch of}} the lodge's construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a <b>tool</b> <b>chest,</b> clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod {{and a number of}} pictures. Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a grappling iron, two maps and a handwritten translation of Pet and Jackman's voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, after some had initially been held in The Hague.|$|E

500|$|Samuel {{saved the}} captain's journal, {{commission}} papers and purser's documents, but {{was forced to}} leave behind Bligh's maps and charts—15 years of navigational work. The launch was supplied with about five days' food and water, a sextant, compass and nautical tables, and Purcell's <b>tool</b> <b>chest.</b> At the last minute the mutineers threw four cutlasses down into the boat. Of Bountys complement—44 [...] after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine—19 men [...] were [...] crowded into the launch, leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of freeboard. The 25 men remaining on Bounty included the committed mutineers who had [...] taken up arms, the loyalists detained against their will, and [...] others for whom there was no room in the launch. [...] At around 10:00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut; a little later, Bligh ordered a sail to be raised. Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua, clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was a long}} time, but I had learnt to be patient. I was not unhappy; I {{loved your}} father, I loved the Colonel's little daughter; and I was very fond of you. All these things were small to me in {{comparison}} to my vow and the finding the jewels of the god, but they shortened the years of waiting. Then {{a year before the}} young mistress was eighteen came the shot through the window. I did not know who had fired it, but I saw that your father's life was in danger, and I said to myself, 'He will tell the young sahib what he knows about the bracelet.' After you had gone into the library I opened the door quietly, and listened. I could hear much that was said, but not all. I heard him say something about a snuff box, and some means of finding the lost things being hidden in it, and that he had kept them all these years in a secret hiding place, which he described. You were to search for the diamonds, and I guessed from that {{that he did not know}} what he was to be told when the young memsahib came of age, or perhaps when she was eighteen. It was not until I had thought over what I heard that I came to the conclusion that if I could find the things he spoke of I might be able to find the jewels. By that time your father had gone to bed. I was foolish not to have been patient, but my blood boiled after waiting for eighteen or nineteen years. The god seemed to have sent me the chance, and it seemed to me that I should take it at once. I knew that he generally slept with his window open, and it seemed to me that it would be easy to slip in there and to get those things from the cabinet. I knew where the ladder was kept. I took a file from the <b>tool</b> <b>chest</b> and cut the chain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3 August.--At midnight I went {{to relieve}} {{the man at the}} [...] wheel and when I got to it found no one there. The wind [...] was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I [...] dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few [...] seconds, he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked [...] wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has [...] given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, [...] with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air [...] might hear. [...] "It is here. I know it now. On the watch [...] last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly [...] pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind [...] It, and gave it my knife, but the knife went through It, [...] empty as the air." [...] And as he spoke he took the knife and [...] drove it savagely into space. Then he went on, [...] "But It is [...] here, and I'll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one [...] of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and see. You [...] work the helm." [...] And with a warning look and his finger on [...] his lip, he went below. There was {{springing}} up a choppy [...] wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out [...] on deck again with a <b>tool</b> <b>chest</b> and lantern, and go down [...] the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and [...] it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those big [...] boxes, they are invoiced as clay, and to pull them about is [...] as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay and mind [...] the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God [...] and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can't steer to [...] any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails, [...] and lie by, and signal for help [...] .|$|E

50|$|A tube caddy {{is a type}} of {{carrying}} case used for storing and transporting vacuum tubes. They were carried by repair technicians who performed home service calls in the days when radios and television sets were too large and heavy for the average homeowner to bring to a repair shop. Caddies varied in size and shape, some resembling large briefcases with others resembling <b>tool</b> <b>chests</b> with drawers on the front. Typically they would have rows of square compartments that fit the individually boxed tubes, and often had larger compartments for other components or tools. Most of the space in the caddies was afforded to vacuum tubes (gas-filled tubes were also kept as needed) as most repairs could be effected with the replacement of tubes, with them being some of the few active components in electronic equipment of the time and often being made of glass with sensitive seals they were most likely to break, and were installed in sockets from which they were easy to remove.|$|R
