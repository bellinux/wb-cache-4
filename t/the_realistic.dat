5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Vandersteen {{encountered}} Karel Verschuere, a young unemployed artist. Vandersteen hired him, and Verschuere {{soon became}} his mayor artist for <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> series. His first series was Judi, a retelling of the Old Testament in four albums, which {{first appeared in}} Ons Volkske. The series was not very successful, and Verschuere later finished a fifth part on his own. Verschuere {{also contributed to the}} second part of Tijl Uilenspiegel, just like Bob de Moor and Tibet did, but his main contribution to the output of Vandersteen was his work on Bessy, a Western series inspired by the success of Lassie, which started in 1952 in the Walloon newspaper La Libre Belgique. The series appeared under the pseudonym WiRel, a combination of Willy and Karel, indicating the importance of Verschueren's work. He continued working with Vandersteen until 1967, helping with many of <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> series Vandersteen created in these years, including Karl May, Biggles and especially De Rode Ridder.|$|E

5|$|While doing {{research}} for his decorations, he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life. Fascinated, Vandersteen searched {{for more information}} on the subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième, but also <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But it took a few more years before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E
5|$|Women of the emperor's {{family were}} often {{depicted}} dressed as goddesses or divine personifications such as Pax ("Peace"). Portraiture in painting is represented {{primarily by the}} Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> painting techniques of the Empire. Marble portrait sculpture would have been painted, and while traces of paint have only rarely survived the centuries, the Fayum portraits indicate why ancient literary sources marvelled at how lifelike artistic representations could be.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> {{depiction}} of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate {{the spirit of the}} revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, as suggested by <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{has been}} {{identified}} as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities.

5|$|Sony Pictures Entertainment built {{a promotional}} website, {{releasing}} many previews {{and launched a}} viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox. The film premiered on June 30 in Tokyo, and was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after release of Spider-Man (2002), in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D and released in home media in November 2012. The reboot received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising mostly Andrew Garfield's performance, the visual style, James Horner's musical score, and <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> portrayal of the title character, but {{the introduction of the}} character, the Lizard, was criticized for being too surreal for the film. The film was a box office success, grossing over $757 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2012. The film's sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> representation of subjects as they appeared in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The Quest Begins is {{the first}} novel in the Seekers series. It was written by Erin Hunter, which is a {{pseudonym}} used by authors Cherith Baldry, Kate Cary, Tui Sutherland and editor Victoria Holmes. The novel follows the adventures of four bears, Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and Ujurak. Each bear is stranded by themselves in the wild and must learn to survive. The declining environment of the bears is the main theme conveyed throughout the novel. Like the Warriors series also written by Erin Hunter, Seekers began as a request from HarperCollins who requested another animal story. The company and Victoria Holmes agreed to write about bears after discarding dogs, horses and dolphins. The novel was released in the US on 27 May 2008 and has also been released in the UK, Canada and translated into Russian. Critical reception was positive with reviewers praising <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> behaviour of the bears.|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{he made in}} the Alhambra {{formed a}} major source for his work from that time on. He also studied {{the architecture of the}} Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This {{turned out to be the}} last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|When Frank Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> series of Vandersteen. He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969, when the Bessy-studio took over the job. He also took over Biggles, which ended in 1969, when it was {{replaced}} by the jungle series Safari, inspired by Daktari. At the start of the series, Vandersteen did most of the creative work, but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Film {{director}} Barry Levinson {{sought to}} create a police drama television series based on , a 1991 non-fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to <b>the</b> <b>realistic</b> way Simon portrayed police work and the detectives. The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed the detectives as not always getting along {{with each other and}} told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to the detectives, not personal. Levinson and Tom Fontana, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series St. Elsewhere, hired screenwriter Paul Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E
