40|$|THE EXPRESSION OF REFLEXIVITY IN THE PERICOPES OF JOKŪBAS MORKŪNAS’ POSTIL Summary The article compares {{certain aspects}} of the {{expression}} of reflexivity in <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Morkūnas’ Postil with the equivalents of the Polish original – Rej’s Postil – and Baltramiejus Vilentas’ Gospels and Epistles, used by Morkūnas. The review of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Morkūnas’ text resulted in finding 202 reflexive pronoun structures. In most cases the expression of reflexivity is non-Lithuanian when non-reflexive pronouns are used for the first and second person. About one third of these structures do not coincide with the corresponding structures used by Rej in his Postil, but almost all coincide with the text of Vilentas’ Gospels and Epistles. This confirms earlier statements that Morkūnas took the major­ity of <b>the</b> texts of <b>pericopes</b> from Vilentas. Altogether it should be observed, that the language of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Rej’s Postil in terms of the expression of reflexivity is better than the language of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of <b>the</b> Postil by Morkūnas. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{economy of}} this Midrash {{containing}} sedarim homilies on Deuteronomy, {{as well as}} the character of the individual homilies, could easily have been misconstrued and forgotten after the division of <b>the</b> Torah into <b>pericopes</b> according to <b>the</b> one-year cycle had come into general use.

The sidrot Nitzavim and Vayelech formed one <b>pericope</b> in <b>the</b> oldest Midrash editions (Constantinople, 1512, and Venice, 1545); hence in these editions Debarim Rabbah contains only ten sections, corresponding with <b>the</b> <b>pericopes.</b> <b>The</b> further designation of these sections as [...] "parashiyyot" [...] and their enumeration from 1 to 11, dividing Niẓẓabim and Wayelek, are addenda of the later editions.|$|R

50|$|Form {{criticism}} {{breaks the}} Bible down into sections (pericopes, stories) which are analyzed and categorized by genres (prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament, etc.). The form critic then theorizes on <b>the</b> <b>pericope's</b> Sitz im Leben ("setting in life"), the {{setting in which}} it was composed and, especially, used. Tradition history is a specific aspect of form criticism which aims at tracing the way in which <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> entered <b>the</b> larger units of the biblical canon, and especially {{the way in which they}} made the transition from oral to written form. The belief in the priority, stability, and even detectability, of oral traditions is now recognised to be so deeply questionable as to render tradition history largely useless, but form criticism itself continues to develop as a viable methodology in biblical studies.|$|R
25|$|Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>pericopes</b> "Cursing <b>the</b> Fig Tree", "Cleaning of the Temple" and "The Withered Fig Tree" are {{sometimes}} included among the texts that are labeled as "the difficult Bible pages" or "the {{mysteries of the}} New Testament". About the tenability of this labels give evidence the numerous commentaries of the Gospel according to Mark, which are, mainly {{in the case of}} <b>the</b> first <b>pericope</b> of our interest, ambiguous and which offer several different possibilities of its interpretation. This thesis presents various possibilities of the interpretation of this problematic part of the Gospel according to Mark. In its first chapter the thesis discuss the historical and the literal context of Mark 11 : 12 - 25. In its second chapter the thesis analyses this text and compares it with a similar text from the Gospel according to Mathew (Matthew 21, 10 - 22). In its third chapter the thesis suggests the characteristics of some of the ways of interpretation of Mark 11 : 12 - 25, that are in present times most presented. The goal of the thesis is to present current interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> mentioned above and their comparison and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept of}} righteousness in the Gospel of Matthew. The research explores the literal meanings and theological functions of the noun ’righteousness’ and the adjective ’righteous’ through a descriptive and comparative study of all <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> which include these words. The research also includes relevant information about the historical context of the text {{as well as the}} central theological themes which relate to the subject. In the research on the literal meanings, it seems that both words primarily occur in ethical teaching and that the concept of righteousness in Matthew is closely related to human conduct (e. g. Matt 5 : 20; 6 : 1). This ethic is connected to faithfulness towards the law as interpreted by Jesus. However, there could be aspects of a divine gift by grace in some of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> (Matt 5 : 6; 6 : 33). It is clear that the theological functions of the concept of righteousness are both soteriological and eschatological. This is evident from the different contexts in many of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> which often contain teaching about salvation or are connected to the ’kingdom’. In the final discussion, the focus is placed on a critique of the sharp division between grace and demand which often occurs in commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew. Here I relate my results to the arguments developed by Benno Przybylski. An inclusive and holistic view of righteousness is proposed where grace and demand are intertwined with each other. Finally some further implications for the research are developed where the importance of not reading the gospel of Matthew through the eyes of Paul is highlighted...|$|R

Modern scholars typically view the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer.|$|E
25|$|An 'Old Latin' {{version of}} Tatian's Syriac text {{appears to have}} {{circulated}} in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely {{to that of the}} canonical Gospel of Luke; and also including additional canonical text (such as <b>the</b> <b>pericope</b> of the adulteress), as well, possibly, as non-canonical matter from the Gospel of the Hebrews. With the gradual adoption of the Vulgate as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings. In 546 Victor of Capua discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the Codex Fuldensis, survives in the monastic library at Fulda, where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in Old High German, Eastern Frankish and Old Saxon (the alliterative poem 'Heliand'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th–14th century Gospel harmonies in Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle French, Middle English, Tuscan and Venetian; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The Liège Diatessaron is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced Gospel of Barnabas (Joosten, 2002).|$|E
