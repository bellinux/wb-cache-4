The Automotive Products <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: More than 300 <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have been}} signed since 1950. Two leading {{theoretical}} answers {{to explain the}} phenomenal growth in trade integration and to understand the variation in speed and scope of liberalization {{in the design of}} <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> have emerged. One is that <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> internalize a terms-of-trade externalities (Bagwell and Staiger 1999) : without <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> we would {{live in a world where}} countries beggar their neighbors with high tariffs. The other is that <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> help governments solve their commitment-to-free-trade problems (Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare 2007), which they bring on themselves by acceding to protectionist demands of domestic firms: <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> present an opportunity to governments to break free of these ties and liberalize. Together, the two theories form the basis for a clear political-economy theory of <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> The empirical validity of these explanations has not been tested to date. This paper rigorously tests model-driven hypotheses from both theories. A unique data set on Asian and Latin American <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> is constructed.

This article begins by identifying those <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and other developments including the 2009 Legal Services Initiative of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The article continues by explaining {{the structure of the}} GATS and comparing its provisions to the provisions found in the NAFTA and in other international <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> The article includes several tables that compare the structure and content of the fifteen <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> applicable to legal services.

The"Beyond Market Access"agenda of preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> presents a new and broad set of deep regulatory and policy issues that differs in substance from the removal of tariff and quantitative barriers to trade.

40|$|The recent {{theoretical}} {{literature on}} the determinants of <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> has {{stressed the importance of}} political gains, such as credibility, as a rationale for <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> The empirical literature, however, has lagged behind in the estimation of the economic gains or losses associated with these politically motivated <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> This paper fills that gap by providing estimates of the economic impact of politically and economically motivated <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> We find that credibility gains play a role in increasing the probability of two countries signing an agreement. Moreover, agreements with a stronger political motivation are more <b>trade</b> creating than <b>agreements</b> that are signed for pure market access / economic reasons, and the value for the government of solving its time inconsistency problems through <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> is estimated at an average of 1. 8 % of GDP, which compares quite well with the traditional estimates of the economic gains from trade.

The ICP was even given two ministerships following the establishment of an alliance between the Soviet Union and Iraq. The following year, in 1973, al-Bakr went on a state visit to the Soviet Union, and met Brezhnev personally.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing debate about whether {{bilateral}} <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> are damaging multilateral efforts to eliminate barriers to international trade. This paper develops a model in which trading blocks always charge optimal tariffs and make <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> based on strategic considerations. We ask a very simple question. Does the fact that trading blocks can form bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> make Free <b>trade</b> less likely to occur? The answer is that {{it depends on the}} size distribution of the trading blocks. If there is one large trading block along with some smaller ones then bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> allow the smaller trading blocks to coalesce and block the monopoly power of large trading blocks. In this case, bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> facilitate the attainment of free trade. Not allowing customs unions leads to more not less protection. If trading blocks are of roughly equivalent size then bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> allow groups of trading blocks to more effectively monopolize world trade in which case they may make free trade less likely. These results suggest that a policy which inhibits the formation of trading blocks may be harmful. We also compute the welfare effects of <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> to get some idea of how empirically important these issues are. ...|$|R
