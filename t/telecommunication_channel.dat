40|$|The {{challenge}} {{in the field of}} multimedia telecommunications is an attempt to integrate texts, sound, images and videos coherently and consistently and to ensure simplicity and interactivity of operation. In order to make the proposed multimedia applications acceptable to end-users, the quality of transmission through the network and message presentation should have special attention. The main aims of this paper are the introduction to the communication channel with its basic elements, {{a detailed description of the}} information source and the presentation of possible approaches to the analysis of the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel.</b> Introduction In the age of mass application of various communication means, end-users of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel</b> elements rarely pay attention to the processes taking place in everyday communication and the elements presented in the channel. In order to discuss all the factors that influence the establishment and maintenance of the links, this paper will explain the basic elements of telecommunication channels. Source Every object that generates messages to be transferred to a recipient is called the source of the message. Directors, writers, speakers, books, newspapers, various instruments (thermometer, barometer, ammeter, etc.), computers, a man himself - these are all sources of various messages. In relation to facilities that generate messages, there are different sources of messages. All the messages that they generate belong to discrete or continuous modes of messages. Discrete messages can be presented with element sets, where elements can be considered through different values of observed messages. Each text message of arbitrary length, for example, is made of a finite number of elements - symbols (letters, numbers, punctuation marks), from the set of symbols called the alphabet message source. Continuous messages can be presented with an infinite number of sets of elements where elements can have different values of the observed messages. Coder of messages generated by a message source should be transmitted to the recipient. For that purpose, an appropriate communication channel is used, with appropriate electrical signals as material bearers of the message. Definition of the code and the code system The set of combinations of digits that mirrors the elements of the set A is called a code. The established rule considers situations when each symbol from the set A is associated with the combination of elements of the set B. The function f defining this translation must be defined. This replacement is called a code replacement. Signal coder A coder performs signal transformation of coded messages to an electrical signal adapted for transmission via the transmission system. The most common signals are voltage transmission via cable connection or an electromagnetic field in the radio transmission. Modern systems for transferring discrete messages contain codecs and modems. Portable system A portable system is the medium for signal transmission from the source to the point of receipt. It can be wired and wireless. A wired transmission system is used in the stationary elements of communication systems. Wireless signal transmission is used in all conditions and it is more rational, efficient and economical. On their way through the transmission system, signals are subject to a variety of interferences. For a better insight into the interference impact, the source of interference is added to the whole system. Conclusion The model of the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel</b> is a complex system of a series of mutually dependent elements. Effectiveness of these elements is evaluated by the performances of the probability that the transfer of information through the channel will be successful. In a thus modeled <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel,</b> regardless of the technical means used which is either a system or a circuit, the place and role of each element can be considered, which is the basis for consideration of possible approaches to the protection of information in the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel...</b>|$|E

That is, manipulating more effectively information security among end-users. Achieving the required level of information security within organizations usually requires security awareness and control but also a better understanding of end-user behavior in which security measures are tailored, too.

Our i-vector experiments on different sub-bands with 782 speakers show that standard landline codecs perform generally better than wireless codecs due to their intrinsic coding algorithm, their performance being close to, but slightly worse than that of uncoded speech. Wideband signals offer significant benefits over narrowband for speaker verification.

Quantum cryptography provides a unique means to establish, at remote locations, identical strings of genuine random bits, {{with a level}} of secrecy unattainable using classical resources.

40|$|Advances in CMOS {{technology}} {{have resulted in}} increased clock fre-quencies, even exceeding 3 GHz. At the same time, frequencies on most board wires are 125 - 800 MHz. It is especially problematic in modern computer mem-ory buses and high speed telecommunication devices, such as switches and routers operating at 10 Gb/s on its ports. It is believed that circuit board buses can be used up to about 20 GHz, {{but there is a}} problem with Intersymbol Inter-ference (ISI) causing distortion of transmitted symbols by multiple reflections. Actually, the circuit board bus behaves like a passive low pass filter with unknown (perhaps changing) transfer characteristic. The problem of ISI was solved some time ago in the telecommunication area. With use of adaptive equalizers it is possible to increase throughput of a long distance communication channel dramatically. But the microprocessor bus has certain differences from telecommunica-tion devices such as modems. First of all, the clock frequency on a bus is much higher than in modems. Secondly, a bus has a much more complex structure than a <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel.</b> At the same time, we can’t use a lot of re-sources for bus maintaining.

40|$|This work investigates how channel {{parameter}} estimation errors affect {{the performance of}} telecommunication systems. The <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel</b> is (usually) modeled as a linear filter which is comprised of a fixed number of coefficients. In this sense, the term “{{channel parameter}}s” is used to denote either {{the total number of}} these coefficients or the exact value of each one of them. Numerous algorithms/procedures in the telecommunication literature assume exact knowledge of these parameters and subsequently build upon this knowledge to carry out a specific telecommunication task. In real world conditions, however, nothing is known a priori and all such quantities must be estimated by means of a suitable procedure. Nevertheless, any estimation procedure is subject to errors, which can cause severe degradation of the overall system performance. The present study unfolds along two main axes: The performance analysis (in terms of equalization quality) of a blind second order statistics (SOS) equalization algorithm when channel order (i. e. number of channel coefficients) is unknown and the performance analysis (in terms of sum-rate degradation) of the uplink of a multiuser multiantenna system, when the exact values of channel coefficients for each user are unknown. Using rigorous mathematical analysis based on perturbation theory results together with simulation evidence, conditions and conclusions are derived as to the instances where estimation errors lead (or do not lead) to a significant system performance deterioration. ...|$|E

It has been defined that enhancing noise resistance in digital <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channels</b> is achieved by using schemes of cascade turbo-encoding. The slope of TC characteristics is defined to lower at growing value of Eb / N 0, what testifies of saturation effect in error probability. From the research {{it has been found}} that encoding energy benefit (EEB) for cascade code is formed by the structure: outer Reed-Solomon encoder, inner –turbo-encoder makes about 1. 8 dB for level BER 10 E- 6 as compared with cascade code CC: RS (255, 223), CnC (171, 133), BPSK, R= 1 / 2. The structural scheme of data transmission channel with cascade turbo-encoding has been developed. It is defined that in case of encoding rate ½ EEB= 2. 3 dB (BER= 10 E- 5) as compared with cascade code having the following structure: SCS RS (255, 247), interleaver, CnC (171, 133), QPSK, R = 1 / 2. In case of realizing data transmission channel at encoding rate 1 / 3 - EEB equaled 2. 8 dB (BER= 10 E- 5), as compared with cascade code having structure: SCS RS (255, 247), interleaver, CnC (171, 133), QPSK, R = 1 / 2.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the characterization, {{modeling}} and calibration of pipeline analog-digital converters (ADC) s. The integral nonlinearity (INL) is characterized, modeled and the model is used to design a post-correction block in order to compensate the imperfections of the ADC. The INL model is divided into: a dynamic term designed by the low code frequency (LCF) component depending on the output code k and the frequency under test m, and a static term known as high code frequency (HCF) component depending solely on the output code k. The HCF {{is related to the}} pipeline ADC circuitry. A set of adjacent piecewise linear segments is used to model the HCF. The LCF is the dynamic term depending on the input signal characteristics, and is modeled using a polynomial with frequency dependent coefficients. Two dynamic calibration methodologies are developed to compensate the imperfections of the pipeline ADC. In the first approach, the INL model at hand is transformed into a post-correction scheme. Regarding the HCF model, a set of gains and offsets is used to reconstruct the HCF segments structure. The LCF polynomial frequency dependent coefficients are used to design a bank of FIR filters which reconstructs the LCF model. A calibration block made by the combination of static gains/offsets and a bank of FIR filters is built to create the correction term to calibrate the ADC. In the second approach, the calibration (and modeling) process is extended to the upper Nyquist bands of the ADC. The HCF is used directly in calibration as a look-up-table (LUT). The LCF part is still represented by a frequency dependent polynomial of which the coefficients are used to develop a filter bank, implemented in the frequency domain with an overlap-and-add structure. In brief the calibration process is done by the combination of a static LUT and a bank of frequency domain filters. The maximum likelihood (ML) method is used to estimate the K-factor of a wireless Ricean channel. The K-factor {{is one of the main}} characteristics of a <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channel.</b> However, a closed-form ML estimator of the Kfactor is unfeasible due to the complexity of the Ricean pdf. In order to overcome this limitation, an approximation (for high K-factor values) is induced to the Ricean pdf. A closed-form approximate ML (AML) for the Ricean K-factor is computed. A bias study is performed on the AML and the bias derived value is used to improve the AML estimation, leading to a closed-form bias compensated estimator (BCE). The BCE performance (in terms of variance, bias and mean square error (MSE)) is simulated and compared to the best known closed-form moment-based estimator found in the literature. The BCE turns to have a superior performance for low number of samples and/or high K-factor values. Finally, the BCE is applied on real site wireless channel measurements in an urban macro cell area, using a 4 -antenna transmit/receive MIMO system. QC 2012052...|$|E

The problem carries a greater signif-icance in applications over <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channels,</b> es-pecially with the wider use of personal communications sys-tems such as cellular phones which invariably present chal-lenging acoustical conditions. In this work, we introduce a vector quantization (VQ) based compensation technique which both makes use of a priori information about likely acoustical environments and adapts to the test environment to improve recognition. The technique is progressive and requires neither simultaneously recorded speech from the training and the testing environments nor EM-type batch iterations. Instead of using simultaneously recorded data, the integrity of the updated VQ codebooks with respect to acoustical classes is maintained by endowing the codebooks with a topology and using transformations which preserve the topology of the reference environment.

These systems are expected {{to play a major}} role within future fifth generation wireless networks due to their inherent capillary distribution properties. Nonlinear compensation techniques are becoming increasingly important to improve the performance of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>channels</b> by compensating for channel nonlinearities. Indeed, significant bounds on the technology usability and performance degradation occur due to nonlinear characteristics of optical transmitter, nonlinear generation of spurious frequencies, which, in the case of RoF links exploiting Directly Modulated Lasers, has the combined effect of laser chirp and optical fiber dispersion among its prevailing causes. The purpose of the research is to analyze some of the main causes of harmonic and intermodulation distortion present in Radio over Fiber (RoF) links, and to suggest a solution to reduce their effects, through a digital predistortion technique. Predistortion is an effective and interesting solution to linearize and this allows to demonstrate that the laser’s chirp and the optical fiber’s dispersion are the main causes which generate harmonic distortion. The improvements illustrated are only theoretical, based on a feasibility point of view. The simulations performed lead to significant improvements for short and long distances of radio over fiber link lengths. The algorithm utilized for simulation has been implemented on MATLAB. The effects of chirp and fiber nonlinearity in a directly modulated fiber transmission system are investigated by simulation, and a cost effective and rather simple technique for compensating these effects is discussed. A detailed description of its functional model is given, and its attractive features both in terms of quality improvement of the received signal, and cost effectiveness of the system are illustrated...|$|R
