Starting at a hand gallop, {{for the first three}} hundred yards he rode straight {{at the tip of the}} tongue-shaped mass of cavalry which, numbering, so far as I could judge, about eight thousand sabres, was advancing to charge us. Then he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace, and I saw the great wedge curl round, and before the foe could check himself and turn to meet it, strike him about halfway down his length, with a crashing rending sound, like that of the breaking-up of vast sheets of ice. In sank the great wedge, into his heart, and as it cut its way hundreds of horsemen were thrown up on either side of it, just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshare, or more like still, as the foaming water curls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship. In, yet in, vainly does the <b>tongue</b> <b>twist</b> its ends round in agony, like an injured snake, and strive to protect its centre; still farther in, by Heaven! right through, and so, amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands, back again upon the severed ends, beating them down, driving them as a gale drives spray, till at last, amidst the rushing of hundreds of riderless horses, the flashing of swords, and the victorious clamour of their pursuers, the great force crumples up like an empty glove, then turns and gallops pell-mell for safety back to its own lines.|$|E

Well, miss, this morning I got up quite early, and unscrewed the dogs' tongues, and looked in the places they had come out of, but could not see anything. Then I pushed the sharp end of the tongue into the hole, and twisted and poked about, but I could not find anything moved; then I put that tongue in again, and tried the other, and directly I pushed the sharp end in, I felt something give way, and then I heard a click. I jumped up and pushed the knob in the chimney, and directly something creaked, and the whole of the left hand side of the fireplace swung open like a low door, about four feet high, and beyond it was a little flight of stone stairs. I was so excited, sir, when I saw the door and the steps, and knew I had found the place I had been looking for so long, that I had to lean against the wall to support myself. After a little while I pushed the door back again, and heard it close with a click.

50|$|In 1795, Himamaylan {{became the}} capital of Negros. At that time, the city served as a {{garrison}} for occupying Spanish forces. Today, the old Spanish-built fort constructed as a lookout point for frequent Muslim raids {{is one of the}} historical attractions found in the city.In the middle part of 1565, the Spaniards came and subjugated Himamaylan. They introduced Encomienda System by which a piece of land including its products and other resources, and its inhabitants were granted to members of the conquering force as their puppets. The first Spanish priest, constructed a makeshift church and gathered the native which they later called “Himaya”, a thanksgiving for driving the “Hima” away. Himaya was also a place for spiritual paradise to the Babaylan. They later called “Himaya” as Himamaya-an or Himamaylan, but because of the <b>tongue</b> <b>twisting</b> sound of its syllables which the priest find difficulty in pronouncing, they changed the word to Himamaylan to suit their diction. The name Himamaylan was adopted officially when the place was founded into a township or pueblo. Thus, the town got its name both from historical and dialectical origin. Himamaylan was founded in the 18th century. Although there was no definite record found, it became the second capital of Negros Island from 1795-1849; first being Municipality of Ilog. The town’s historical landmark, the Spanish Kota (Fortress) was the seat of the Old Spanish Government. It was also the place where many natives were cured of their sickness and consequently converted to Christianity. Himamaylan’s historical records showed that in 1565 when the Spaniards came, there spur a quantum jump in the people’s religious life. From a pagan life, fresh arterial blood pumped into the multiplying discipline. In a span of only a few years after Spanish Colonization, embracing the Catholic Faith, the dame dramatic transformation continued to happen that even intellectuals of today is mystified in their own findings and misbelief that they were naturally drawn to the faith. On November 4, 1898, the revolutionary forces in Himamaylan received orders from Gen. Juan Araneta to dislodge the Spanish Soldiers stationed in the town on November 5, {{and the rest of the}} towns in Negros. Due to lack of weapons they were not able to carry out the order and it was only on 8 November 1898 when the Deputy Commander for Southern Negros in the person of Gen. Rafael Ramos showed the Spanish Corporal a copy of the Act of Capitulation, that the Spanish Soldiers surrendered, thus, making Himamaylan as the last town to have been liberated from the Spanish Government. When the Americans came on December 28, 1898, they easily capitulated the island of Negros from the Spanish Colonizers, thereby establishing the American Rule in the whole island. In the year 1942, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor to the Japanese forces, three days after Negros Occidental also fall, thus, the Japanese Military Government was established in the whole province. The guerrilla resistance fighters and local soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units was encounter siege around the municipality of Himamaylan was attacking Japanese soldiers from 1942 to 1945 until the retreating guerrillas by the Japanese. On 1945, Filipino and American soldiers aiding recognized guerrillas liberated the municipality of Himamaylan and defeating Japanese forces and ended in World War II.|$|R
