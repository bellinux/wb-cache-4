25|$|A team {{time trial}} (TTT) is {{a race against}} the clock in which each team rides alone. The <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the fifth rider of each team: riders more than a bike-length behind their team's fifth rider are awarded their own times. The TTT has been criticised for favouring strong teams and handicapping strong riders in weak teams. The prologue stage in 1971 was a team time trial.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, Latvian {{linguists}} Kārlis Mīlenbahs and Jānis Endzelīns elaborated {{the modern}} Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another {{feature of the}} language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian. Even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet, this process takes place. Moreover, the names are modified {{in order to ensure}} that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija. This is a good example of linguistic purism in this language.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance measures}} change over time. A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; return on equity in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E

25|$|Before moving {{onto the}} second scene the {{audience}} is treated {{to some of the}} footage edited on the big screen. This short clip features some pre-filmed shots with those that include the volunteers. The second scene begins with the rally car racing in from the left hand side and performing a 360 turn. This is followed by the two police cars who race in moments later. The three cars exit from the far right and return {{in the middle of the}} arena. The rally car then skids 180 and stops while the two police cars circle it. It then proceeds to reverse out of the arena. Upon returning, the car begins to perform a variety of figure 8 near-misses with the two police cars in reverse. Unknown to the audience at the <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the car is reversed out of the scene, it is swapped for a specifically designed, reverse car. The car is then swapped back to the forwards driving car in a similar style. At this point all three cars drive along a two-wheel kicker ramp, which allows the cars to drive on two wheels. All three cars drive in a figure 8 motion around the arena on two wheels before returning to all four at the same moment. The scene ends with the return of the motorcyclist who rides through a wall of fire before being stopped by the police.|$|E

500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though {{you can hear it}} in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I took a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path.

While she granted that they “offer nice arch support,” she added that the real reason you shouldn’t wear them {{over long periods of}} <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> “these shoes do not adequately secure the heel.

2500|$|Until the {{discovery}} of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time and motion are relative, not absolute: [...] "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as <b>time</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> I hold {{it to be an}} order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, [...] "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" [...] ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche {{rejects the}} idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call [...] "truth" [...] is only [...] "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." [...] His view at this <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; [...] "truth" [...] {{is nothing more than}} the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence.|$|E

2500|$|Chamberlain was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Hanns Hörbiger's Welteislehre, the theory that most bodies {{in our solar system}} are covered with ice. Due in part to Chamberlain's advocacy, this became official cosmological dogma during the Third Reich. Chamberlain's attitude towards the natural sciences was somewhat ambivalent and contradictory – he later wrote: [...] "one of the most fatal errors of our <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which impels us to give too great weight to the so-called 'results' of science." [...] Still, his scientific credentials were often cited by admirers to give weight to his political philosophy.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and important 'concepts' in Being and <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Das Man, {{for which there is no}} exact English translation; different translations and commentators use different conventions. It is often translated as [...] "the They" [...] or [...] "People" [...] or [...] "Anyone" [...] but is more accurately translated as [...] "One" [...] (as in [...] "'one' should always arrive on time"). Das Man derives from the impersonal singular pronoun man ('one', as distinct from 'I', or 'you', or 'he', or 'she', or 'they'). Both the German man and the English 'one' are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word man in German is nearly identical to that of the word one in English.|$|E
2500|$|A team {{time trial}} (TTT) is {{a race against}} the clock in which each team rides alone. The order for the team time trial is {{determined}} by the inversed order of the team classification, except for the race leader's team who is always the last to start. The teams' start times are staggered by five minutes. The riders work together in the team time trial by taking turns at the front, to lift the pace and break the wind for their teammates to save them energy. [...] The <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the fifth rider of each team: riders more than a bike-length behind their team's fifth rider were awarded their own times.

2500|$|By 1620, the Mayflower was aging, {{nearing the}} end of the usual working life of an English {{merchant}} ship in that era, some 15 years. No dimensions of her hull can be stated exactly, since this was many years before such measurements were standardized. She probably measured about 100 feet (30 m) in length from the forward end at the beak of her prow to the tip of her stern superstructure aft. She was about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point, with the bottom of her keel about 12 feet (3.6 m) below the waterline. Although William Bradford [...] was not a mariner, he estimated that Mayflower had a cargo capacity of 180 tons. [...] What is known on the basis of surviving records from that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she could certainly accommodate 180 casks of wine in her cargo hold. The casks were great barrels that each held hundreds of gallons of claret wine.|$|E
2500|$|Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar {{writes that}} [...] "The Satavahana sculptures {{unfortunately}} {{has never been}} recognized as an independent school {{in spite of the}} fact it has its own distinctive characteristic features.

It is profusely decorated with carvings, and even pillars have a lotus capital crowned with sphinx-like mythic animals." [...] Dhavalikar also writes that in Chankama [...] "the panel occurring on the west pillar of Northern Gateway portrays a very important event in Buddha's life. It depicts votaries, two each on either side of what looks like a ladder which actually is the promenade which Buddha is supposed to have walked. It is said that Buddha, after attaining Enlightment, spent four weeks near the Bodhi tree. Of these, the third week he spent walking along the promenade (chankama) to and fro." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E
