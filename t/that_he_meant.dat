25|$|On 11 December, Ardzinba {{declared}} {{that while the}} power-sharing agreement that resolved the 2004 post-election crisis had meant {{to bring an end}} to the division in the Abkhazian society, it had in fact failed to do so, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to correct that. Ardzinba also spoke out against the size of the bureaucracy, lamenting the duplication of functions.|$|E
25|$|Ibn al-Nadim once {{mentioned}} {{a book called}} Ardashir's Testament that Al-Baladhuri (died 279 Hijri), one of Persian (Middle) translators, had turned into an Arabic poem. Once again in the chapter about the books of the Persians, Romans, Indians and Arabs in the preaches and ethics and doctrines, he {{mentioned a}} book called Ardashir I's Testament to His Son Shapur and it seems <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> another book.|$|E
25|$|Since his {{election}} in 1968, President Richard M. Nixon had been seeking {{a negotiated settlement}} to the Vietnam War. In 1970, he saw an opportunity to buy time for the Saigon government during Vietnamization, the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops {{that began in the}} previous year. He also sought to convince Hanoi <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> business. That opportunity was provided by the overthrow of Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk by the pro-American General Lon Nol.|$|E

25|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} Rahab {{was one of}} the four most {{beautiful}} women who ever lived, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. The Rabbis taught that Rahab inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. Rabbi Isaac taught that saying Rahab's name twice would cause a man immediately to lose control. Rav Nachman protested that he said Rahab's name twice and nothing happened to him. Rabbi Isaac replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that this would happen to any man who knew her.|$|E
25|$|The media's main {{criticism}} of Reagan centered on his gaffes. When Carter kicked-off his general election campaign in Tuscumbia, Reagan—referring to the Southern US as a whole—claimed that Carter had begun his {{campaign in the}} birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. In doing so, Reagan seemed to insinuate that the KKK represented the South, which caused many Southern governors to denounce Reagan's remarks. Additionally, Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats for saying that trees caused pollution; he later said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted.|$|E
500|$|Lansford Hastings {{received}} death threats. An emigrant {{who crossed}} before the Donner Party confronted Hastings {{about the difficulties}} they had encountered, reporting: [...] "Of course he could say nothing {{but that he was}} very sorry, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> well".|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Watership Down contains symbolism of several religions, or that the stories of El-ahrairah were meant to mimic some elements of real-world religion. When asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams stated that the story was [...] "nothing like that at all." [...] Adams said that the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship, however, [...] "they believed passionately in El-ahrairah". Adams explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> the book to be, [...] "only a made-up story... in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls". Instead, he explained, the [...] "let-in" [...] religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and that these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often [...] "grim" [...] tales of the [...] "real story".|$|E
500|$|Three days later, Costa was {{involved}} in controversy in a 2–0 home win over Arsenal; he repeatedly slapped Laurent Koscielny and chest-bumped him to the ground, and then confronted Gabriel, who allegedly tried to kick him and was sent off, though footage from ESPN Brazil later showed that little to no contact actually took place. He escaped any punishment at the time. His conduct was deemed [...] "disgusting" [...] by visiting manager Arsène Wenger, and teammate Kurt Zouma initially reacted by saying, [...] "Diego likes to cheat a lot," [...] but later clarified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that [...] "Diego is a player who puts pressure on his opponents". As a consequence, on 21 September, {{he was charged with}} violent conduct by the FA. and the following day he was given a three-match suspension. Gabriel's red card was also rescinded, although he was given a one-match ban and £10,000 fine for improper conduct after failing to leave the pitch immediately. After this incident, the Daily Express wrote that Costa was [...] "named as [...] Premier League's dirtiest player".|$|E
500|$|Speaking for the government, Edward Coke {{accused him}} of {{involvement}} in every treason since 1586, the year he returned to England. [...] According to Coke, the provincial superior {{was involved in the}} Main and Bye Plots of 1603. [...] He had sent Edmund Baynham to Rome to gain papal approval for the 1605 plot, and while at Coughton in November, had prayed [...] "for the success of the great action". Coke called Garnet [...] "a doctor of five Ds, namely, of dissimulation, of deposing of princes, of disposing of kingdoms, of daunting and deterring of subjects, and of destruction". His supposed inappropriate relationship with Anne Vaux was mentioned, but his adherence to the doctrine of equivocation proved extremely damaging. Francis Tresham's deathbed letter, which claimed that Garnet had played no part in the so-called Spanish Treason, was read aloud. [...] Tresham claimed not to have seen Garnet [...] "for fifteen or sixteen years before", despite government evidence that the two had met more recently. Garnet had not seen the letter and did not know that it referred to events before 1602, not 1605. He was unable to explain it, except by saying [...] "it may be, my Lord, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to equivocate." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{in series}} ten, Joseph's brother's {{condition}} deteriorates {{and he is}} admitted to Holby City Hospital in need of an operation. [...] Faye supports Joseph, and the two kiss. Joseph's hopes are raised when his brother opens his eyes, and he considers expensive neurology treatment in America to try and rouse Harry from his coma. Shortly thereafter, however, Harry's condition worsens again, and Joseph and his mother allow Harry to die. Following his brother's death, Joseph returns to work to find Jac on trial for Sam's old position. This reignites their feud, and Joseph is unable to block Jac from gaining the position. His relationship with Faye develops slowly, however Joseph's suspicions are raised when she lies to him about her whereabouts on several occasions, leading to the eventual discovery that the police suspect her {{of the murder of}} her second husband, Donald. An exhumation reveals that Donald did not die of cancer, as Faye insisted, but of arsenic poisoning. Joseph remains suspicious, but supports Faye as their relationship continues to develop. When Faye has a pregnancy scare, he proposes to her, and insists <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> it even after the discovery she is not actually pregnant. Joseph is devastated when Faye appears to have stolen £5,000 from him and left the country, but discovers she is in fact in trouble in South Africa. After flying out with colleague Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow), Faye reveals she has a ten-year-old son, Archie, who lives in a care home because of a genetic disease. Joseph saves Archie's life in a risky operation, and he and Faye return from South Africa engaged once more, much to Jac's chagrin.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "shoah" [...] in Hebrew means [...] "disaster"; but Ha-Shoah (The Holocaust) is {{primarily}} used in Israel {{to refer to}} the Holocaust. As a result, the wire service put out a story [...] "Israel minister warns Palestinians of 'Holocaust'", provoking a controversy. Vilnai's spokesman later insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> only meant [...] "disaster, ruin or destruction" [...] and not [...] "genocide".|$|E

2500|$|Nakasone aroused {{controversy}} in September 1986 when {{he claimed that}} Americans were on average less intelligent than Japanese because [...] "the US has many immigrants, Puerto Ricans and blacks, who bring the average level down". He then clarified his comments, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to congratulate the US on its economic success {{despite the presence of}} [...] "problematic" [...] minorities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} and {{subsequent}} editions Malthus put more emphasis on moral restraint. By <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> the postponement of marriage until people could support a family, coupled with strict celibacy (sexual abstinence) until that time. [...] "He {{went so far as}} to claim that moral restraint on a wide scale was the best means—indeed, the only means—of easing the poverty of the lower classes." [...] This plan appeared consistent with virtue, economic gain and social improvement.|$|E
2500|$|After Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he {{nominated}} Haig {{to be his}} Secretary of State. After {{the attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan, Haig asserted [...] "I am in control here," [...] later stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that he was functionally {{in control of the}} government. During the Falklands War, Haig sought to broker peace between the United Kingdom and Argentina. He resigned from Reagan's cabinet in July 1982. After leaving office, he unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination in the 1988 Republican primaries. He also served as the head of a consulting firm and hosted the television program World Business Review.|$|E

2500|$|Whatever {{its size}} and quality, {{near the end of}} the war Hitler wanted it {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> the collection to be for the public [...] even though there were hundreds of artworks that were specifically marked for use in the Berghof, his mountain retreat, and for a castle in Posen which Hitler intended as another residence. Still, in the [...] "Private Testament" [...] he drew up the day before his death, he specified that the collection should go to the museum when it was built, writing that they were [...] "never collected for private purposes, but always only for the expansion of a gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube." ...|$|E

I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that {{the truth of what}} rings through all his writing is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> what he said. If that is {{entertainment}} to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to— and go there. He could never stand being bored. But there must be Football too— and Peacocks..." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Corrill {{recalled}} that [...] "the first presidency {{did not seem}} to {{have much to do with}} [...] at first", and some of the Danites clearly saw this sermon as a sign of approval. The matter was tabled until the following Sunday (June 17, 1838) when Sidney Rigdon preached his Salt Sermon, in which he likened the dissenters to [...] "salt that had lost its savor." [...] He went on to state that the dissenters would be [...] "trodden under the foot of men." [...] Corrill stated that [...] "although [...] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> the dissenters or those who had denied the faith." [...] Rigdon's strongly worded sermon may have played a significant role in encouraging the dissenters to leave the county.|$|E
