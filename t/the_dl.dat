5|$|Hanigan {{spent the}} entire 2009 season with the Reds except for five games with the Bats. He served as the backup catcher to Ramón Hernández until Hernández {{underwent}} knee surgery and was placed on <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> Hanigan went on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> after he was hit on the face mask by a foul tip and suffered a concussion; he returned on August 8, 2009. For the season, Hanigan had the best fielding percentage as a catcher (.998), and the second best caught stealing percentage (42.9) in the majors.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the disabled list on July 8, after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired shoulder. He returned from <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> again on July 21 against the Washington Nationals, and was 3 for 4 with a home run and a double in the game.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{strained}} {{an oblique}} muscle in 2011 spring training {{and opened the}} season on <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> He was activated from <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA {{in his first two}} games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was placed}} on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> on August 21 due to {{inflammation}} in his right elbow. At {{the time of his}} injury, he was third in the NL in saves, behind Craig Kimbrel and John Axford. On September 18, the Giants reactivated him from <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> After two games back, Bochy decided to shut down Wilson for the final two games of the season. In 57 games, he had a 6–4 record, a 3.11 ERA, 54 strikeouts, and 31 walks in 55 innings pitched. He converted 36 of his 41 save opportunities, which tied Juan Carlos Oviedo for eighth in the NL.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after only four games with blister problems again. His time on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> was brief and he returned to the Royals on May 6. On May 28, he struck out a career high eight hitters in a win against the Minnesota Twins. Later, on June 6, he notched his first hit.|$|E

He made his first appearance since returning from <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> on August 22, {{but he did not}} get another save until September 1 in a 10 victory over the Tigers. He picked up four more saves to finish the year with a careerhigh 13 saves and a 4.95 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E
5|$|Lieber began 2007 on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> with a {{strained}} right oblique, {{and when he}} was activated on April 9, he was placed in the bullpen. After two relief outings, he returned to the rotation on April 20 when Brett Myers was moved to the bullpen. On June 9, he struck out 11 and allowed three hits in a 40 shutout of the Royals. At the time, he was 34 with a 3.72 ERA, but he allowed 14 runs (13 earned) over his next two starts, both losses. On June 23, Lieber was placed on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> with a ruptured tendon in his right foot, which ended his tenure with the Phillies. In 14 games (12 starts), he had a 36 record, a 4.73 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 91 hits allowed in 78 innings. The Phillies reached the playoffs, but Lieber was left off their postseason roster because of his injury.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the concept product as an expressive feature for description logics (DLs).

5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 athletes on the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers tried to hold on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low throw from Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed on <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{spent the}} entire 2003 {{campaign}} with the Indians. Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring and missing the final six {{weeks of the season}} with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, while on <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He pleaded not guilty to speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the MLB club on August 8 to replace Schiraldi, but was demoted on August 13 before making an appearance, as Chicago activated Les Lancaster from <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> Capel rejoined the club on August 31, and pitched in five more games before the season's end. Over his first MLB season, Capel pitched in 20 games and allowed 16 earned runs over 29.1 innings for a 4.91 ERA. He pitched the entire 1989 season for Iowa, appearing in 64 games for the team. On October 15, Capel was granted free agency by the Cubs; he signed with the Brewers two months later.|$|E
50|$|On April 15 the Rangers and pitcher Matt Harrison would tie the MLB {{record by}} turning 6 double {{plays in the}} game.

5|$|Lieber's 2002 {{season was}} curtailed by right elbow problems, which plagued him all year. On August 1, facing the San Diego Padres, Lieber allowed two runs in seven innings but {{received}} a no-decision in an 87 Cubs' victory. He {{was placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> with right elbow tendinitis the next day, and he underwent Tommy John surgery on August 8, ending his season. In 21 starts, Lieber compiled a 68 record, a 3.70 ERA, 87 strikeouts, 12 walks, and 153 hits allowed in 141 innings pitched. He still managed to tie Randy Wolf, Brett Tomko, Pedro Astacio, and teammate Matt Clement for tenth in the league with three complete games. After the season, he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Lieber was the Pirates' fourth starter. He had a 510 record {{over his}} first 17 starts, {{partly because he}} {{received}} 15 total runs of support in the losses over that time. Lieber had an 813 record with a 3.90 ERA before getting placed {{on the disabled list}} (DL) {{for the first time in}} his career on August 21 due to a left oblique muscle strain. He returned from <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> on September 15 but posted a 10.80 ERA over his last two starts. In 29 games (28 starts), Lieber posted an 814 record, a 4.11 ERA, 138 strikeouts, 40 walks, and 182 hits allowed in 171 innings pitched. He was tied with seven other pitchers for fifth in the league in losses. Following the season, Lieber was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Brant Brown.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to <b>the</b> <b>DL.</b> Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one home run in the Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about two months with his hamstring injury.|$|E

By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to <b>the</b> <b>DL</b> grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
