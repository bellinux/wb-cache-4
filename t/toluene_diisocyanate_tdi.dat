Capsaicin (0. 03 mM) produced shortening in 15 (35 +/- 6. 6 %) and relaxation in 11 preparations (41 +/- 6. 8 %), whereas a second administration caused shortening in nine (25. 1 +/- 6. 1 %) and relaxation in 16 rings (36. 4 +/- 4. 9 %). When <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> was given after two consecutive capsaicin administrations, we observed shortening in two rings (10. 0 +/- 3. 6 %), relaxation in ten rings (15. 9 +/- 3. 6 %), and no response in four preparations.

50|$|The {{aromatic}} polyurethane and urea type crosslinker {{is one of}} {{the significant}} reasons why many cathodic electrocoats show high levels of protection against corrosion. Of course {{it is not the only}} reason, but if one compares electrocoating compositions with aromatic urethane crosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better. However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance. If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur. A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers. A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines. Urethane crosslinkers based on <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>TDI)</b> can be expected to produce toluene diamine as a side reaction, whereas those based on Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate produce diaminodiphenylmethane and higher order aromatic polyamines. The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight. Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.|$|E

METHODS: The study was designed to assess the effect of two {{loop diuretic}}s, bumetanide (10 and 100 microM) and frusemide (100 microM), on smooth muscle contraction induced by <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (0. 03 - 1000 microM) in guinea pig airways with and, in the case of bumetanide, without epithelium. The effect of bumetanide on the response to acetylcholine, neurokinin A, and electrical field stimulation in guinea pig bronchial smooth muscle rings was also examined. RESULTS: Bumetanide (10 and 100 microM) had no effect on <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> induced contraction whether airway epithelium was present or not. Frusemide (100 microM) caused no significant inhibition of <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> induced contraction (mean reduction on the entire curve 25 %). Bumetanide inhibited non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic contraction induced by electrical field stimulation of bronchi pretreated with atropine (1 microM) and indomethacin (5 microM) and this inhibition was inversely related to the frequency of stimulation, suggesting that bumetanide may be inhibiting transmitter release at the prejunctional level. Bumetanide and frusemide did not inhibit the responses to exogenous acetylcholine (0. 1 microM) or neurokinin A (1 nM). CONCLUSIONS: Bumetanide and frusemide in doses that are known to inhibit non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic contraction due to electrical field stimulation failed to inhibit the response to <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> in guinea pig airways...|$|R
