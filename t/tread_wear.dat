50|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>worn</b> away completely: {{especially}} when the wear on the outer rubber exposes the reinforcing threads within, the tire {{is said to be}} bald and must be replaced as soon as possible. Sometimes tires with <b>worn</b> <b>tread</b> are recapped, i.e. a new layer of rubber with grooves is bonded onto the outer perimeter of a worn tire. Since this bonding may occasionally come loose, new tires are considered superior to recapped ones.|$|R

5000|$|In tires, tread {{thickness}} {{and shape}} {{has much to}} do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance Thus, the [...] "fastest" [...] bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire <b>tread</b> <b>wears</b> out.|$|R
50|$|Aeris - Aeris by Stemco is an {{automated}} tire inflation system that simultaneously monitors tire pressure while reducing <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> and alerts operators when tires {{are in need}} of maintenance or replacement.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{abnormal}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear.</b> Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear {{to the center of}} the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear. See also Work load above.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wear</b> of tire <b>treads</b> at roads {{surfaces}} {{is measured}} as abrasion resistance. Off – road behavior of tire treads on surfaces with sharp stones {{is not well}} characterized by abrasion resistance as the mechanism of rubber damage is here rather different. The sharp edges of stones can cut a rubber tread surfaces and gradually tear off bigger pieces of rubber (chip – chunk). The aim {{of this article is}} evaluation of chip – chunk behavior of different rubber compounds and evaluation process of tire <b>treads</b> <b>wear.</b> The process of the damage of tire tread is described in this article...|$|R
5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the <b>tread</b> lugs are <b>worn</b> to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the <b>tread</b> is <b>worn</b> down to that point.|$|R

50|$|The Uniform Tire Quality Grading System (UTQG), is {{a system}} for {{comparing}} the performance of tires, established by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration according to the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 575.104.

50|$|In {{the late}} thirties {{there had been}} several {{projects}} to improve the Renault R35 light infantry tank. One of these was directed to {{the improvement of the}} horizontal rubber spring suspension system that, apart from being less reliable than originally hoped for, caused an uncomfortable ride, high track and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> and an unfavourable weight distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Sidewall {{deflection}} is not {{a direct}} measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall. Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] tread design will only benefit until the <b>tread</b> <b>wears</b> down.|$|R
50|$|The tread of a tire or track {{refers to}} the rubber on its {{circumference}} that makes contact with the road or the ground. As tires are used, the <b>tread</b> is <b>worn</b> off, limiting its effectiveness in providing traction. A worn tire can often be retreaded.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that conical wheels and rails that are sloped by the same amount follow curves better than cylindrical wheels and vertical rails. A few railways such as Queensland Railways {{for a long time}} had cylindrical wheels until much heavier traffic required a change.Cylindrical wheel treads have to [...] "skid" [...] on track curves so increase both drag and rail and wheel wear. On very straight track a cylindrical wheel tread rolls more freely and does not [...] "hunt." [...] The gauge is narrowed slightly and the flange fillets keep the flanges from rubbing the rails.United States practice is a 1 in 20 cone when new. As the <b>tread</b> <b>wears</b> it approaches an unevenly cylindrical tread, at which time the wheel is trued on a wheel lathe or replaced.|$|R
50|$|Forensic {{tire tread}} {{evidence}} records and analyzes impressions of vehicle tire treads {{for use in}} legal proceedings to help prove the identities of persons at a crime scene. Every tire will show different amounts of <b>tread</b> <b>wear,</b> and different amounts of damage {{in the form of}} tiny cuts and nicks. These unique characteristics will also show on the impression left by the tire.|$|E

50|$|Later, and better, {{patterns}} were the Dunlop 'Traction' tread pattern of 1922 and the 'Triple stud' pattern of 1927. These {{followed the same}} principle of a solid central rib with square-edged blocks, but were developed to improve <b>tread</b> <b>wear.</b> The central rib became a thin and almost vestigial rib between square blocks. The side blocks were now isolated from the centre, although linked by another narrow rib, and their {{leading and trailing edges}} formed a trapezium rather than a square. This triple square stud pattern was a successful pattern for narrow tyres, including motorcycles, and remained popular from several manufacturers into the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Some tires, {{particularly}} {{those with a}} slow leak, can be repaired and re-inflated; others, especially those with <b>worn</b> <b>tread,</b> must be replaced.|$|R

50|$|Tires {{that are}} fully worn can be re-manufactured {{to replace the}} <b>worn</b> <b>tread.</b> This is known as {{retreading}} or recapping, a process of buffing away the <b>worn</b> <b>tread</b> and applying a new tread. Retreading is economical for truck tires because the cost of replacing the tread {{is less than the}} price of a new tire. Retreading passenger tires is less economical because the cost of retreading is high compared to the price of new cheap tires, but favorable compared to high-end brands.|$|R
50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature <b>tread</b> <b>wear,</b> and tread separation in severe cases.|$|E
50|$|Proper vehicle safety {{requires}} specific {{attention to}} inflation pressure, tread depth, and general {{condition of the}} tires. Over-inflated tires {{run the risk of}} explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain combinations of cross ply and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal. Vehicle and tire manufacturers provide owners' manuals with instructions on how to check and maintain tires.|$|E
50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the wheel tread. Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence maximum wheel <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} wheel tread, a packing is placed under the flange of the lower spring seat. This packing ring is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material. The thickness of the NFTC packing ring is equal to 50% of the difference between the dia of a new wheel and the wheel in question.|$|E
50|$|Many higher-performing tires {{include an}} {{extruded}} component between the belt package and the tread {{to isolate the}} <b>tread</b> from mechanical <b>wear</b> from the steel belts.|$|R
5000|$|Retread, {{also known}} as [...] "recap," [...] or a [...] "remold" [...] is a re-manufacturing process for tires that replace the <b>tread</b> on <b>worn</b> tires. Retreading is applied to casings of spent tires that have been {{inspected}} and repaired. It preserves about 90% of the material in spent tires and the material cost is about 20% compared to manufacturing a new one.|$|R

40|$|Motor vehicle {{end-users}} {{approaches to}} tyre safety issues in automobiles translate {{to a number}} of tyre failure risk factors. This study basically assessed <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> pattern of tyres in passenger cars used on Nigeria roads. The result obtained showed that 75. 4 % of the assessed tyres showed uneven wear pattern resulting from incorrect tyre-road contact effects. This observed high proportion of uneven tyre <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> pattern implies high rate of inconsequential regard for tyre safety...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> {{particles}} are investigated: <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> particles from a steel brush abrader (TrBP) and particles produced during a steering pad run (TrSP). A leaching experiment in water at pH = 7. 5 for 24 and 48 h {{was carried out}} on TrBP to simulate environmental degradation. Images of all materials were collected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with element microanalytical (EDX) data. Surface morphology is described by a function of wave number (the “enhanced spectrum”) obtained from SEM image analysis and non-linear filtering. A surface roughness index, ρ, {{is derived from the}} enhanced spectrum. The innovative contribution of this work is the representation of morphology by means of ρ, which, together with EDX data, allows the quantitative characterization of the materials. In particular, the surface roughness of leached TrBP is shown to decay in time and is related to the corresponding microanalytical data for the first time. The morphology of steering pad TrSP, affected by included mineral particles, is shown to be more heterogeneous. Differences in morphology (enhanced spectra and ρ), elemental composition and surface chemistry of TrBP and TrSP are discussed. All methods described and implemented herewith can be immediately applied to other types of <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> material. The arguments put forward herewith should help in the proper design of those experiments aimed at assessing the impact of <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> materials on the environment and on human health...|$|E
50|$|Street tires {{will also}} include wear limit {{indicators}} {{in the form}} of small raised bridges within the grooves. When the <b>tread</b> is <b>worn</b> down enough that the limit indicators make contact with the road, the tire is deemed to be {{at the end of its}} service life.

25|$|Ajith did {{not speak}} Tamil as a child, and {{mastered}} it only after becoming an actor. He dropped out of Asan Memorial Senior Secondary School in 1986 before completing his higher secondary. During his childhood, {{he had been a}} fan of M. G. Ramachandran, Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna. In his teenage years, he became a fan of Tamil acting icons Rajnikanth and Kamal Haasan. At 18, Ajith had to take up a job to support his career in racing. Joining as an apprentice, he rose to be a merchandiser with a garment export company, doing small-time press ads and TV commercials occasionally. He had put a lot of money into racing and would borrow tyres from his friends who used to help when the <b>treads</b> <b>wore</b> out, as there was no money in racing at that time. Following an accident, several business agencies pushed him into modelling for advertisements in print media. He had to make a choice between films and racing, and as the films were happening and generating him some money, he began concentrating on it. He debuted in En Veedu En Kanavar (1990) in a minor role as a school student.|$|R
