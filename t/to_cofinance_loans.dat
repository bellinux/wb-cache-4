40|$|Cofinancing is a {{term used}} in the movie {{industry}} to describe films for which multiple firms share the cost of production and revenues. We find that one-third of movies produced by major studios between 1987 and 2000 are cofinanced. Anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that cofinancing is {{for the purpose of}} risk management. However, the major studios are publicly traded firms, which allows investors to make their own diversification decisions, leading us to question the importance of cofinancing for risk management. Contrary to industry-claims, we find that cofinancing decisions are unrelated to the distribution of individual movie returns—studios do not appear <b>to</b> <b>cofinance</b> relatively risky films. But we do find that studios are more likely <b>to</b> <b>cofinance</b> movies that account for a large fraction of their total annual production budget, which reduces portfolio risk via the law of large numbers. Toward an alternative explanation for cofinancing, we also find that cofinancing between two major studios impacts the release dates of their other movies...|$|R

40|$|Can {{a country}} grow faster by saving more? We address this {{question}} both theoretically and empirically. In our model, growth results from innovations that allow local sectors {{to catch up}} with the frontier technology. In relatively poor countries, catching up with the frontier requires the involvement of a foreign investor, who is familiar with the frontier technology, together with effort on the part of a local bank, who can directly monitor local projects to which the technology must be adapted. In such a country, local saving matters for innovation, and therefore growth, because it allows the domestic bank <b>to</b> <b>cofinance</b> projects and thus to attract foreign investment. But in countries close to the frontier, local firms are familiar with the frontier technology, and therefore do not need to attract foreign investment to undertake an innovation project, so local saving does not matter for growth. In our empirical exploration we show that lagged savings is significantly associated with productivity growth for poor but not for rich countries. This effect operates entirely through TFP rather than through capital accumulation. Further, we show that savings is significantly associated with higher levels of FDI inflows and equipment imports and that the effect that these have on growth is significantly larger for poor countries than rich. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{continuing}} {{search for new}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), reasonable candidates are the secretase enzymes involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), {{as well as the}} large proteolytic cleavage fragments sAPPα and sAPPβ. The enzymatic activities of some of these secretases, such as BACE 1 and TACE, have been investigated as potential AD biomarkers, and it has been assumed that these activities present in human CSF result from the soluble truncated forms of the membrane-bound enzymes. However, we and others recently identified soluble forms of BACE 1 and APP in CSF containing the intracellular domains, as well as the multi-pass transmembrane presenilin- 1 (PS 1) and other subunits of γ-secretase. We also review recent findings that suggest that most of these soluble transmembrane proteins could display self-association properties based on hydrophobic and/or ionic interactions leading to the formation of heteromeric complexes. The oligomerization state of these potential new biomarkers needs to be taken into consideration for assessing their real potential as CSF biomarkers for AD by adequate molecular tools.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{a public}} institution chooses the optimal contract (cofinancing rate) in funding agricultural R&D research projects. A theoretical model is developed within a principal-agent framework {{taking into account}} the asymmetric information both players have to handle. The researcher (the agent) initially does not know the cofinancing granted by the funding institution (the principal). This latter, in turn, only observes some objective features of the researchers and of the selected research projects and, ex post, the research outcome, but not the agent's actual effort on the project. The principal uses the available information <b>to</b> offer the <b>cofinancing</b> rate (the contract) that, under specific contractual clauses, induces the agent's effort that maximizes principal's utility. The model eventually assumes the form of a Stackelberg-type game. An empirically testable relation is also derived from the theoretical model and is then applied to the agricultural R&D programme funded by the Italian region Emilia-Romagna over years 2001 - 2006.

40|$|The {{development}} of nano and micro delivery systems (DS), so small in size, {{is growing in}} importance, such as in drug targeting. In an era where nano is the new trend, micro and nano materials are {{in the forefront of}} progress. These systems can be produced by a diversity of methods. However, the use of high-intensity ultrasound offers an easy and versatile tool for nano- and microstructured materials that are often unavailable by conventional methods. Similarly to the synthesis methods that can be used, several starting materials can be applied to produce particulate systems. In this review, the recent strategic {{development of}} DS is discussed with emphasis on liposomes and polymer-based, specially protein-based, nanomedicine platforms for drug delivery. Among the variety of applications that materials in the particulate form can have, the control release of drugs is probably the most prominent one, as these have been in the forefront line of interest for biomedical applications. The basic concepts of sonochemical process pertaining to DS are summarized as well as the role of sonochemical procedure to their preparation.

40|$|Presenilin- 1 (PS 1) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the γ-secretase complex. In this study, we explore if PS 1 participates in the processing of the cholinergic acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The major AChE variant expressed in the brain is a tetramer (G 4) bound to a proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA). Overexpression of the transmembrane PRiMA protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing AChE and treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3, 5 -difluorophenacetyl) -l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester have enabled us to study whether, through its γ-secretase activity, PS 1 participates in the processing of PRiMA-linked AChE. γ-Secretase inhibition led to a notable {{increase in the level}} of PRiMA-linked AChE, suggesting that γ-secretase is involved in the cleavage of PRiMA. We demonstrate that cleavage of PRiMA by γ-secretase results in a C-terminal PRiMA fragment. Immunofluorescence labeling allowed us to identify this PRiMA fragment in the nucleus. Moreover, we have determined changes in the proportion of the raft-residing AChE-PRiMA in a PS 1 conditional knockout mouse. Our results are of interest as both enzymes have therapeutic relevance for Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. MLC is supported by a Consolider-Predoctoral fellowship from the CSIC, Spain.

40|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the {{predominant}} serum immunoglobulin {{and has the}} longest serum half-life of all the antibody classes. The European rabbit IgG has been of significant importance in immunological research, and is therefore well characterized. However, the IgG of other leporids has been disregarded. To evaluate the evolution of this gene in leporids, we sequenced the complete IGHG for six other genera: Bunolagus, Brachylagus, Lepus, Pentalagus, Romerolagus and Sylvilagus. The newly sequenced leporid IGHGgene has an organization and structure {{similar to that of}} the European rabbit IgG. A gradient in leporid IgG constant domain diversity was observed, with the CH 1 being the most conserved and the CH 3 the most variable domain. Positive selectionwas found to be acting on all constant domains, but with a greater incidence in the CH 3 domain, where a cluster of three positively selected siteswas identified. In the hinge region, only three polymorphic positions were observed. The same hinge length was observed for all leporids. Unlike the variation observed for the European rabbit, all 11 Lepus species studied share exactly the same hinge motif, suggesting its maintenance as a result of an advantageous structure or conformation.

40|$|The authors {{examine how}} governments finance and {{allocate}} public spending, {{with an eye}} to developing strategies for pricing publicly provided health services. They also examine the implications of current policy and the possibility for rationalizing competing government priorities. Because governments face budget constraints and cannot fully subsidize all programs and activities, the authors argue the following: a) Public spending on health can (1) improve health outcomes, (2) promote nonhealth aspects of well-being (for example, reducing individuals'risk of economic losses from random health crises), and (3) finance redistribution to the poor. Optimal subsidy and fee policy will depend on how much relative weight government places on those competing objectives. Subsidies need to be reallocated toward the poor and toward public health sector can financed by increasing public subsidies. b) Prices for curative services (user fee) have two distinct roles. They can raise revenue, freeing public resources to be reallocated to public health activities and for limited <b>cofinancing</b> <b>to</b> improve the quality of curative care. More important, they can improve efficiency in the use of public facilities and the health care system as a whole. But those gains must be weighed against evidence that increased fees can compromise public health's three main goals. The literature has focused largely on how raising revenue affects the poor, but the more important effect {{is likely to be the}} guidance of resources. User fees are important in cofinancing health care but shouldn't be the primary means of finance. c) Revenue generated from user fees is sometimes used to improve the quality of, and access to, curative medical care. There is some evidence that people are willing to pay some of the cost of improving health care (especially for drugs), but the wealthy are willing to pay a lot more than the poor. If governments charge the average"willingness to pay,"the wealthy will use the services more, the poor, less. d) Prepayment social insurance plans hold promise, but there is evidence that they may introduce inefficient inflation of medical care costs that lower- and middle- income countries cannot afford.

40|$|Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) is a class-I helical cytokinewith a broad {{spectrum}} of biological activities and a gene structure conserved throughout vertebrates, with five coding exons. IL- 6 from European rabbits belonging to the subspecies Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus was previously shown to differ from other mammals by extending an additional 27 amino acids. However, in other leporids (Sylvilagus spp and Lepus spp) that diverged from the European rabbit ~ 12 million years ago this mutation was not present. In this study, we extended the study of IL- 6 for the Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus subspecies and five additional lagomorphs’ genera(Brachylagus, Bunolagus, Pentalagus, Romerolagus, and Ochotona). We confirmed the presence of the mutated stop codon in both O. c. cuniculus and O. c. algirus. We found that the typical stop codon is present in Sylvilagus bachmani and Lepus europaeus, in agreement with previous reports, but also in Bunolagus, Brachylagus, and Ochotona. Remarkably, in Pentalagus we detected a deletion of the stop codon causing an extension of IL- 6 for 17 extra residues. Our results indicate that the IL- 6 extension in those species occurred by two independent events: one occurred between 2 and 8 million years ago in the ancestral of the Oryctolagus subspecies, and the other occurred in a Pentalagus ancestral at a maximum of 9 million years ago. The absence of this IL- 6 extension in Bunolagus, sister genus of Oryctolagus, shows that this evolutionary event happened by convergence suggesting some functional relevance.

40|$|Cystatins are {{a family}} of inhibitors of {{cysteine}} peptidases that comprises the salivary cystatins (D and S-type cystatins) and cystatin C. These cystatins are encoded by a multigene family (CST 3, CST 5, CST 4, CST 1 and CST 2) organized in tandem in the human genome. Their presence and functional importance in human saliva has been reported, however the distribution of these proteins in other mammals is still unclear. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of the saliva of several mammals and studied the evolution of this multigene family. The proteomic analysis detected S-type cystatins (S, SA, and SN) in human saliva and cystatin D in rat saliva. The evolutionary analysis showed that the cystatin C encoding gene is present in species of the most representative mammalian groups, i. e. Artiodactyla, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Carnivora and Primates. On the other hand, D and S-type cystatins are mainly retrieved from Primates, and especially the evolution of S-type cystatins {{seems to be a}} dynamic process as seen in Pongo abelii genome where several copies of CST 1 -like gene (cystatin SN) were found. In Rodents, a group of cystatins previously identified as D and S has also evolved. Despite the high divergence of the amino acid sequence, their position in the phylogenetic tree and their genome organization suggests a common origin with those of the Primates. These results suggest that the D and S type cystatins have emerged before the mammalian radiation and were retained only in Primates and Rodents. Although the mechanisms driving the evolution of cystatins are unknown, {{it seems to be a}} dynamic process with several gene duplications evolving according to the birth-and-death model of evolution. The factors that led to the appearance of a group of saliva-specific cystatins in Primates and its rapid evolution remain undetermined, but may be associated with an adaptive advantage.
