The wooden porch on the south facade has been established as an original {{part of the building}} by a family photograph.

50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E

50|$|Jackson {{wanted to}} {{engineer}} a strong, comfortable wooden chair {{that could be}} mass-produced cost-effectively. To achieve this, he turned to Computer Numerical Control cutting technology, or CNC as it is more commonly known, {{and became one of}} the first independent furniture manufacturers in the US to acquire the equipment. Although “deceptively simple-looking,” Jackson’s design for the Library Chair features compound curves, a hidden <b>Tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> between seat and back planes that bend in different directions, and arms that are joined to both the back legs and seat back on either side. The CNC cutter’s ability to move though complex cutting operations, switching tools as needed, enabled Jackson’s woodworkers to shape the chair’s components efficiently and with precision. Doing this work in-house at his factory in Long Island City allowed Jackson to produce the chair at a low unit cost and sell the chair at a competitive price.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the next}} major phase of activity, 30 {{enormous}} Oligocene-Miocene sarsen stones (shown grey on the plan) {{were brought to the}} site. They may have come from a quarry around 25 mi north of Stonehenge on the Marlborough Downs, or they may have been collected from a [...] "litter" [...] of sarsens on the chalk downs, closer to hand. The stones were dressed and fashioned with mortise and tenon joints before 30 were erected as a 33 m diameter circle of standing stones, with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top. The lintels were fitted to one another using another woodworking method, the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> Each standing stone was around 4.1 m high, 2.1 m wide and weighed around 25 tons. Each had clearly been worked with the final visual effect in mind; the orthostats widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant when viewed from the ground, while the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument.|$|E

40|$|A {{vibration}} based structural assessment {{campaign was}} carried out on a r. c. segmental bridge in North East Italy. The bridge has a cantilever static scheme, fixed {{at the top of}} the piers and with a hinge at the centre of the span. The particular configuration of the hinge consists in a couple of steel elements, each one composed by a <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> Since the year 1960, the hinge was subjected to consumption and degradation, that caused a malfunctioning of the device. An intervention of rehabilitation of the bridge led to a reinforcement of the existing hinges with the coupling of new metallic devices: new tongue and groove hinges were applied, that by one side allow the horizontal displacements and rotation, by the other side strongly reduce the relative vertical displacements of the two parts of the bridge. A dynamic test campaign was set up in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The principal dynamic parameters were calculated and analysed with respect to the intervention that was realized. The tests clearly showed the effectiveness of the intervention, and helped the designer to have a better understanding of the structural behaviour of the bridge...|$|E
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Lightweight structural sandwich panels made of two thin steel facings, {{which are}} bonded {{to a relatively}} thick and light insulating mineral wool core, are often used for wall claddings. The sandwich panel clad structures are frequently weakened by cut-outs and openings for doors, windows, and in other cases. If the resistance of remaining cross-section of a weakened panel is not sufficient an additional load-bearing support of adjacent panels through the longitudinal joints must be activated. The paper concerns effects of large openings on load-bearing capacity and structural stiffness of sandwich panel claddings. Since {{it is not possible}} to give generally acceptable rules to evaluate their complex structural behaviour at the present time this research project was conducted using finite element models to study the local and global behaviour for a certain sandwich panel product and a certain design examples. Firstly, a finite element model of double interlocking <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> between neighbouring panels was built to study behaviour of the panel-to-panel connection. Secondly, finite element models of two typical design examples of sandwich panel claddings with large opening and load transfer from weakened sandwich panel through the longitudinal joints to the adjacent panels were built and analysed numerically. And thirdly, the laboratory experiment of two studied design examples was also conducted. The results obtained from the experiment were reasonably agreeable to support the finit...|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} residence is {{a single}} storeyed timber building facing north with a rectangular plan and verandahs lining the two long sides. Part of the verandah has been closed in creating additional rooms. The main gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron and reduces in pitch at the verandah line. The timber construction technique is unusual, without visible horizontal support and using very high quality and well finished cedar slabs. The foundations of the building are a system of load-bearing bed logs that support floor joists <b>and</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> timber floors. The single skinned wall construction comprises regular 2 inch thick cedar boards measuring about 10 inches wide, joined with beaded <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> fixed into the foundations below the floor boards and into the ceiling joists above the ceiling, resulting {{in the absence of}} visible horizontal timber members.

40|$|Plank (tongue and groove) wood decking is {{a product}} that is {{commonly}} used in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs and floors. In 2010, The National Building Code of Canada changed the application area of the specified concentrated roof live loads from 750 mm x 750 mm to 200 mm x 200 mm. The change was made to better reflect the area which a construction worker with equipment occupies. Preliminary analysis showed that {{the change in the}} application area of concentrated loads may {{have a significant impact on}} the design of decking systems. Little research or development has been done on plank decking since the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. An experimental program was undertaken at the University of Ottawa’s structural laboratory to better understand the behaviour of plank decking under uniformly distributed and concentrated loads. Non-destructive and destructive tests were conducted on plank decking systems to investigate their stiffness and failure mode characteristics under uniformly distributed as well as concentrated loads. The experimental test program was complimented with a detailed finite element model in order to predict the behaviour of a plank decking system, especially the force transfer between decks through the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> The study showed that the published deflection coefficients for uniformly distributed loads can accurately predict the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009). For unbalanced uniformly distributed loads on two-span continuous layup, it was found that the deflection coefficient of 0. 42 was non-conservative. It was also found that under concentrated loads, the stiffness of the decking system increased significantly as more boards were added. A deflection coefficient of 0. 40 is appropriate to calculate the deflection for the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009) under concentrated load on an area of 200 mm by 200 mm. Significant load sharing was observed for plank decking under concentrated loads. An increase in capacity of about 1. 5 to 2. 5 times the capacity of the loaded boards was found. Furthermore, it was found that placing sheathing on top of a decking system had a significant effect in the case of concentrated load with an increase of over 50 % in stiffness and over 100 % in ultimate capacity...|$|E

40|$|Blockhaus {{structural}} {{systems are}} obtained by assembling multiple timber logs able {{to interact with}} each other by means of simple mechanisms (e. g. contacts, <b>tongues</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooves,</b> <b>and</b> carpentry <b>joints,</b> also referred to as 'corner' joints). Although these systems have ancient origins, the structural behaviour of Blockhaus systems under well-defined loading and boundary conditions is still complex to predict. The paper focuses on the assessment of the typical buckling behaviour and resistance of in-plane compressed timber log-walls. The effects of various mechanical and geometrical aspects such as in-plane rigid inter-storey floors, load eccentricities, different types of lateral restraints, openings (e. g. doors or windows) or additional metal stiffeners, are investigated by means of full-scale buckling experiments. Results are then critically discussed and preliminarily assessed via analytical formulations taken from classical theory of plate buckling and column buckling. Although further advanced studies are required {{for the development of a}} generalized buckling design method, it is shown that several mechanical and geometrical aspects should be properly taken into account to correctly predict the structural capacity of Blockhaus systems under in-plane compression...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove.</b> The two <b>joint</b> halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|R
