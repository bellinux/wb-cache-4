5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> the spherical finial with black cloth {{and place a}} black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E

5|$|Upon its premiere, the two-episode finale was {{watched by}} 3.35 million viewers. The episodes {{received}} generally positive reviews from commentators, {{many of whom}} felt that the series was successfully able <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> up its story arcs. Rosenbaum's return was met with critical applause; however, the artistic decision to not show Welling in the full Superman suit and instead to render Superman using computer-generated imagery (CGI) was met with negativity.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E

Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn.

5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|Samaras did {{eventually}} {{sign for}} a North American Soccer League team, joining expansion side Rayo OKC on 10 March 2016. On 2 April, {{he made his}} debut in their first match, replacing Robbie Findley for the final 12 minutes of a goalless home draw against FC Edmonton. He {{was the last of}} three of the team's players sent off on 28 May in a 1–0 loss at Soccer Bowl holders the Cosmos. Samaras' first goal for the franchise came on 16 July in his 9th match, coming on as a late substitute <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> up a 3–0 win over the same opponent at the Miller Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E

5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where it was used <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough {{brought it to}} the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, developed into a subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it was treated as a frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E

5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers was created <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger. Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross {{is not a}} remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in Radical Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E
5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two days, however, the system became much more organized. Early on August21, the National Hurricane Center had {{initiated}} advisories on Tropical Depression Eight-E. After the existence of banding features was noted, the intensity was increased to 40mph (65km/h), indicating that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, which was named Fausto by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Although no further strengthening initially occurred, Fausto began to intensify after a burst in convection early on August22. Rapid deepening began to occur thereafter, and the NHC noted that Fausto exhibited a classic-type banding feature and {{also noted that the}} outflow was increasing. The large size and widespread convection closely resembled a system that would become a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. The associated banding features began <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> completely around the system, and evidence of a developing eye was seen via weather satellite. Simultaneously, satellite estimates made via the Dvorak technique indicated that intensity of Fausto was 75mph (120km/h), and as a result, the NHC upgraded it to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{his first}} Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 {{in the first}} Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in {{first-class}} cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests. India went on <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali, his second highest ODI score. He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won.|$|E
5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
40|$|We {{take the}} first step in {{extending}} the integrability approach to one-point functions in AdS/dCFT to higher loop orders. More precisely, we argue that the formula encoding all tree-level one-point functions of SU(2) operators in the defect version of N= 4 SYM theory, dual to the D 5 -D 3 probe-brane system with flux, has a natural asymptotic generalization to higher loop orders. The asymptotic formula correctly encodes the information about the one-loop correction to the one-point functions of non-protected operators once dressed by a simple flux-dependent factor, as we demonstrate by an explicit computation involving a novel object denoted as an amputated matrix product state. Furthermore, when applied to the BMN vacuum state, the asymptotic formula gives a result for the one-point function which in a certain double-scaling limit agrees with that obtained in the dual string theory up <b>to</b> <b>wrapping</b> order.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{wrapping}} surfaces on muscle paths and moment arms of the semispinalis capitis muscle, {{one of the major}} extensors of the neck. Sensitivities <b>to</b> <b>wrapping</b> surface size and the vertebral segment to which it was kinematically linked were evaluated. We found that kinematic linkage, but not radius, had a significant effect on the accuracy of model muscle paths compared to muscle centroid paths from magnetic resonance images (MRI). Both radius and kinematic linkage affected the estimated moment arm significantly. The wrapping surfaces that provided the best match to centroid paths had the most consistent moment arm curves. For some radius and linkage combinations that produced poor matches to the centroid path, a kinematic method (tendon excursion) predicted flexion moment arms in certain postures, whereas geometrically they should be extensions. This occurred because in these cases the muscle length increased as it wrapped around the surface. This study highlights the sensitivity of model moment arms <b>to</b> <b>wrapping</b> surface parameters and the importance of accurately modelling muscle path to obtain better estimates of moment arm...|$|R
