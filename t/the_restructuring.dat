He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> MMPI- 2 <b>restructured</b> clinical scales {{and the original}} clinical scales was evaluated using an outpatient clinical sample (N = 150). Similar patterns of cor-relations to those reported by Tellegen et al. in 2003, such as high correlations between <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> scales and their original scale counterparts and lower intercorrelations among <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> scales than among the original scales, {{were found in the}} outpatient sample. The former provided evidence of convergence between the two sets of scales, whereas the lat-ter increases the potential for discriminant validity in <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> scale profiles. Mean T-scores of <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> scales were significantly lower than their original scale counter-parts for every clinical scale except Scale 1 (hypochondriasis). Individual profiles exhibited fewer scale elevations using <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> clinical scales (M = 2. 15, Mdn = 2. 0) than the original clinical scales (M = 3. 29, Mdn = 3. 0). The majority of client profiles (56 %) had fewer scale elevations when plotted using <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> scales versus <b>the</b> original clinical scales...|$|R

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of <b>the</b> <b>restructuring,</b> in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form Rail Link Engineering (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the Eurostar (UK) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways); electricity company EDF; and UBS Investment Bank. On completion of section 1 by RLE, the line was handed over to Union Railways (South), which then handed it over to London & Continental Stations and Property (LCSP), the long-term owners of the line. Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed over to Union Railways (North), which handed it over to LCSP.

Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. <b>The</b> <b>restructuring</b> of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. <b>The</b> <b>restructuring</b> took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{remained}} in Germany {{in support of}} V Corps for almost 25 years, seeing no deployments.

Though three of the brigade's subordinate battalions deployed to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the brigade headquarters itself {{remained in}} Germany {{along with the rest of}} V Corps. The operations were conducted by VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps, which had significant engineer assets of their own. Throughout the early 1990s, the brigade would continue to see units come and go from its command as they were transferred from <b>the</b> <b>restructuring</b> 18th Engineer Brigade and the deactivating 7th Engineer Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The company sold $750 {{million in}} assets, {{including}} Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, {{in order to}} pay $1 billion in debt. Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000. In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations. Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel. By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>restructuring,</b> Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp.

5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernible from the distance as a man-made structure. The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many military operations.

The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians.
