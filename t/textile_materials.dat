25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and <b>textile</b> <b>materials.</b> By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or Breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and annona.|$|E

Stable and eco-friendly o/w nanoemulsion of tetrahydroxy curcumin derivative was developed by using high pressure homogenization method. The stable nanoemulsion for the selected drug was developed and evaluated for appearance, particle size distribution (100 – 300  nm), zeta potential (−  30.1 to −  31.1  mV) and drug content (80 – 83.3 %). Nanoemulsion containing antimicrobial drug were impregnated on the <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> by exhaust methods using β-cyclodextrin and polycarboxylic acid as a crosslinking agent. Treated <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> is evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against standard antimicrobial strip using both AATCC 147 and AATCC 100, treated samples shows positive results against {{both positive and negative}} bacteria.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to address two main {{ways of dealing with}} used <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> in Czech Republic. It compares <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> as a {{component}} of a household waste with <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> as a component of a segregated waste. The main question that the thesis and the research done within it addresses is whether the costs, associated with textile waste management coming as the result of administrative tools and legislative action plans mounted to it, are not too high. Based on a calculated model of cost structure of both above mentioned variants their comparison could be performed. Analysis of its results pointed out, that under certain given conditions and assumptions the system of segregated waste collection is, despite its higher costs, effective. The outcome of this master thesis is proposed possible scenarios used to optimize textile waste management in the context of economic science methodology, available data and primary research questions...|$|R
