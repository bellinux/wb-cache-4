40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine upper-body {{repeated}} sprint performance, physiological responses, and the relationships to technique and muscle co-ordination. Methods: Twelve male elite cross-country skiers (body mass: 75. 4 ± 7. 1, VO 2 max: 73 ± 4) were tested for repeated sprint ability during 8 · 8 -s maximal poling with 22 -s breaks sprint using a modified poling ergometer. <b>Total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (i. e. mean power of all sprints added together) and the sprint decrement (i. e. difference in percent between <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> and best single sprint power times 8) determined performance. Applied forces were measured with a force cell, the movement frequencies and velocity of the movement using high-speed infrared cameras, muscle activation by surface electromyography of biceps and triceps, oxygen consumption was continuously measured breath by breath and blood lactate in the breaks between each sprint. Furthermore, peak power was determined from the first 8 -s sprint and VO 2 peak during a 3 -min all-out ergometer poling test. Results: The average <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was 2246 ± 387 W. The average sprint decrement was 11. 7 % after eight sprints. Poling rate did not change, while power per stroke decreased during the eight sprints (p< 0. 05). Activation of biceps brachii increased- and triceps brachii decreased during the repeated sprint exercise, however these changes did not correlate with the changes in performance. Furthermore there was a change in the timing of the triceps in the last two sprints. The greatest increase in VO 2 occurred between sprint 1 and sprint 2 (p< 0. 05), after which the increase plateaued at a level of 75 % of VO 2 peak. VO 2 peak during a 3 -min all-out poling test correlated with power per stroke in the last three sprints (r = 0. 6 – 0. 7, all p< 0. 05). Total increase in blood lactate correlated with <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (r = 0. 692, p< 0. 05) and sprint decrement (r = 0. 604, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: During repeated sprint exercise with 22 -s breaks a high decrement in power is apparent after the first sprint. The changes in power are related to reduced power per stroke, without any changes in poling rate over all eight sprints. The change in muscle activation suggests an alteration of technique during the two last sprints in order to withstand fatigue. VO 2 peak seems to be important in the latter stages of RSE. Increase in lactate is a fatiguing factor related to sprint decrement, however a large increase in lactate also seems to cause high <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power,</b> suggesting that the ability to enable lactic energy sources enhances high power outputs.

40|$|When {{subjects}} {{stand at}} the center of a fully enclosed room that is rotating at constant velocity, their natural postural sway generates Coriolis forces that destabilize their center of mass and head. We quantitatively assessed how exposure to constant velocity rotation at 10 rpm affected postural control. Twelve subjects stood in a heel-to-toe stance in the rotating room. Each test session involved three phases: (1) pre-rotation, (2) per-rotation, and (3) post-rotation. In each phase, subjects were tested in both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Four measures were used to characterize center of mass movement and head movement: <b>mean</b> sway amplitude, <b>total</b> <b>power,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> frequency, and frequency of maximum power. Each measure was computed for anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway. Both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral head and center of mass sway during rotation had significantly greater mean sway amplitude and total power compared with pre- and post-rotation values. <b>Mean</b> <b>power</b> frequency and frequency of maximum power were little affected. Eyes open conditions were significantly more stable in all test phases than eyes-closed, but vision did not completely suppress the effects of rotation. The greatest effect of rotation was in the eyes-closed condition with mean sway amplitude and total power increasing more than twofold. Inverted pendulum sway was maintained in all phases of both test conditions. No aftereffects of rotation were present after the four 25 -s exposures each subject received. We expect that with longer exposure periods and with active generation of body sway subjects would both adapt to rotation and exhibit post-rotary aftereffects...|$|R

40|$|Tidal energy {{belongs to}} the class of {{intermittent}} but predictable renewable energy sources. In this paper, we consider a compact set of geographically diverse locations, which have been assessed to have significant tidal stream energy, and attempt to find {{the degree to which}} the resource in each location should be exploited so that the aggregate power from all locations has a low variance. An important characteristic of the locations chosen is that there is a good spread in the peak tidal flow times, though the geographical spread is relatively small. We assume that the locations, all on the island of Ireland, can be connected together and also assume a modular set of tidal turbines. We employ multi-objective optimisation to simultaneously minimise variance, maximise mean power and maximise minimum power. A Pareto front of optimal solutions in the form of a set of coefficients determining the degree of tidal energy penetration in each location is generated using a genetic algorithm. While for the example chosen the <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> generated is not great (circa 100 MW), the case study demonstrated a methodology that can be applied to other location sets that exhibit similar delays between peak tidal flow times...|$|E
40|$|When {{analysing}} human {{movement through}} stereophotogrammetry, skin-markers are used. Their movement {{relative to the}} underlying bone {{is known as a}} soft tissue artefact (STA). A mathematical model to estimate subject- and marker-specific STAs generated during a given motor task, is required for both skeletal kinematic estimators and comparative assessment using simulation. This study devises and assesses such a mathematical model using the paradigmatic case of thigh STAs. The model was based on two hypotheses: 1) that the artefact 2 mostly depends on skin sliding, and thus on the angles of hip and knee; 2) that the relevant relationship is linear. These hypotheses were tested using data obtained from passive hip and knee movements in non-obese specimens and from running volunteers endowed with both skin- and pin-markers. Results showed that the proposed model could be calibrated with small residuals and that the thigh artefacts were mostly due to skin sliding, not only ex-vivo, as expected, but also invivo. This was corroborated by the observation that in-vivo, the portion of the artefact not reconstructed by the model fell within a frequency band compatible with soft tissue wobbling and carried a relatively small portion of <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (13 %, on average). Thus, the architecture of our model is feasible both ex-vivo and in-vivo and can, in principle, be used in skeletal kinematics estimators. The generalizability of a calibrated model across different movements was proved doable, albeit limited to movement patterns {{similar to those of the}} calibration movement, even if joint rotation ranges can be remarkably different. Therefore, such a calibrated model can be used for generating realistic STAs for simulation purposes...|$|E

Early speculation regarding the aetiology of fatigue commends that high rate of lactic acid production and a concomitant fall in blood and muscle pH [1], which may have multiple indirect and dir-ect impairing effects on centrally and peripherally medi-ated fatigue-resistance. Caffeine and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) are two supplements frequently consumed to elicit ergogenic effects on high-intensity exercise performance [2].

40|$|Contemporary cardiac {{pacemakers}} are {{powered by}} primary batteries, featuring a limited energy storage. Thus, these devices {{need to be}} replaced after a few years due to battery depletion, causing costs and exposing patients to a risk of complications. To overcome this limitation, pacemakers without primary batteries are desirable. We recently introduced a subcoutaneously implantable pacemaker that is powered by solar cells. Although covered by a skin layer, the implanted solar cells generate power, since {{a significant part of the}} light penetrates the skin. To investigate the real-life feasibility of such an implant and assess the influence of other factors such as weather or human behaviour, we established a study to determine the solar cell’s power output. A wearable irradiation measurement device that continuously measures the output power of the solar cells (3 cells in series, KXOB 22 - 12 X 1 L, IXYS, USA; active cell area = 3. 6 cm^ 2) was developed. The solar cells are covered by two optical filters to mimic the optical properties of human skin. For 6 months, 32 study participants (13 female, 19 male) wore the device during their daily routine. Predominant weather and activity was described using a questionnaire for every day (608 days in <b>total).</b> The measured <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was 105 ± 130 μW for summer (July-August), 66 ± 111 μW for autumn (September-October) and 27 ± 49 μW for winter (November-December).

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamic interference between n interfering bodies or surfaces is solved for the limiting case of small amplitudes. The mathematical {{part of the}} solution rests on a higher order panel method approximating the vorticity transport equation in incompressible flow. The concept of the numerical procedure is briefly outlined and applied to the computation of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments of an engine nacelle suspended from a wing. Unsteady forces and moments resulting from prescribed kinematics of the individual interfering bodies define a mean power during one cycle of motion for any of the degrees of freedom involved in the problem. From this point of view, flutter is determined to be the state of equilibrium of all powers contributing to the balance of <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> for each body. Thus, the set of all flutter solutions (phase shift and amplitude ratio of each individual degree of freedom with respect to a motion of reference) is given completely by the analysis of unsteady aerodynamics. The mechanical parameters of a particular body (mass distribution, parameters of its suspension such as pitch axis, stiffness, etc.) merely select distinct solutions from this set. The final goal of the flutter computation, e. g. a plot of reduced flutter velocity versus the ratio of selected natural frequencies, isobtained from a straightforward linear analysis within this set of solutions. Thereby, forces and moments for each individual reduced frequency provide one complete flutter point in such a plot. The method is applied to the wing/engine interference by including selected high-accuracy solutions of critical flutter regions to systematic investigations computed with lower precision...|$|E

Knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of wave energy is required for locating a wave power plant. This study investigates the variations in wave power at 19 locations covering the Indian shelf seas using the ERA-Interim dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim data is compared with the measured wave parameters in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Along the western shelf seas of India, the seasonal oscillations lead to variation of the wave power from the lowest seasonal mean value (2. 6 kW/m) in the post-monsoon period (October-January) to the highest value (25. 9 kW/m) in the south-west monsoon (June-September) period.

DESIGN: The study included two stages. The first 12 -week period was a nonexercise, within-subject control stage and the second 12 -week period was an exercise training stage. SETTING: Southern Cross University, Australia. SUBJECTS: Twenty-two subjects with stable intermittent claudication were recruited. Their resting and postexercise ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) was 0. 61 +/- 0. 13 and 0. 41 +/- 0. 22, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects trained in the laboratory, 3 sessions per week for 12 weeks.

This dissertation {{is concerned with the}} development of a generic computational model; generic in that it accounts for the essential dynamic behaviour of a typical base-isolated building in order to make predictions of isolation performance.

Both components of the model achieve computational efficiency by assuming they are infinitely long and using periodic structure theory. The development of the model is described systematically, from the modelling of a building and its isolation bearings to that of its foundation. The majority of the work is concerned with the piled-foundation model, which is comprehensive in that it accounts for the vertical, horizontal and rotational motion of the pile heads due to both direct pile-head loading and interaction through wave propagation in the surrounding soil. It is shown that this level of detail is important in the prediction of base isolation efficiency. A key question facing designers is not only how but on what basis base isolation should be assessed, since fundamental problems exist with the existing measures of isolation performance. Power flow analysis is explored and the concept of power flow insertion gain, based on the <b>total</b> <b>mean</b> vibrational <b>power</b> flow entering a building, is introduced as a useful measure of isolation performance. This is shown to offer clear benefits by providing a single measure of performance that is suitable for design purposes. Finally, the development of a prototype force-sensitive vibration isolation bearing is described as a contribution to verifying base-isolation theory with experiments.

40|$|Abstract Purpose: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} (1) right ventricular (RV) <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> during exercise, (2) {{the contribution of}} flow and pressure to RV <b>mean</b> <b>power,</b> and (3) the impact of pulmonary artery pressure on RV function during exercise. Methods: Fifty patients with atrial septal defect (ASD) type secundum (20 open, 30 closed) were enrolled. All underwent standard echocardiography, a bicycle stress echocardiography, and symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was calculated {{as the product of}} RV cardiac output and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP). RV function was assessed using RV fractional area change (FAC) at rest and at peak exercise. Results: RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was linearly related with oxygen uptake (VO 2) in patients with open (R 2 ¼ 0. 88; p< 0. 0001) and closed ASD (R 2 ¼ 0. 90; p< 0. 0001). The increase in RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> was steeper in open than in closed ASD patients (p< 0. 0001). The change in RV cardiac output (7. 13. 4 vs. 5. 72. 4 l/min; p¼ 0. 132) was not statistically different, but the change in mPAP (21. 79. 6 vs. 12. 84. 6 mmHg; p< 0. 0001) and RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (0. 970. 56 vs. 0. 530. 22 W; p¼ 0. 009) were higher in patients with an open ASD. The change in RV FAC from rest to peak exercise was related to peak mPAP in open (R¼ 0. 589; p¼ 0. 010) and closed (R¼ 0. 450; p¼ 0. 021) ASD patients. Conclusion: RV <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> during exercise is higher in patients with an open than in patients with a closed ASD. The workload of the RV in patients with an open ASD is higher at rest due to a left-to-right shunt, at peak exercise due to an additional increase in mPAP. A higher increase in afterload may affect RV function during exercise...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} analysis {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of replacing the standard ammonia refrigeration device with the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 refrigeration device in the food industry. The main reason for replacement {{is to reduce the}} total amount of ammonia in spaces like deep-freezing chambers, daily chambers, working rooms and technical passageways. An ammonia-contaminated area is hazardous to human health and the safety of food products. Therefore the preferred reduced amount of ammonia is accumulated in the Central Refrigeration Engine Room, where the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 device is installed as well. Furthermore, the analysis discusses and compares two left Carnot¢s refrigeration cycles, one for the standard ammonia device and the other for the cascade NH 3 /CO 2 device. Both cycles are processes with two-stage compression and two-stage throttling. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the selected refrigeration cycle is the most cost-effective process because it provides the best numerical values for the total refrigeration factor with respect to the observed refrigeration cycle. The chief analyzed influential parameters of the cascade device are: total refrigeration load, <b>total</b> reactive <b>power,</b> <b>mean</b> temperature of the heat exchanger, evaporating and condensing temperature of the low-temperature part...|$|R
