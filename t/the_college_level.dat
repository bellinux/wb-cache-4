5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all {{high school sports}} in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than <b>the</b> <b>college</b> <b>level.</b> A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E
