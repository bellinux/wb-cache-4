5|$|Extensive {{coverage}} of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number {{of products and}} enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was {{the birthplace of the}} Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. established one of the country's first modern shopping plazas in the suburb of Boardman. <b>The</b> <b>fast-food</b> chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which had been established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have {{banded together to}} form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA). The 900-member group is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and {{is designed to provide}} what the group calls Franchisee Relations Advocacy. It acts as a corporate negotiator that mediates with corporate-franchise disputes, as a government lobbying group to deal with issues that affect <b>the</b> <b>fast-food</b> industry as a whole, and it provides group health, property and casualty insurance. In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E

500|$|To {{appeal to}} the adult market, BK offers several {{sandwiches}} and other products made with higher-quality ingredients such as whole-breast chicken fillets, Angus beef, and other [...] "premium" [...] ingredients. These sandwiches are usually served on a better-quality roll, such as baguettes or corn-dusted potato rolls. Through 2009 and 2010, the company added other higher-end product such as barbecued ribs, grilled fish, an improved grilled chicken sandwich, kebabs, and an extra-thick burger called the Steakhouse XT. Several industry publications claimed that these new offerings disrupt the differentiation between <b>the</b> <b>fast-food</b> and casual-dining markets {{with a combination of}} taste, competitive pricing, speed of service, and convenience. The adult-oriented products of Burger King and its competitors have been criticized by restaurant industry commentators as a temporary blip. The [...] "indulgent" [...] products are seen as blurring the lines between <b>the</b> <b>fast-food</b> and casual-dining market segments and, while they draw in newer customers looking for value, the effect may only be temporary. Once the economic instabilities of the late-2000s recession fade, customers may return to such casual chains as Chili's and leave the fast food chains back where they started in terms of customer numbers and profits.|$|E

Branding himself [...] "Colonel Sanders", the founder became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising. The company's rapid expansion made it too large for Sanders to manage, so in 1964 he sold the company {{to a group of}} investors led by John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack C. Massey.|$|E
