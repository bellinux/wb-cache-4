5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give {{recitals}} to concentration camp survivors. What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> until {{towards the end of}} his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since. Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations. Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent. It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.|$|E

25|$|The {{feature film}} drama, The Accused (1988), was {{loosely based on}} this case. It starred Jodie Foster as the woman {{attacked}} and Kelly McGillis as an Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the case. In press coverage related to the film, McGillis acknowledged that she had survived an assault and rape herself. She discussed her long struggle {{to get over the}} attack, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to help other victims.|$|E
25|$|Interventions {{in primary}} schools were started during the '80s, {{with the basic}} {{objective}} of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told {{that they can have}} their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next year, the Eagles again {{earned a}} wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the Chicago Bears before falling to Tampa Bay. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik {{to them for}} a draft choice. He would finish {{his career as a}} backup to Ron Jaworski five years later. His entire NFL career is usually {{embodied}} in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it.|$|E

25|$|After Schultz's death, it was {{discovered}} {{that he and his wife}} had never gone through an official marriage ceremony, and the possible existence of another wife emerged with the discovery of letters and pictures of another woman and children among his effects at the hotel where he was staying in Newark. This was never resolved, as his common-law wife refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and the mystery woman never came forward. Two other women also called at the morgue to receive his effects, but their identities were never established. Though he was estimated to be worth $7million when he died, no trace of the money was ever found.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{footage and}} the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the {{designers}} {{were allowed to}} re-create the likenesses of the actors who {{had appeared in the}} film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had a bad experience on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009, Sam and Jason {{are inside}} General Hospital {{when it is}} locked down again due to an {{outbreak}} of a bio toxin. The two teamed up to rescue Spinelli when the hospital starts to burn down. Later in the year, Sam helps Jason and Spinelli after they are entrapped by the FBI. Jason, in turn, helps Sam and Spinelli set up a private investigation firm. When Kristina and Michael run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason go after them. Sam is kidnapped by Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roché), {{who is trying to}} lure Jason into a trap. Jason ends up shot by Jerry, who leaves him to die. Sam escapes and rescues Jason. Jason starts hallucinating that he is in Hawaii with Sam. They grow closer as Sam nurses him back to health and end up making love, but decide not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They find the teens and return to Port Charles. After they return, Jason and Sam remain drawn to each other and soon start dating again.|$|E

So what is left <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It's</b> simple, the writing. I can tell that Steven Erikson's writing is filled with wit, charm, philosophical brilliance and a sense of imagination that would humble the most creative of authors. You will be hard-pressed to find his equal in any genre." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland {{showed some}} little embarrassment. [...] "I did. I was going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{in a day}} or two, because it wouldn't be quite {{convenient}} to have Mrs. Heaton out from Chicago just now." ...|$|R
25|$|Michelle (now {{played by}} Jenna Russell) returns to Walford on Christmas Eve and reunites with Sharon, staying with Martin (now played by James Bye) {{and his second}} wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner). Sharon {{suspects}} something is wrong as Michelle has left Mark and Tim behind, but Michelle refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Michelle and Martin reminisce about their family but Stacey is annoyed by Michelle's presence. Michelle announces she {{is going back to}} Florida but Stacey overhears her breaking down on the phone to Tim. Michelle confides in Sharon that Mark has left home with his girlfriend and that she and Tim have not had sex for almost two years. She then tells Sharon that back in Florida she had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor). Sharon allows Michelle to stay with her and Michelle starts drinking alcohol on her own. Sharon and Phil go on holiday, leaving Michelle to look after the home and their children Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau). On Valentine's Day, Preston turns up and he and Michelle kiss passionately. Michelle goes for a job interview at a teaching agency, but fails to get the job as they find out from her references about her relationship with Preston. Michelle insists that he should go home but he tries to win her back, though she is adamant their relationship is over. Michelle then sees Preston with her niece, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), and Preston manipulates Michelle into catching him in bed with Bex, and she realises he is using Bex to make her jealous. The plan apparently works as Michelle and Preston have sex again. Dennis then discovers Michelle and Preston's relationship and starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him trainers and allowing him time off school.|$|E
500|$|University of Florida {{historian}} David Colburn stated, [...] "There is {{a pattern}} of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> they don't want to identify anyone involved, and there's also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And I want you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You must come out.

6000|$|... "Ena," [...] he said, {{dropping}} his voice a little, [...] "what {{are you going}} to do with that child? I have never quite understood your plans. You promised <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> while we were down here." ...|$|R
500|$|In a December 2006 interview, Shearer added, [...] "Now, [...] refuse <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They {{realize it}} was a horrible mistake. They never mention it. It's like they're {{punishing}} [...] for paying attention." [...] In the introduction to the ninth season DVD boxset, series creator Matt Groening describes [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as [...] "one of [...] least favorite episodes". He also called the episode [...] "a mistake" [...] in an interview with Rolling Stone.|$|E
500|$|Jones also evinced an {{interest}} in unidentified flying objects, having first encountered unexplained aerial phenomena at Warrnambool, Victoria, in 1930. He reported witnessing another UFO in October 1957, but admitted that he was [...] "loath <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> publicly lest people should think I was either an incompetent witness or getting a little screwy in the head". In the mid-1960s he patronised the Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation and joined the Victorian UFO Research Society. Jones published his autobiography, From Private to Air Marshal, in 1988. He was Australia's last surviving World WarI ace {{when he died in}} Melbourne on 24August 1992, at the age of 95.|$|E
500|$|Stone has a close {{relationship}} with her family. She says: [...] "I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense." [...] During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield. The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up. The couple refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> publicly, though they made several appearances together. In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{just makes}} me feel {{separated}} from society, when we have <b>to</b> keep <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It’s like — am I even human?...I mean, I know I’m not normal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man {{of large}} {{property}} in the county, ain't he? He used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> representing <b>it.</b> He used {{to speak at the}} Union. Whereabouts do his estates lie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{attention}} to this was but indirect. [...] "It's awfully vulgar <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I can't help feeling that something possibly rather big will come of Mr. Longdon." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1949, she {{appeared}} in the Broadway production of the Clifford Odets play The Big Knife, a fierce indictment of Hollywood. The play was directed by Lee Strasberg and starred John Garfield as a film star who is being blackmailed by a studio boss for killing a child during a car accident some years earlier. At {{the time of the}} accident, the studio covered it up, and now uses it as leverage on the Garfield character. McCracken plays a call girl, Dixie Evans, who was involved in the incident and threatens <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Her acting in the nondancing role was praised by critics, with Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times calling it an [...] "inventive performance of real quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard {{to do it without}} somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|In the episode's audio commentary, Parker only {{comments}} on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment {{that they are not}} supposed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says [...] "Yeah, that's pretty much it." [...] During the commentary in both [...] "201" [...] and [...] "200" [...] Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as [...] "the prophet of the Muslim faith". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] were omitted from the Region 4 release and have been completely omitted from the Region 2 (which contains the predominantly Islamic Middle East and North Africa) release as well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I don't {{really see}} why you want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> ME <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And if you are {{thinking}} that such a story would go down for a moment with Joan as an evidence of your reformation, you're completely out, Dick. Was that your idea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I loved doing it!" [...] she replied, and paused, flushing.
