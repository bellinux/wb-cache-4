40|$|In {{their recent}} paper Bogusz, Neidl-Fisher, and Aderjan {{reported}} {{a comparison of}} the application of l-nitroalkane and alkylarylketone retention index scales (1). They concluded that the former scale shows a much higher reproducibility and improved discrimination power for rapidly eluted drugs. The thrust of the study was that by using standard compounds it is possible to correct he retention indices of the drugs on different columns and to compensate for differences between their relative and absolute retentions. However, this paper is seriously flawed both in its methodology and its conclusions. Firstly, the authors have not used the same methods for the assessment of the two scales, so that any comparison is unjustified. In the correction of the retention indices, different standard compounds were used; desipramine, perphenazine, and <b>triflupromazine</b> (in order of elution) for the alkylarylketones and cocaine, desipramine, and <b>triflupromazine</b> for the nitroalkanes. Since in the latter case cocaine extended {{the early part of the}} scale where retention measurements were most uncertain, naturally it provided a better apparent correction. If the retention index values reported in the paper are corrected for both scales using a common set of standard compounds (diphenhydramine, desipramine, perphenazine, and <b>triflupromazine)</b> the discrimination of the two methods becomes virtually identical and neither method is therefore preferable.

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} effect of <b>Triflupromazine</b> Hcl and {{diazepam}} in combination with propofol as preanaesthetic on haematobiochemical parameters in dogs was carried out. Materials and Methods: 16 clinical cases of dogs undergoing different surgical interventions irrespective of age, sex and breed were allotted randomly in to two groups viz., Group A (<b>Triflupromazine</b> Hcl &# 150; propofol) and Group B (diazepam &# 150; propofol) consisting eight dogs each. Blood samples were collected at different intervals from both the Groups in heparinised syringes as follows: Prior to premedication, fifteen minutes after premedication, fifteen minutes, one hour, six hour, 24 hour and 48 hour after induction with Propofol. The samples were subjected for various hematological and biochemical analysis. Results: Hematology revealed a significant (P 0. 05) fall in total erythrocyte count (TEC), packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb), whereas TLC showed a non significant decrease in both the groups throughout the observation period of 48 hours. In the present study blood glucose level was significantly increased between 15 min to one hour in Group A and 15 min to 6 hours of observation period of the study in Group B.

In addition, sorption data for three neutral benzodiazepines (diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) and the anionic NSAID diclofenac were collected to determine the efficiency to sample non-basic drugs. All tested compounds showed nonlinear isotherms above 1 mmol/L coating, and linear isotherms below 1 mmol/L. The affinity for C 18 /SCX-SPME for tested organic cations without Hbond capacities increased with longer alkyl chains, ranging from logarithmic fiber-water distribution coefficients (log Dfw) of 1. 8 (benzylamine) to 5. 8 (<b>triflupromazine).</b> Amines smaller than benzylamine may thus have limited detection levels, while cationic surfactants with alkyl chain lengths > 12 carbon atoms may sorb too strong to the C 18 /SCX sampler which hampers calibration of the fiber-water relationship in the linear range. The log Dfw for these simple cation structures closely correlates with the octanol-water partition coefficient of the neutral form (Kow,N), and decreases with increased branching and presence of multiple aromatic rings. Oxygen moieties in organic cations decreased the affinity for C 18 /SCX-SPME. Log Dfw values of neutral benzodiazepines were an order of magnitude higher than their log Kow,N. Results for anionic diclofenac species (logKow,N 4. 5, pKa 4. 0, log Dfw 2. 9) indicate that the C 18 -SCX fiber might also be useful for sampling of organic anions. This data supports our theory that C 18 -based coatings are able to sorb ionized compounds through adsorption and demonstrates the applicability of C 18 -based SPME in the measurement of freely dissolved concentrations {{of a wide range of}} ionizable compounds...|$|E

The color intensity reached a max. in 5 min, and was stable for 14 - 25 min. The absorbance max., Beer's law concn. range, and Sandell sensitivity index were: <b>triflupromazine</b> (I) [146 - 54 - 3] 496, 1 - 60, 56. 2; trifluperazine [117 - 89 - 5] 496, 1 - 50, 71. 3; diethazine [60 - 91 - 3] 516, 1 - 25, 37. 9; promazine [58 - 40 - 2] 516, 1 - 28, 35. 1; chlorpromazine [50 - 53 - 3] 530, 2 - 20, 47. 7; and prochlorperazine [58 - 38 - 8] 530 nm, 2 - 21 ppm, 73. 2 ng/cm 2. Recoveries were 98. 37 - 100. 6 % and common excipients did not interfere. Ascorbic acid, SO 32 -, and I- did interfere. The results compared favorably with the British Pharmacopeia method.

40|$|Synopsis [...] The {{effect of}} {{drugs on the}} {{permeability}} of cell membranes has been related to their surface activity and ability to interact with MONOMOLEGULAR FILMS. It was of interest, therefore, to {{determine the influence of}} ULTR•. V•OLET IRRADIATION on these properties of a series of potential PI•OTOSENS•TIZ•Ng DRWS. Chlorpromazine, promazine, <b>triflupromazine,</b> prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine were the drugs used. Monomolecular films of dipahnitoyl lecith,_'n (DPL) were spread onto an aqueous subphase into which one ot the drugs had been dissolved. The drug-film system was exposed to ultraviolet irradia-tion and resultant changes in the DRUG-F•LM INTERACTION were determined. Only chloropro-mazine and prochlorperazine exhibited an immediate, increased interaction with the film tollowing irradiation. Solutions of these same drugs also were irradiated {{in the absence of the}} film and changes in surface pressure were determined. Only chlorpromazine and pro-chlorperazine showed a steady increase in surface pressure during the period of irradiation. A relationship between irradiation-induced changes in surface pressure and reactivity toward a monomolecular film and in vivo photosensitizing properties was developed. A PUOTO-TOXIC INDEX was calculated and related to in vivo data...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{phenothiazine}} derivatives and two phenothiazine-like {{drugs have}} been given in premedication under standard conditions, and sometimes at more than one dose level, to evaluate their desired and toxic effects. Their influence on the course of methohexi-tone-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia was observed, and emetic and other postoperative sequelae noted. Results were compared with those obtained with atropine and atropine plus pethidine. Drugs with dimethylaminopropyl side chains were the most powerful hypnotics but the sedative effect was spoiled by pre-operative restlessness with prome-thazine and <b>triflupromazine,</b> and this complication was also common in compounds with a piperazine side chain. Hypotension was the most frequent disadvantage of the phenothiazines and was of such severity as to curtail the use of several drugs. Propio-mazine (20 - 40 mg) and thiethylperazine (10 mg) were least toxic {{from this point of}} view. The incidence of excitatory phenomena with methohexitone 1. 6 mg/kg varied with the analgesic or antanalgesic action of the premedication. Emetic sequelae were infrequent but perphenazine 5 mg showed most promise as an anti-emetic. Oculogyric crises occurred frequently after 1. 2 - 2. 5 mg fluphenazine and were also seen afte...|$|E
