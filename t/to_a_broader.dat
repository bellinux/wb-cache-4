5|$|Cambodian Rocks was {{the first}} release of its kind, {{followed}} {{by a number of}} similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and other unrelated titles by the same or similar names, inspired by the original or exploiting its weak standing with regard to intellectual property.

5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E

5|$|Monody {{is similar}} to melody-dominated {{homophony}} in that one voice becomes the melody, while another voice assumes the underlying harmony. Monody, however, {{is characterized by a}} single voice with instrumental accompaniment, whereas melody-dominated homophony refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> category of homophonic music, which includes works for multiple voices, not just works for solo voice, as was the tradition with early 17th-century Italian monody.|$|E

5|$|Over {{time the}} synagogue appealed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> {{constituency}} than just Roumanian-American Jews. Nevertheless, membership declined {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century as the upwardly mobile Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. First Roumanian-American was particularly affected: as it was an Orthodox congregation, in order to attend Sabbath services its members had to live within walking distance.|$|E

Waters's performances across Europe in the 1950s and at Newport helped popularize blues <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> audience, especially to whites.

5|$|Flag {{hoisting}} {{ceremonies and}} cultural programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> celebration of all things India.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{contention}} arose {{over what}} kind of institution the Hurva would be. Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, {{who would have been}} more amenable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has been clear that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue and a house of study.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians to refer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is {{not considered to be}} part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
5|$|The US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, who {{had been}} in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to {{pressure}} Diệm into political reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, cronyism, abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw authoritarianism as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.|$|E
