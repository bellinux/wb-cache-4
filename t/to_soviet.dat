5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment <b>to</b> <b>Soviet</b> society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Alexander Shatravka {{published}} his book Pobeg iz Raya (Escape from Paradise) {{in which he}} described {{how he and his}} companions were caught after they illegally crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union to escape from the latter country and, as a result, were confined <b>to</b> <b>Soviet</b> psychiatric hospitals and prisons.

Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to by the CIA as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{escalated}} the Cold War, accelerating {{a reversal}} from {{the policy of}} détente which began in 1979 after the Soviet war in Afghanistan.

5|$|After the Revolution, Prokofiev left Russia {{with the}} {{official}} blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, {{with whom he had}} two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned <b>to</b> <b>Soviet</b> Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé, Peter and the Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky.|$|E

Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment.
