In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E

However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions. The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.|$|E
