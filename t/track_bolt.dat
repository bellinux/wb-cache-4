5000|$|Another {{solution}} considered was to lay {{a temporary}} plank road ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a [...] Holt steamer, No. 77, {{with a set of}} wooden <b>tracks</b> <b>bolted</b> to chains.

5000|$|A bolt is an {{externally}} threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an {{externally threaded}} fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An {{externally threaded fastener}} which {{is prevented from being}} turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head <b>bolts,</b> <b>track</b> <b>bolts,</b> plow bolts.) An externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.) ...|$|R

He replaced the wheels on a [...] Holt steamer, No. 77, {{with a set of}} wooden <b>tracks</b> <b>bolted</b> to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island. Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it!" [...] Others reported that Holt got the name from British troops who witnessed a working prototype of Hornsby's track-type vehicle in July 1907. Continuous tracks allowed practical cultivation of the rich farmland on an industrial scale. The invention also allowed planters to reclaim thousands of acres of delta land previously unusable for farming.|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft {{processing}} presents unique {{problems for}} the design of ground support equipment. A telescoping tube system consists of a number of nested structural tubes that can be extended and retracted (telescoped) while supporting a load. A typical telescoping tube system provides lateral, torsional, and vertical support for an access platform. Several concepts for improved telescoping tubes were developed with emphasis placed on reliability, ease of maintenance, and cost effectiveness. The most promising prototype design utilizes adjustable rollers running on <b>tracks</b> <b>bolted</b> to the tube sections. A wire rope deployment system ensures that all tube sections are controlled during extension and retraction. Track shimming and roller adjustment allow for fabrication of a high precision tube assembly that does not require extensive machining or unusually large shop equipment. The use of rolling contact eliminates the contamination problems encountered with sliding tubes in previous designs. The prototype design is suitable for indoor or outdoor use. A prototype tube assembly was fabricated and tested for strength, stiffness, maintainability, and endurance...|$|R

After many attempts he discovered that one could negotiate steeper stretches of <b>track</b> by <b>bolting</b> a rack between the rails, which a toothed wheel or cog {{on the underside of the}} locomotive could engage. He built his first locomotive in 1862, and on 12 August 1863 France awarded him Patent No. 59625 for the invention.

40|$|Currently, most of {{railway track}} {{inspections}} are manually conducted by railroad track inspectors. Practically, {{it is not}} possible to inspect the thousand of miles of railway track by trained human inspector. This inspection takes too much time to inspect the defected railway track and then inform to the railway authority people. In this way it may lead to disaster. Hence to avoid delay and improve the accuracy, our propose system will automatically inspect the railway track by using vision based method and vibration based method. This method proposes continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks which prevent major disasters. Our proposed system will inspect the rail track component such as missing bolts, tie plates, anchors etc by using vision based method and simultaneously do the calibration of railway track by using vibration based method. The system provides real-time monitoring and structural condition for railway track using vision based method and calibration to search the fault location on the track. Inspections include detecting defects on <b>tracks,</b> missing <b>bolts,</b> anchor, tie plate and clips etc. In vision based method camera we will use to capture the images or videos.

A 12-foot sections of treadway <b>track</b> was <b>bolted</b> to the saddles. The treadway sections were put together on the spot unloaded for many truck. The sections were taken out {{to the end of the}} bridge in construction. The sections were connected together with large steel pins. The 17th was experienced with treadway bridges, but this was the largest one. To cross the Rhine would need 80 or 90 sections to complete the bridge. Moving the sections then pounding in the large pins was hard work. These bridge could carry a heavy load including a 66,800 pound M4 tanks. The floating pontoon was an 18-ton pressurized rubber bag. The saddle was the metal and plywood frame was placed on the float and supported the treadway tracks. To prefabricate the bridge the pontoon had to be inflated; the saddles had to be assembled and lashed to the top of the pontoon. On 30 March 1945 Company [...] "C", constructed a treadway bridge across the canal near Alvert. On 5 April 1945, the 17th Engr. Bn. constructed a 384 treadway across the Weser at Ohr, Germany.

In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, winning in 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a reaction time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon his own world record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s. Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0 m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished with a time of 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55±0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.|$|R
50|$|The roller-locked recoil {{operation}} {{functions as}} follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in <b>tracks</b> on the <b>bolt</b> head, are pushed outwards into matching {{tracks in the}} barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats {{as long as the}} trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is only capable of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire.
