5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> mint, and wheat <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} tradition {{holds that}} both disciples {{made the trip}} to Däq Island to further their knowledge. While Dədəq Wäldä Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Qəne, Täwanäy had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> an eagle and tried to fly away, they would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> pebbles and stone him. When he <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq Island.|$|R
