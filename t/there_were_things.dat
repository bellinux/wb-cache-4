500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I thought were great, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} was {{finished}} filming, the footage {{entered into a}} long period of editing. Series creator Chris Carter noted that the episode [...] "wasn't cutting together well and that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> that just didn't work." [...] Once the resultant footage was reworked into an acceptable episode, it was four minutes under time. In order to compensate for this, additional inserts of the Rube Goldberg Machine were filmed as well as a scene featuring Mulder and Scully discussing the episode's back-story. The latter, which was filmed several months after the rest of the episode, required Anderson to wear a wig because her hair style had substantially changed.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put {{everything}} you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up." [...] He expounded on the idea, saying that executive producer Frank Spotnitz and he decided [...] "it was probably time to go [...] it was strange to be writing these things knowing {{it was the last}} time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." [...] Spotnitz explained that Carter made the announcement in January so that [...] "we had time to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due." [...] Gish later said, [...] "I have a great respect for the elegant way in which they're closing the curtain". Actor Bruce Harwood, who played John Fitzgerald Byers on the show, called the finale the [...] "passing of a generation".|$|E

500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by {{combining}} a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears {{wanted to use the}} hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his [...] "kill movements." [...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket." [...] He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back. Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There [...] were things I thought were great, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} ninth season, the {{producers}} decided to drastically change the show. The {{style of the}} opening credits in [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been {{the same for the}} previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, [...] "The Truth", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up."

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ginsberg {{admitted}} {{later this}} sympathy for Solomon {{was connected to}} bottled-up guilt and sympathy for his mother's schizophrenia (she had been lobotomized), an issue he was {{not yet ready to}} address directly. In 2008, Peter Orlovsky told the co-directors of the 2010 film Howl that a short moonlit walk—during which Orlovsky sang a rendition of the Hank Williams song [...] "Howlin’ At the Moon"—may have been the encouragement for the title of Ginsberg’s poem. [...] "I never asked him, and he never offered," [...] Orlovsky told them, [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> he would pick up on and use in his verse form some way or another.

2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when you know so much happened that was so bad to so many people. But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Penner (of The Los Angeles Times) wrote: [...] "The great {{misconception}} about 'The Challenge!' {{was that}} it might actually serve as a legitimate proving ground for the sexes." [...] The sports writer went on {{to point out that}} <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> keeping this match from being seriously viewed as a legitimate challenge. [...] "First, it was a doubles match, not a one-on-one competition. The strategy is different in doubles, weaknesses can be more easily masked and stamina is not nearly so critical a factor." [...] The other point to be made: [...] "Riggs amounted to a 67-year-old ball-and-chain shackled to the ankle of Gerulaitis. Riggs couldn't serve, couldn't return serves, couldn't hit overheads with any amount of force. Older than the combined ages of Navratilova and Shriver, Riggs was painfully out of place in this match. Even John McEnroe, on his finest day, would be an underdog against Navratilova and Shriver if Riggs were his partner." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001, Cuccurullo {{was asked}} to leave the band so that the {{original}} members of Duran Duran could reunite. At first the split was amicable, hinging on a financial settlement which granted him compensation from the band's forthcoming reunion album (to which he was not expected to contribute). Two years later relations soured considerably during the reunited band's American tour {{when he was asked}} by management not to attend the Los Angeles show after the band had invited him (no reason was given), and he began confirming some of the rumors that had spread about the 2001 split. Cuccurullo claimed that he was fired from Duran Duran by letter because Rhodes and Le Bon feared his reaction, though he told Duran Duran biographer Steve Malins: [...] "I would never get aggressive in a situation like that. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> that had to be sorted out in a professional manner, so, that's what I did.". Cucurrullo remained on good terms with Rhodes however, and in 2013 they released an album containing material from their side project TV Mania.|$|E
2500|$|Although the March 2007 {{issue of}} Foreign Policy listed BJU {{as one of}} [...] "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites" [...] because of its past {{influence}} on American politics, BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a Newsweek reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, [...] "It would not be my choice." [...] Further, {{when asked if he}} felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, [...] "The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture." [...] In a 2005 Washington Post interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by [...] "some of the more vitriolic comments" [...] made by his predecessors.

2500|$|His first work as {{writer and}} {{director}} was Norberto's Deadline (2010), about a shy and unemployed salesman named Norberto who start to study acting to gain confidence on himself. As screenwriter, he had previously collaborated on the script for Daniel Burman's El nido vacío (2008). The film was filmed in Uruguay and produced by both countries from the Río de la Plata, [...] "The crew that I chose is my 'dream team'; it's the people I dreamed to work with, beyond nationality, and ended up being a very mixed team, a mixture from Uruguay and Argentina," [...] said Hendler. He had never studied filmmaking before, he says, [...] "Many times {{we begin with the}} assumption that the problem of film is on the technical knowledge, but the technical rules are the quickest to learn and the least you use. Experience in the use of certain resources is what gives you the possible solutions or shortcuts at the time of transporting to the screen what you imagined. The more knowledge you have, the easier you reach it, but 'the truths' about cinematic technique are the easiest to solve as a director. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I already knew how to do, and some others I didn't, and depend on what you're looking in each movie." [...] By 2003, Hendler had started writing an ensamble story called [...] "The Day Ends at 10," [...] he dismissed the story but the characters were kept for another ensemble film, [...] "The Move", which included a character named Norberto, a role that started to have more and more prominence, until the story finally became Norberto's Deadline.|$|E

[...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E
