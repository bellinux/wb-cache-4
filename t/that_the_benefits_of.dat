5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Travelogues of {{contemporary}} foreign travellers have provided useful {{information about the}} Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang had visited the court of PulakeshinII. At {{the time of this}} visit, as mentioned in the Aihole record, PulakeshinII had divided his empire into three Maharashtrakas or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day Karnataka, Maharashtra and coastal Konkan. Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor KhosrauII exchanged ambassadors with PulakeshinII.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|The red-throated loon breeds {{primarily}} in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on {{the eastern part of}} the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> larger size outweigh the limitations.|$|E

25|$|In {{defense of}} the ordinance, the city's court filings argued six key points, among them that their helmet law was {{constitutional}} and did not contradict the state traffic code.

40|$|AbstractSeveral studies {{demonstrated}} that active exploration {{as compared to}} passive observation {{of a variety of}} objects leads to improved performance concerning these actively studied objects later on. These results may be specifically due to an improvement in perceptual recognition but in principle they may also be due to a speeding up of responses to actively studied objects. Recently, however, it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> active exploration on perceptual recognition may be restricted to a specific class of (biologically relevant) stimuli. By employing measures derived from signal detection theory we were able to show in all our three experiments that active exploration of virtual 3 D objects leads to improved perceptual sensitivity in a subsequent test phase. The improvement with these objects means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> active exploration is not restricted to a specific class of biologically relevant stimuli. The results of our second experiment further demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> active exploration is even strong enough to fully compensate for the effect of perceptual degradation, thereby emphasizing the major impact of active exploration. In our third experiment, we explored <b>the</b> possibility <b>that</b> effects of active exploration might be due to major changes in attentional strategies rather than to the action-related aspect. Results revealed that an attentional requirement left the active–passive difference by and large intact supporting <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> advantage of active object exploration lies in the action itself...|$|R
