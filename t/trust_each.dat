The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised. Disputes began to emerge between those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated and the royalist faction.|$|E

They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky {{that she is not}} hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs {{out of the house and}} goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E

It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making small concessions to achieve an agreement. The {{degree to which the}} negotiating parties <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> other to implement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining whether negotiations are successful. In many cases, negotiation is not a zero-sum game, allowing for cooperation to improve the results of the negotiation.|$|E

500|$|Glen Morgan {{began writing}} the episode after he read a Science News article about men in Greenland who found a 250,000-year-old item encased in ice. The setting—an icy, remote {{research}} base overcome by an extraterrestrial creature—is {{similar to that}} of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There? and its two feature-film incarnations: The Thing from Another World (1951), directed by Christian Nyby and produced by Howard Hawks, and The Thing (1982), directed by John Carpenter. Chris Carter has cited them as the main inspirations for the episode. As in the novella and films, the characters cannot <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> other because they are uncertain if they are who they seem to be. Carter particularly enjoyed this aspect, because it pitted Mulder and Scully against each other and provided [...] "a new look on their characters early on in the series".|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} a sparse {{arrangement}} of strings and piano (with {{the addition of}} oboe and harp in one cut), intended to convey the sadness of the King's muteness, and then the growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist's struggle for control. Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. As the film progresses, growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads. The music rises to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, but Desplat {{argued that it was}} the real climax of the story—the point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> other. [...] "That is really rare", said Desplat, [...] "mostly you have love stories".|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} {{process for}} Kikuuiki was different {{to that of}} Shin-shiro, where each member worked alongside Yamaguchi in a two-person meeting, and later working on the songs together as a band. For Kikuuiki, Yamaguchi recorded each song's demo, then in a meeting the band would discuss the song's feel and emotions, listing everything on a white board. Yamaguchi would then leave the other four band members {{to work on the}} song together, while he worked on their next song. Afterwards, he would return to the studio and make suggestions on their progress on the first song. This meant that Yamaguchi had less input on Kikuuiki than on the band's previous albums, which made him feel more like the band's producer. The lessened input made Yamaguchi feel that he had come to <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> member's musical abilities much more than before. On previous albums, the members needed to compromise or give up on ideas that they had, however on Kikuuiki they found that they understood each other much better. This led to the members expressing themselves more, such as drummer Keiichi Ejima, who showcased his taste in rock music strongly in the sound he created for the album. Many songs were still being created when they were recording, unlike previous albums where songs were entirely finished before recording the final take. This meant that many spontaneous ideas were included on the album. An example of this was the band wanted to add a chorus, they collected together all the people who {{happened to be in the}} studio at the time, including their musical director. The spontaneous process led to the song [...] "Klee", written about the paintings of Swiss-German painter Paul Klee, to be recorded in a single take. Similarly, the song [...] "Coelacanth to Boku" [...] was inspired by the atmosphere of Yamaguchi's room as the album was being created. Instead of featuring repeating sounds on the album, Sakanaction decided to carefully consider how each sound-effect effected the song, and included very few repeating sounds.|$|E

500|$|Tensions between Tipu and the Nizam and the British {{were raised}} when, in 1788, the East India Company gained {{control over the}} Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, {{pursuant}} to an earlier agreement with the Nizam. [...] In exchange, the company agreed to station some of its troops with the Hyderabadi army. By 1789, tensions between Tipu and his neighbours and vassals to Mysore's west, including the Kingdom of Travancore, also rose noticeably. [...] Travancore, listed in the 1784 treaty as a British ally, acquired from the Dutch East India Company two forts located within the territory of Cochin, a Mysorean vassal state. [...] The Dutch had never paid tribute to anyone for these forts since gaining control of them, {{but the fact that}} they were within Cochin's bounds was sufficient for Tipu to dispute Travancore's claim. [...] He began massing troops at Coimbatore and making threatening gestures toward Dharma Raja of Travancore. [...] British authorities in Madras warned Tipu that acts of aggression against Travancore would be met with a British response, and Cornwallis began urging John Holland, the governor of Madras, to begin military preparations. [...] On 29 December 1789, Tipu attacked Travancore's defences. Hollond, however, was not a military man, and rather than acting with vigour, he temporised and attempted negotiation with Tipu. He was replaced in early 1790 by General William Medows, to whom Cornwallis gave the authority for a military campaign against Mysore. Cornwallis began negotiating with the Marathas and the Nizam for their support, since the British forces in India were significantly lacking in cavalry, one of Tipu's strengths. The Marathas and the Nizam both had significant cavalry forces, and they were interested in recovering territories lost to Mysore in earlier conflicts. [...] However, they were too weak to attack Mysore individually, and did not <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> other, so they preferred to wait until it was clear the British were committed to act against Mysore.|$|E
