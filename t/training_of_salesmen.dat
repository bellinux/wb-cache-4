40|$|Recently, nation-wide {{interests}} {{from both}} industrial and academic circles are centering 1 on Sales Promotion activities but, to our great regret, its concept and nature are very vague. Some of the economists on marketing have regarded Sales Promotion as marketing activity-itself but others {{have taken it}} as a mere policy to increase sales volume. Most of definitions on Sales Promotion are mainly based upon {{the definition of the}} American Marketing Association. Therein, (1) In a specific sense, it means those sales activities that supplement and coordinate both personal selling and advertising and help to make them more effective, such as displays, shows and expositions, demonstrations, and other casual selling efforts not in the routine. (2) In a general sense, sales promotion includes personal selling, advertising, and supplementary selling activities. In this definition, the meaning of Sales Promotion is very vague in general, {{and it is difficult to}} get real meaning. Stillmore, it may be questionable to say that efforts of Sales Promotion are same with those of sales increase. The meaning of "sales" in this article should not be regarded as one stage of selling only, but as same with marketing itself. We would like to stress that "sales promotion" could be the same with "marketing promotion" in their activities. We believe, we must clearly distinguish marketing promotion from personal selling or advertising, because marketing promotion is very broad in its activities. The main factors of marketing in relation to sales promotion are as follows: 1. Commodities (product planning, merchandising and stock control) 2. Marketing functions (<b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>salesmen</b> and advertising staffs, and price manipulation) 3. Marketing agencies (dealer helps, etc.) 4. Consumers (sampling, premium, testing, contest, consumer education, etc. ...|$|E

40|$|Companies that {{organize}} {{large scale}} {{training programs for}} technical salesmen often find that a certain proportion <b>of</b> these <b>salesmen</b> do not complete the program. Thus, {{at the completion of}} the program the company finds itself short of the required number <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>salesmen,</b> unless it has originally hired more technical salesmen than it requires. This note discuses a decision-theoretic approach to this problem of overhiring; that is, how many trainees should be hired in order to have the right number <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>salesmen</b> at completion <b>of</b> the <b>training</b> program and still minimize variable training costs. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} International Harvester {{run to the}} 1830s, when Cyrus Hall McCormick, an {{inventor}} from Virginia, finalized his version of a horse-drawn reaper, which he field-demonstrated throughout 1831, and for which he received a patent in 1834. Together with his brother Leander J. McCormick (1819-1900), McCormick moved to Chicago in 1847 and started the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company. The McCormick reaper sold well, partially {{as a result of}} savvy and innovative business practices. Their products came onto the market just as the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant market areas. He developed marketing and sales techniques, developing a vast network <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>salesmen</b> able to demonstrate operation of the machines in the field.|$|R
