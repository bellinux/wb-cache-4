5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Under Culverhouse, the Bucs {{were one}} of the NFL's more {{profitable}} teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players.

25|$|Currently, UT competes at the NCAA Division II {{level in}} the Sunshine State Conference (SSC). UT is among the top schools in the SSC in both championships and student-athletes named to the Commissioner's Honor Roll.

With national championships in 2006 and 2007, the Spartan baseball team became the first team in Div. II baseball to win consecutive titles since <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> previously in 1992 and 1993. The school's basketball teams have played in the on-campus Bob Martinez Sports Center since 1984.|$|E

25|$|ABC hardly showed any {{baseball}} games {{during the regular}} season in the 1980s and when <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> was only on either Monday or Thursday nights from the end of Sweeps Week in late May until the NFL preseason started {{in the first week of}} August - and then you wouldn't see them again until the playoffs. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into Monday Night Baseball.|$|E
25|$|Ramprakash {{completed}} his century {{on the third}} day, but only Rikki Clarke (35) could add more than 20 runs, and Surrey were bowled out for 248. Surrey had a two-run deficit to catch up with, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> mainly thanks to James Ormond. Ormond swung his way to seven for 63, helping Surrey {{on their way to}} victory. Ormond reduced Glamorgan to 15 for 2 by lunch and 87 for 7 in the 19th over. Glamorgan's last three partnerships added 86, but the target was still lower than Surrey's first-innings score, with 176. Surrey hit at nearly five runs an over as they approached their target and were 122 for 4 off 26 overs at close, Ramprakash on 49.|$|E
25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her old self returned once more, slams into the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog â€”and herselfâ€” over the side of the gorge.|$|E
