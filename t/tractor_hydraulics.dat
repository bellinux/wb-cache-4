5000|$|A larger 170/180 {{model was}} {{launched}} in the late 1960s with a much stronger and more powerful Ford 5000 skid but sales were limited and only around 60 units were sold and production ceased circa 1972. The Horndraulic '800' digger was first produced during {{the latter part of}} 1965 and received considerable acceptance on the market and a larger 900 was later produced. [...] This machine mounted on the rear of tractors. The 800 diggers used the <b>tractor</b> <b>hydraulics</b> to power the digger although a pump system powered by the tractor PTO was offered as an option.|$|E
40|$|ISO 11783 is a {{communication}} standard for agricultural and forest machines. This standard allows an implement to command specific functions of a tractor. Agricultural tractors can be equipped for silvicultural work forming small scale forest machine. It could cost-efficiently compete against common forest machines in some tasks. We {{have developed an}} ISO 11783 compliant forest crane connected to an agricultural tractor. The combination is designed {{to work as a}} test platform for an autonomous forest machine. The dynamics of the system have been studied using first and second-order models. Based on identification tests with no load on the crane, first-order model is sufficient for describing the motion of most of the cylinders. According to the identification results, small controls do not cause motion on the crane, and a non-linear model is required. Currently used hydraulics of agricultural tractors is not entirely adequate for controlling forest cranes. With more intelligent <b>tractor</b> <b>hydraulics,</b> the crane could be more controllable and energy-efficient. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} an almond end-row nut sweeper. The sweeper attached to the three-point hitch of a John Deere orchard tractor using a Category 2 hitch and was used to sweep nuts back into the orchard after they had been swept into windrows. This system worked by utilizing the <b>tractor</b> <b>hydraulics</b> to power an 18 inch diameter cylinder brush. Proper field testing of the implement could not be done during the academic year in which this project was constructed since this implement {{was designed to be}} used as part of the California almond harvest, which occurs from late August to early September. However, preliminary tests were conducted at the Cal Poly Feed Mill by staging a mock almond windrow using almond hulls, and sweeping them along the concrete floor with the implement. These tests indicated that with some minor modifications, the implement should perform as intended...|$|E

50|$|A {{stone picker}} has digging teeth, a {{conveyor}} system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth {{are at the}} leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower <b>tractors.</b> The <b>tractor's</b> <b>hydraulics</b> control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the tractor construction, namely with emissions of com-bustion engine, manual and hydromechanical transmissions and regulatory hydraulics. The {{first part of the}} bachelor thesis contains the introduction of engines, combustion engine's emissions, emission's regulations and standards and equipment for emission reduction. The second part describes hydromechanical transmissions and hydromecha-nical and <b>tractor</b> regulatory <b>hydraulics.</b> The third part contains the comparisons of group of tractors from 100 to 120 kW and the evaluation of particular groups...|$|R
