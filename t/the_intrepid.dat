In 1993, she participated in a humanitarian effort in Armenia, taking food and medical supplies to the war-torn region.|$|E
5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid</b> Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E

50|$|Les Intrépides (French for <b>The</b> <b>Intrepids),</b> is a France-Quebec TV {{series for}} children, {{released}} between 1993 and 1996, that ran for 52 episodes (about 30 minutes each).|$|R

5|$|On 24 December Brilliant and Coventry {{encountered}} {{their second}} privateer, the 24-gun Le Dragon. There {{was a brief}} exchange of fire in which four French sailors were killed and up to 12 wounded, against six wounded men aboard Coventry. After the outgunned French vessel struck her colours the British took her surviving 280 crew prisoner. On the following day a third French ship hove into view, <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid,</b> a 14-gun snow-rigged privateer. After a short chase she fell within range of Brilliants guns; the French fired first, wounding one British sailor. The responding broadside from Brilliant capsized Intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120. The survivors were taken prisoner aboard Brilliant and handed over to British authorities at Plymouth.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{originally}} {{called for}} Intrepid to be scrapped after decommissioning, but a campaign led by {{real estate developers}} Zachary and Larry Fisher and <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid</b> Museum Foundation saved the carrier and established it as a museum ship. In August 1982, the ship opened in New York City as <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid</b> Sea-Air-Space Museum. Four years later, Intrepid was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

25|$|Much {{was done}} in the design process to make the second {{generation}} LH sedans look more distinct from each other. The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the Dodge Intrepid and the new 1999 Chrysler 300M (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little sheetmetal with <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid</b> and 300M. The new Concorde's front end was underscored by a striking full-width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a bottom breather. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also helped set the Concorde apart from <b>the</b> <b>Intrepid</b> and 300M.|$|E
