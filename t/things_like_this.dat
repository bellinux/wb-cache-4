In casting Casey as Daniels, the producers wanted someone who was older than Henstridge, physically unlike De Caestecker, and [...] "doesn’t look like [...] type", to make it less clear that they would end up together.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Smith and 22 other classical musicians from the UK recorded a cover version of [...] "The Prayer", which was released for download on 14 March. The proceeds of the single went to the Disasters Emergency Committee. Smith said [...] "It's a real honour {{to be a part of}} something that is being done for the first time, and I hope that all music lovers get involved and help raise money for the campaign. I really hope that we can make a difference together to help the horrible situation that Haiti is in at the moment." [...] The group, dubbed [...] "Classical Band Aid", recorded the track at Metropolis Studios and were backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Each vocalist in the group performed their own solo lines, and the entire group came together for the finale. [...] "The Prayer" [...] was the first ever classical charity single; Smith noted that [...] "Pop singers do <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> a lot but it's unusual for classical singers to get involved so I've been really excited." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, {{and it seemed to}} have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E

500|$|Having {{originally}} {{released her}} version of [...] "The Prayer" [...] on Wonderland, Smith and 22 other classical musicians from the UK recorded {{a version of the}} song for charity {{in the aftermath of the}} 2010 Haiti earthquake. The proceeds of the single, which was released on 14 March 2010, went to the Disasters Emergency Committee.

500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager {{recalled}} {{with disgust}} that [...] "atrocities were committed by both sides" [...] {{and went on}} to recount going on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to [...] "strafe anything that moved." [...] During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay, [...] "If {{we are going to do}} <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side." [...] Yeager further noted, [...] "I’m certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another August {{controversy}} arose after Dick McAuliffe {{charged the}} mound and knocked down Chicago White Sox pitcher Tommy John. [...] American League president Joe Cronin initially imposed a $250 fine on McAuliffe, but subsequently modified the sanction {{to include a}} five-day penalty. [...] Smith was convinced that Cronin had been swayed by the White Sox, exchanged angry words with Cronin in a phone call, and publicly called Cronin [...] "a weak man" [...] who had been caught in [...] "a big lie." [...] When the Tigers won the World Series, Cronin sought to patch up his relationship with Smith, but Smith declined, saying, [...] "I don't get over <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> right away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1944 Journalists David Nasser and Jean Manzon made an unfriendly {{report of}} the Medium, which was {{published}} at [...] "O Cruzeiro" [...] Magazine. The Reporters pretended to be foreigners using false names {{in order to test}} whether Chico was a fraud; Later when Nasser and Manzon arrived home after the interview, they were surprised, as reported by Nasser in an interview with TV Cultura in 1980: [...] "From dawn, the Manzon called me and said, 'have you seen the book that Chico Xavier gave to us?'. I said no. 'So you see,' he said. I was in my library, I picked up the book and was written : 'To my brother David Nasser, Emmanuel'. He had made a similar dedication for Manzon. For <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> that I am very afraid to get involved in Spiritism issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E

2500|$|First Sergeant William L. Umbles was demoted on that day. The exact {{reasons are}} uncertain. Some said Nolan was displeased with him. It {{might have been}} that Umbles tried to {{convince}} Nolan to turn back. It {{may have been the}} last straw in Nolan's trust in the First Sergeant after the alcohol incident. The two men would be silent on the exact reason later. But many agreed Umbles was angry and his behavior would show [...] during [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] to come. The buffalo hunters came back to camp excited at finding a large trail of sign and Tafoya estimated 40 Comanche in the band near Rich Lake. Boots and saddles were called and the men made haste to get under way. Nolan had not immediately appointed another acting First Sergeant and in his excitement to be underway failed {{to make sure that all}} canteens were full. Normally, this is the First Sergeants duty, but it always is the responsibility of the commander to make sure <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> get done. [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] had begun.|$|E
2500|$|Kimmitt also {{acknowledged}} that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq. Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: [...] "We went into Iraq to stop <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage." [...] In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, who was party {{to some of the}} abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, [...] "We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening." [...] Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: [...] "The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [...] in his arm and took him away. This [...] was never processed and therefore never had a number." [...] Frederick implicated the Military Intelligence Corps as well, saying [...] "MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [...] that they were now getting positive results and information." ...|$|E
