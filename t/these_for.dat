5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to achieve {{geographic}} balance, nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice. Some states have been over-represented (although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed), with New York producing fifteen justices, Ohio producing ten, Massachusetts nine, Virginia eight, six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and five from Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey. A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included James Wilson, born in Fife, Scotland; James Iredell, born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson, born in County Antrim, Ireland. Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey). George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born Justice, {{and the only one}} of <b>these</b> <b>for</b> whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter, born in Vienna, Austria. The Constitution imposes no citizenship requirement on federal judges.|$|E

5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of <b>these</b> <b>for</b> any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends {{the extent to which a}} particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use <b>these</b> <b>for</b> a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E

He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E

5|$|On 26 January 1814, Edmund Kean debuted as Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice at London's Drury Lane theatre. William Hazlitt, drama {{critic for}} the Morning Chronicle since the {{previous}} September, was in the audience. He wrote a stunning review, followed by several others applauding (but sometimes censuring) Kean's performances in other Shakespearean tragedies, including King Richard II, King Richard III, Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and, what Hazlitt considered the best of Kean's performances, Othello. (These were written for the Morning Chronicle, the Champion, and the Examiner; he was to continue as principal drama {{critic for the}} last of <b>these</b> <b>for</b> three years.) Kean was hitherto unknown in London. Hazlitt, having recently begun {{a career as a}} theatrical reviewer, was no better known than the subject of his reviews. These notices quickly brought both Kean and Hazlitt before the public eye.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use <b>these</b> <b>for</b> his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using <b>these</b> <b>for</b> themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E

He has also won the most titles with the club, having won the league 16 times and the cup 5 times. With 151 league goals, Harald Martin Brattbakk is the club's all-time top scorer and was the league's top scorer during six seasons. Sigurd Rushfeldt is the league's all-time top scorer, {{although}} he scored a majority of <b>these</b> <b>for</b> Tromsø. Odd Iversen holds the record for most goals in a single match and season, with 6 and 30 respectively. The club received it highest transfer fee for John Carew; they received 75 million Norwegian krone when he was sold to Valencia in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles taped {{the main}} track, {{consisting}} of guitars, piano and drums, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. The session {{took place on}} 2 June 1966, the day after Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{for the first time}} and secured Shankar's agreement to help him master the sitar. The band recorded five takes of the song before Harrison selected the third of <b>these</b> <b>for</b> further work. After reduction to a single track on the four-track master tape, their performance consisted of Harrison on lead guitar, treated with a Leslie effect, McCartney on piano and Ringo Starr on drums, with Lennon adding tambourine. The group then overdubbed vocals, with McCartney and Lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside Harrison's lead vocal. Further overdubs included maracas, the sound of which Pollack likens to a rattlesnake; additional piano, at the end of the bridge sections and over the E79 chord in the verses; and handclaps.|$|E
