5|$|Through {{much of the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church {{had only}} a small number of {{cardinals}} at any one time, down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261) or Pope John XXI (1276-1277). Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. With a small electorate an individual vote was significant, and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines. Conclaves could last months and even years. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants, and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope. The cardinals disliked these strict rules of the conclave; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI's Licet felicis recordationis formally revoked them later that same year - both these Popes had intended to promulgate a new constitution governing papal elections, but died before doing so. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294, when a Benedictine hermit was elected as Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave, but soon resigned the papacy. Long interregna occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened until almost two years had passed; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.|$|E
5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Decree</b> #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean transition to democracy, the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E

25|$|The Alhambra Decree (also {{known as}} the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) {{ordering}} the expulsion of practicing Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon and its territories and possessions by 31 July, of that year. The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large converso population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism.

Both parties used, by analogy, the Benedictine rule, which stated {{that in the case of}} a double election for abbot, the valid election was the one made by [...] "the sounder part" [...] (sanior pars) of the electors – but there was no consensus which part of the College was [...] "sounder" [...] in this case.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the Muslims of Granada, {{who were}} under Muslim rule until 1492, Muslims {{in the rest}} of Castile had lived under Christian rule for generations. Following the {{conversions}} in Granada, Isabella decided to impose a conversion-or-expulsion decree against the Muslims.
