5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> doing paid work, and that a man's <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> doing paid work is more valuable than a man's <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> at depth).|$|E

5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> at each depth, the breathing rate of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E
50|$|Up to 85% of the lap <b>time</b> is <b>spent</b> on full throttle, meaning immense {{stress on}} engine and {{drivetrain}} components. However, the <b>times</b> <b>spent</b> reaching maximum speed also mean tremendous wear {{on the brakes}} and suspension as cars must slow from over 200 mph to around 65 mph for the sharp corner at the village of Mulsanne.|$|R

40|$|Starting on the {{original}} model proposed by Giddings and Eyring, the theory of chromatography is revised from a microscopic point of view. The migration of a molecule inside the chromatographic column {{is described as a}} sequence of random variables, viz. the <b>times</b> <b>spent</b> in stationary phase (adsorption) and the <b>times</b> <b>spent</b> in mobile phase (desorption). The fundamental parameters used to describe any chromatographic separation are obtained in the framework of the stochastic theory of chromatography. The effects of the surface heterogeneity and mass overloading on the peak shape are discussed. A link between linear and nonlinear chromatography is established...|$|R

5|$|Herbert Jefferis Pennock (February 10, 1894– January 30, 1948) was an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball from 1912 through 1933.

Although Kenyatta enjoyed life in London and feared arrest if he returned home, he arrived in Mombasa in September 1930. On his return, his prestige among the Kikuyu was high because of his <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E

Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} the dietary habits of the wildebeest, the animals were found to be feeding on the three {{dominant}} grasses of the area, namely : Themeda triandra, Digitaria macroblephara and Pennisetum mezianum.

Though the choice of diet remained the same in both the dry and the wet season, the animals were more selective during the latter.|$|E
