5|$|In 1879, after Stone {{organized}} a petition by suffragists across the state, Massachusetts women were given strictly delimited voting rights: {{a woman who}} could prove the same qualifications as a male voter was allowed to cast her vote for members of the school board. Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband's surname as her own. She refused, and never participated in <b>that</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Senator Boxer {{voted against}} the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq. She has subsequently referred to <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> as the best vote of her career.

25|$|In {{a runoff}} {{election}} held in December 1971, U.S. Representative Edwin Washington Edwards of Crowley in Acadia Parish defeated then state Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport {{for the party}} nomination. <b>That</b> <b>vote</b> was close: Edwards, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to Johnston's 579,774 (49.8 percent). Edwards then beat Republican David C. Treen in the state general election held on February 1, 1972. By that time, Davis' days as a politician were clearly behind him.|$|E
25|$|Only three {{candidates}} won majorities {{in the individual}} counties: Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, and Ron Paul. The Giuliani campaign followed an unusual strategy of focusing on larger states <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> later in the process, and had done little if any campaigning in Iowa. Tancredo had already withdrawn from the presidential race two weeks earlier and endorsed Romney, but his name remained in the official list of candidates of the Iowa Republican Party.|$|E

25|$|In the 2001 general election, Alliance {{proposed}} a pro-Good Friday Agreement {{pact with the}} Ulster Unionist Party {{in the hopes of}} getting UUP support in Belfast East. However the UUP did not agree and so both parties stood. Robinson was re-elected with 42.5% of the vote, with the UUP, Alliance and Progressive Unionist Party carving up the pro-Agreement pro-union vote between them, but it is doubtful that an unopposed Alliance candidate could have consolidated all of <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> to beat Robinson.|$|E
25|$|In {{the runoff}} election, Yanukovych officially {{won by a}} narrow margin, but Yushchenko and his {{supporters}} alleged <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> rigging and intimidation cost him many votes, especially in eastern Ukraine. A political crisis erupted after the opposition started massive street protests in Kiev and other cities, and the Supreme Court of Ukraine ordered the election results null and void. A second runoff found Viktor Yushchenko the winner. Five days later, Yanukovych resigned from office and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005.|$|E
25|$|The winning {{slate of}} electors meet at its state's capital {{on the first}} Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, to vote.

25|$|The {{price of}} land was the {{dominant}} election issue: The business strategy of the Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development that was necessary for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell {{on the other hand}} was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence there was a real possibility <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} February 8 some unions began {{to return to}} work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in {{reaction}} to the pressure of life under the general strike. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost <b>that</b> <b>vote.</b> Finally on February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the strike the next day. The original strike in the shipyards continued.|$|E
25|$|Under {{legislation}} passed in 1999, but subsequently superseded, VSM could be enacted at any New Zealand university by a referendum of students. Only {{students at the}} University of Auckland voted to enact VSM, affecting membership of the Auckland University Students' Association. Consequently, students enrolled since <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> go without membership in the student association unless they become aware of it, {{find out how to}} join, and afford the fees without the option of having it included in their student loan. Students at the University of Waikato enacted VSM, but later returned to universal student membership, when a referendum was held during study week.|$|E

Bârlădeanu remembered Kavtaradze telling {{him that he was}} present at the 17th Party Congress of 1934, where he claimed to have cast his vote in favor of Sergey Kirov and against Stalin's choices for the Central Committee. The ballot was secret, but Stalin later ordered the voting majority to be purged, which would have left Kavtaradze among the very few survivors of <b>that</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
25|$|At this time, the {{population}} of Mayotte voted against independence from France in two referenda. The first, held on 22 December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France, while the second, held in February 1976, confirmed <b>that</b> <b>vote</b> with an overwhelming 99.4%. The three remaining islands, ruled by President Soilih, instituted a number of socialist and isolationist policies that soon strained relations with France. On 13 May 1978, Bob Denard returned to overthrow President Soilih and reinstate Abdallah {{with the support of}} the French, Rhodesian and South African governments. During Soilih's brief rule, he faced seven additional coup attempts until he was finally forced from office and killed.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2010, another {{filibuster}} prevented {{debate on}} the Defense Authorization Act. In response to <b>that</b> <b>vote,</b> Senators Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins introduced a bill that included the policy-related portions of the Defense Authorization Act that they considered more likely to pass as a stand-alone bill. It passed the House on a vote of 250 to 175 on December 15, 2010. On December 18, 2010, the Senate voted to end debate on its {{version of the bill}} by a cloture vote of 63–33. The final Senate vote was held later that same day, with the measure passing by a vote of 65–31.|$|E

25|$|West Virginia was {{the only}} state in the Union to {{separate}} from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the American Civil War. In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted to secede from the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner (which ultimately became West Virginia), only voted 17 {{in favor of the}} Ordinance of Secession, and 30 voted against, with 2 abstentions. Almost immediately after <b>that</b> <b>vote,</b> a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861. When this First Wheeling Convention met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though {{more than one-third of the}} delegates were from the northern panhandle area, but soon there was a division of sentiment.|$|E
500|$|Scalia met no {{opposition}} from the committee.

Scalia took his seat on September 26, 1986.
