The designed equalizers remove the distortion caused by the channel from the transmitted signal without requiring any specific model or state-space information. The first approach is based on the a recursive Wiener filtering procedure and is designed using the Wiener-Hopf equation. On the other hand, the second approach uses the LMS algorithm and investigates the effect of different step sizes on the speed of the conversion and the accuracy of the overall algorithm. Simulation results are presented and both schemes are compared under different distortion levels and signal to noise ratio(SNR) values via impulse response, frequency response and ABER simulations.
