40|$|Film boiling heat {{transfer}} coefficients for a downward-facing hemispherical surface are measured from the quenching tests in DELTA (Downward-boiling Experimental Laminar <b>Transition</b> <b>Apparatus).</b> Two test sections are made of copper to maintain low Biot numbers. The outer diameters of the hemispheres are 120 mm and 294 mm, respectively. The thickness of all the test sections is 30 mm. The effect of diameter on film boiling {{heat transfer}} is quantified utilizing results obtained from the test sections. The measured data are compared with the numerical predictions from laminar film boiling analysis. The measured heat transfer coefficients {{are found to be}} greater than those predicted by the conventional laminar flow theory on account of the interfacial wavy motion incurred by the Helmholtz instability. Incorporation of the wavy motion model considerably improves the agreement between the experimental and numerical results in terms of heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the interfacial wavy motion and the quenching process are visualized through a digital camera...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an apparatus of {{differential thermal analysis}} (DTA) capable of simultaneous surface specific ultraviolet (UV) photoemission measurements to investigate thin-film phase <b>transitions.</b> The <b>apparatus</b> was installed in a vacuum chamber of 10 - 6 Torr range for thermal isolation and the measurements of UV photoemission. As a sample substrate, we used a thin (10 μm) copper sheet supported by two wires for optimal thermal resistivity. The performance of the apparatus was examined using a 650 -A-thick pentacontane (n-C 50 H 102) film, which may exhibit a unique monolayer phase transition known as surface freezing. We observed two anomalies of DTA curve around the bulk melting temperature, {{one of which is}} apparently due to the bulk melting. Since the temperature dependence of the surface specific UV photoemission measurements showed corresponding changes in photoemission current, we could conclude that the other phase transition peak originates from the surface freezing effect. This demonstrates that our DTA-UV apparatus is sufficiently sensitive to examine such monolayer phase transitions...|$|R

So, experiments performed on several materials, as those :for first wall and blanket, show that the scattering between data from FIMEC and from standard tensile test is reduced within the range +/- 0. 06; i. e. it is comparable with the scattering obtained in different tensile tests on the same material.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{feasibility}} of producing new short wavelength laser sources using inner-shell photoionization or shake-up excitation induced by laser-produced plasma pumping. Laser-produced plasmas effectively convert high energy laser pulses into incoherent light in the XUV and are suitable pumping sources for high energy <b>transitions.</b> An experimental <b>apparatus</b> was constructed appropriate for preliminary studies in both barium and helium. For barium, dye laser excitation of an appropriate target state was explored as an initial step towards efficient pumping of core-excited states of the barium ion. In helium, studies explored methods to reduce the resonant trapping of the He(II) ion which limits the ability to produce an inversion on the n = 4 → 2 transition and the n = 3 → 2 transition...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and technique {{have been devised}} for measuring the radiation pattern of a microwave patch antenna {{that is one of}} a number of identical units that have been fabricated in a planar array on a high-resistivity silicon wafer. The {{apparatus and}} technique are intended, more specifically, for application to such an antenna that includes a DC-controlled microelectromechanical system (MEMS) actuator for switching the antenna between two polarization states or between two resonance frequencies. Prior to the development of the present apparatus and technique, patch antennas on wafers were tested by techniques and equipment that are more suited to testing of conventional printed-circuit antennas. The techniques included sawing of the wafers to isolate individual antennas for testing. The equipment included custom-built test fixtures that included special signal launchers and transmission-line <b>transitions.</b> The present <b>apparatus</b> and technique eliminate the need for sawing wafers and for custom-built test fixtures, thereby making it possible to test antennas in less time and at less cost. Moreover, in a production setting, elimination of the premature sawing of wafers for testing reduces loss from breakage, thereby enhancing yield...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} {{studies of}} a variety of polar solutes containing rotatable groups and of some analogous rigid molecules dispersed in (i) an atactic polystyrene matrix, (ii) glassy o-terphenyl and polyphenyl ether have been carried out. Sample preparations and the dielectric measurements using General Radio 1615 -A and 1621 capacitance bridges with appropriate temperature-controllable cells have been described. The glass transition temperature measurements using the Glass <b>Transition</b> Temperature Measurement <b>Apparatus</b> have also been described. The experimental data as a function of frequency at different temperatures were subject to analysis by a series of computer programmes written in APL language. The activation energy barriers opposing the dielectric relaxation processes were obtained by the application of the Eyring rate equation. Different types of polar rigid molecules have been studied mainly to provide sources of relaxation data and activation parameters in the three media for comparison with those of flexible molecules of analogous size. The results of these rigid molecules have been used to obtain a correlation between enthalpy and entropy of activation; enthalpy of activation and volume needed for the reorientation of the rigid molecules. The activation parameters for the rigid molecules were found to depend {{on the nature of the}} solvent...|$|R
40|$|Peroxy {{radicals}} (HO 2, RO 2) {{are important}} intermediates in Earth's atmosphere. They are intermediates in the oxidation of alkanes and CO in combustion and atmospheric chemical processes. In earth's atmosphere, {{the rates of}} their self and cross reactions are often the dominant loss processes when NOx concentrations fall below tens of pptv. These reactions have proven difficult to study in laboratory experiments, due to complex secondary chemistry and ambiguities in radical detection. This thesis describes a new laser-photolysis apparatus to measure the rates of peroxy radical reactions under atmospheric conditions that employs simultaneous UV direct absorption and IR wavelength-modulation spectroscopy to detect the peroxy radicals. Prior kinetic measurements of gas-phase peroxy radical reactions have typically employed flash-photolysis methods coupled with detection of the radicals only by UV absorption spectroscopy. However, uncertainties can arise because several different species often contribute to the absorption signal. The IR channel provides an independent means of monitoring HO 2 radicals by detection of specific rovibrational <b>transitions.</b> With this <b>apparatus,</b> the rates of the reactions HO 2 + NO 2, HO 2 + CH 3 O 2, CH 3 O 2 + CH 3 O 2, and HO 2 + HO 2 were studied at temperatures from 219 K to 300 K. Our measurements have, in some cases, led to significant revision of previously accepted rate constants, mechanisms, or product yields, especially at conditions relevant to the upper atmosphere. The new rate coefficients for the HO 2 + HO 2 reaction are shown to account for a long-standing discrepancy in modeled vs. observed hydrogen peroxide in the stratosphere. A key finding has been the observation that many previous measurements of HO 2 reactions at low temperatures have suffered from problems due to complexation between HO 2 and methanol, a precursor used to generate HO 2. Direct kinetic evidence is presented {{for the formation of}} the HO 2 ?CH 3 OH complex; the rate coefficients, equilibrium constant, and enthalpy of reaction for HO 2 + CH 3 OH HO 2 ?CH 3 OH were measured. These results are the first direct study of the chaperone effect proposed to explain the enhancement of the observed rates of the HO 2 self-reaction by hydrogen-bonding species. The effects of methanol enhancement on the HO 2 + NO 2, HO 2 + CH 3 O 2, CH 3 O 2 + CH 3 O 2, and HO 2 + HO 2 reaction rates were measured. For the HO 2 + NO 2 reaction, overlapping, time-dependent signals in the UV due to the equilibrium between NO 2 and N 2 O 4 were observed that may not have been properly accounted for in previous measurements. Other studies of NO 2 reactions conducted at temperatures below 250 K may be subject to similar errors. In the CH 3 O 2 + CH 3 O 2 reaction, detection of HO 2 products has raised questions concerning the product yields and reaction mechanisms...|$|R
