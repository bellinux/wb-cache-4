5|$|Marshall and Warren's {{paper is}} {{accepted}} by <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> in May {{and published in}} June. Many reviewers dislike the paper.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by <b>The</b> <b>Lancet,</b> which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in <b>the</b> <b>Lancet</b> reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study also found that state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E

50|$|This window {{acknowledges}} the {{donations to the}} cathedral of the nobles Tréanna of the parish of Elliant. <b>The</b> first <b>lancet</b> features a kneeling Tréanna cavalier who is presented by his patron saint Saint Nicholas. In <b>the</b> second <b>lancet,</b> another cavalier is presented by Saint Derrien. Another cavalier appears in <b>the</b> third <b>lancet.</b> He appears to be from Bodigneau. <b>The</b> fourth <b>lancet</b> has a cavalier presented by Saint Hervé.|$|R
50|$|This {{window was}} {{restored}} by Lusson between 1869 and 1870. It has five <b>lancets,</b> <b>the</b> first showing John the Baptist with a noblewoman. <b>The</b> second <b>lancet</b> depicts Saint Christopher, the third depicts a kneeling canon although the saint presenting him {{has not been}} identified.

5|$|When {{traditional}} cutters are involved, non-sterile {{devices are}} likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails. According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in <b>The</b> <b>Lancet,</b> a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and {{overseer}} of {{the parish}} restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of the tower, and by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in <b>the</b> <b>lancet</b> window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E

50|$|It was {{restored}} by Lusson and has four <b>lancets.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>lancet</b> depicts Saint Paul, his hand {{resting on the}} hilt of a sword. He is presenting a kneeling canon from Pont-l'Abbé. In <b>the</b> second <b>lancet,</b> a young chevalier is on his knees being presented by John the Evangelist who holds a chalice alive with snakes. In <b>the</b> third <b>lancet,</b> a female benefactor kneels, presented by a female martyr, possibly Sainte Marguerite.

5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal <b>The</b> <b>Lancet,</b> and in medical textbooks.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera {{published}} {{the results of}} a nine-month investigation, which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat’s death suggested in several rumors could be true. Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of polonium in quantities much higher than could occur naturally on Arafat's personal belongings. On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and her case has been {{discussed}} in the leading British medical journal <b>The</b> <b>Lancet.</b> On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> five <b>lancet</b> Window 125 {{is known}} as the [...] "Verrière du Dresnay". In <b>the</b> first <b>lancet</b> is <b>the</b> figure of a bishop, thought by some experts to be Saint Pol Aurélien and by others to be Saint Paul. In <b>the</b> second <b>lancet,</b> Yves du Dresnay, the cathedral canon from 1486 to 1497 and a {{significant}} benefactor of it is shown kneeling and being presented by an unidentified female saint. In <b>the</b> third <b>lancet</b> is <b>the</b> blind Saint Hervé and his legendary wolf. The image of Hervé was completely remade in 1998. <b>The</b> fourth <b>lancet</b> depicts a second donor to the cathedral, a noble of the Dresnay family. He kneels before a prie-Dieu and is presented by Saint-Yves. <b>The</b> fifth <b>lancet</b> depicts another noble presented by a Holy bishop. The window's tracery includes the Dresnay arms.|$|R
2500|$|IBC {{illustrated}} {{several of}} what it calls [...] "the main data {{that are relevant to}} a comparative assessment of" [...] the ILCS study and <b>the</b> 2004 <b>Lancet</b> study. It points to, for example, a much larger number of clusters (2,200 for ILCS vs. 33 for Lancet), and a more accurate sampling rate (1 in 200 for ILCS vs. 1 in 3,000 for <b>Lancet).</b> <b>The</b> 2006 <b>Lancet</b> study is somewhat larger than the first (it used 47 clusters instead of 33, and had a lower sampling rate). <b>The</b> 2004 <b>Lancet</b> study surveyed 988 households, and <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Lancet</b> study surveyed 1849 households. The ILCS study surveyed 22,000 households.|$|R
5000|$|Another five lancet window, Window 126 {{is known}} as the [...] "Verrière de Kerguelenen". <b>The</b> first <b>lancet</b> depicts <b>the</b> Virgin Mary with child. The second {{features}} Canon of Kerguelenen being presented by Saint Julien. Kerguelenen was the canon of the cathedral from 1489 to 1497 and the archdeacon of Poher. <b>The</b> third <b>lancet</b> depicts Saint Christopher with a child on his back presenting a Kerguelenen nobleman and In <b>the</b> fourth <b>lancet,</b> Sainte Barbe is depicted holding her tower and presenting a kneeling noblewoman. A bishop is depicted in <b>the</b> fifth <b>lancet.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and <b>the</b> <b>Lancet</b> declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
5|$|Following Louisa's {{persistent}} claims {{regarding the}} divinity of Henry Prince, her mother enlisted medical aid and had Louisa certified insane and then placed her in Moorcroft House Asylum, Hillingdon. Her treatment and forced incarceration in the asylum has remained of interest {{with respect to}} the rights of psychiatric patients; Dr Arthur Stillwell, the presiding physician, made notes on Louisa's condition and treatment, recorded in <b>The</b> <b>Lancet.</b> Louisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square, but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. In 1860 Louisa's brother, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that Louisa had given him {{as a result of his}} undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860). The Nottidges won the case, with costs. After the cases were resolved Louisa Nottidge returned to Spaxton and spent the rest of her life as one of the Agapemonites.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place.|$|E
5|$|An earlier cathedral was located, between 1075 and 1228, on {{the hill}} top near the ancient fort at Old Sarum. In the early 13th century {{it was decided to}} move the {{location}} of the cathedral to the plain. The new building was designed in <b>the</b> <b>Lancet</b> Gothic style (otherwise known as Early English Gothic) by Elias of Dereham and Nicholas of Ely and begun in 1220, starting at the eastern end, and rising westward until by 1258 it was complete, except for the façade and central tower. The façade, huge cloister and polygonal chapter house were then constructed by Richard Mason and were completed by about 1280, the later work employing Geometric Decorated tracery in the openings of windows and arcades. It was about fifty years before the major undertaking of the tower and spire was commenced, the architect being Richard Farleigh and the details being rather more intricate and elaborate than the earlier work. The entire cathedral was complete by 1380, and the only subsequent inclusion of note has been the reinforcement of the arches of the tower when one of the piers developed a bend. This three-part building program spanning 160 years with a fifty-year gap in the middle is the shortest and least diverse and makes Salisbury by far the most homogenous of all the cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>Lancet</b> and U.N. pre-invasion mortality rates is 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. <b>The</b> <b>Lancet</b> study used {{the number of}} 26,112,353 (from Lancet supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million.|$|E
40|$|I survey much {{evidence}} on mortality in Iraq, including {{data from the}} first and second <b>Lancet</b> surveys. <b>The</b> second <b>Lancet</b> survey is inconsistent with all credible and relevant information on levels and trends in violent deaths and on the geographical distribution of violence. I discuss weaknesses in attempts made by The Bloomberg School of Public Health and authors of <b>the</b> second <b>Lancet</b> survey to claim corroboration for <b>the</b> second <b>Lancet</b> survey from other sources. These attempts notwithstanding, <b>the</b> second <b>Lancet</b> survey is a clear outlier within a wide body of evidence on mortality in Iraq. Iraq mortality, Lancet, Johns Hopkins,...|$|R
