5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Caracalla's death, Adventus was selected to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age.

Koufax later said, [...] "I had nothing at all." [...] He was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to Hall of Famer Willie Mays and Jim Davenport. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4–2 lead {{in the ninth inning}} of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.|$|E

He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic {{and there was a}} sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, a {{newspaper}} reported that [...] "the former invincible Cranston" [...] was not {{playing to the}} level he had in 1889 -- [...] "The old men, instead of improving with age, are rather deteriorating {{in the quality of}} their play." [...] The New York Tribune offered a more positive take on Cranston in November 1890:"John Cranston, the Crimson's center rusher, {{is one of the oldest}} and strongest men on either team. He has played four years on the Harvard team, becoming center rusher in his freshman year. He played a right guard in the two following years, but returned to his old place, because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to fill the old place. Cranston is aggressive and active and always gives his opponent a great deal of work." [...] The Springfield Republican wrote that Cranston was not a great blocker and [...] "is rather pugnacious and wastes time splitting heads; but he is a strong, heavy man, and will do his part very nearly as it ought to be done." [...] At the end of the 1890 season, Cranston was again selected for [...] on the College Football All-America Team, this time as the center. In 1891, The New York Times reported that Cranston had left Harvard:"Cranston is another man who will be missed. Year before last he played in the center but last year he was the left guard. Late in the Spring Cranston withdrew from college, and in all probability will not enter Harvard again. Although his game last year was not up to his usual standard, he was an extremely valuable man." ...|$|E
