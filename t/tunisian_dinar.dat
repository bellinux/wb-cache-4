3000|$|All these weaknesses, non-exclusive of others, {{should not}} hide the {{strengths}} of the Tunisian banking sector. In fact, Tunisian banks continue to maintain long-term relationships with their customers, who remain loyal to their banks, despite the emergence of new banking service providers. Customer deposits did not fall even during and after the popular revolution of January 2011. They were valued in 2015 at 59556.580 Million <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> 13 against 60, 905.717 Million <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> 14 for the credits granted; representing a coverage rate of 97.78 %. Tunisian Banks did not know the problem of the race of depositors to branch offices to withdraw their deposits. The risk of bank runs did not raise an issue for Tunisian banking sector, which has not suffered from global liquidity crisis. Tunisian banks invest heavily in new information and communication technologies. They can now follow their customers around the world without limiting themselves to national borders and without fear of time zones. The three main productivity ratios of Tunisian banks evolved positively even after the revolution. Customer loans compared to the number of employees increased from 2191.8 Thousand <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> in 2011 to 2617.5 Thousand <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> in 2015.

50|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} build four seawater desalination plants in Djerba, Kerkennah, Zaarat near Gabes and Sfax. The total installed capacity of the plants is 381,000 cubic meter/day {{at a cost of}} 620 million <b>Tunisian</b> <b>Dinar.</b> The capacity of the plants was increased by 50% in 2014 because groundwater availability was less than expected and water demand projections were higher than anticipated in studies conducted in 2006. The tenders for the 50,000 cubic meter/day plant in Djerba financed through a loan by German development bank KfW were opened in April 2014, with an option to increase capacity by another 25,000 cubic meter/day. It still remains to be decided if the large plants in Zaarat and Sfax, with a capacity of 100,000 and 200,000 cubic meter per day respectively, will be financed through loans or by the private sector through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts. According to SONEDED chief executive Hedi Belhaj desalination plants are desigend for peak demand during the two months summer season, while {{for the rest of the}} year demand is only a fraction of the installed capacity.|$|E

50|$|Tunisian {{political}} parties {{had the right}} to publish their own newspapers but those of the political opposition were only published intermittently. Faced with this situation, in 1991 the government issued a grant of 30,000 <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> to each of the parties. Other assistance was also provided to cover other expenses (paper, postage, and so on), but appeared to be granted under unclear criteria. In a decree amending the law in 1999 relating to public financing of {{political parties}}, the government allocated a grant of 120,000 dinars to political party publications and 30,000 dinars to other periodicals. These mechanisms constituted a pressure tactic that the government could use on newspapers that expressed too much criticism of the regime.|$|R

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{of the dynamics}} of the exchange rate at a long time remains a financial and economic research center. In our research we tried to study the relationship between the evolution of exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals. Our empirical study is based on a series of exchange rates for the <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinar</b> against three currencies of major trading partners (dollar, euro, yen) and fundamentals (the terms of trade, the inflation rate, the interest rate differential), of monthly data, from jan 2000 to dec- 2014, for the case of the Tunisia.

The estimated macroeconomic behaviour {{in response to the}} shocks identified with a Clarida and Gali–type structural VAR for Tunisia is generally in line with theoretical priors stemming from the Mundell-Fleming model. The structural decomposition shows that relative real demand and supply shocks account for most of the variations in real exchange rate changes during the estimation period and indicates that real disturbances explain about 80 % o...|$|E
40|$|Economical {{impacts of}} the use of olive cakes in animal {{nutrition}} in Tunisia. Despite its chemical, physical and nutritional properties, which are observed also in low quality forages, some researches indicate that olive cakes can substitute at relatively high rates some imported ingredients in the diet of rabbits and ruminants. Based on the results of previous researches, this simulation analysis shows that the introduction of olive cakes in the diet of animals in Tunisia is very beneficial for both the farmer and the government. The substitution of the concentrate or of one of its constituents by olive cakes, within an optimal rate of substitution, could offer farmers an income gain of 99 million <b>Tunisian</b> <b>Dinars</b> (TND) and foreign currency savings of 40 million €. The introduction of olive cakes in food blocks for sheep in scarcity period, as a partial substitute concentrated, could lead to higher incomes for farmers of 16. 5 million TND and foreign currency savings of 27 million €...|$|R
40|$|Competitiveness {{conditions}} of seed potato production in Tunisia. This work {{is an economic}} survey of the potato seed production in Tunisia from imported Elite class. Potato seed production in the studied regions ensures an average gross margin of 1717 <b>Tunisian</b> <b>Dinars</b> (TND) /ha and an average profit of 825 TND/ha for an average yield of 19 t/ha. Average production cost {{is estimated to be}} around 296 TND/t. The cost price of the produced seed after storage depends among others on the status of the stoker (Groupement Interprofessionnel des Légumes  GIL, or private), the selling price, storage cost and the crop season (rear season, primer or season). Storage cost is the main component of seed costs for the cropping season. Under present prices and production techniques, price of imported potato seeds is more competitive compared to that of the seeds produced in Tunisia for season crops whether it is for the case of a professional organism GILor for season and primer crop in the case of private producers. Privatisation of potato seed production is therefore not envisageable...|$|R

Recently, {{the quality of}} assets of the Tunisian banking sector has been enormously deteriorated. Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are steadily increasing from 11.3 % in 2011 to 14.5 % in 2015.6 This deterioration is mainly {{due to the lack}} of effective supervisory instruments and rigorous prudential regulation. The majority of all Tunisian banks are small, even compared to banks in African countries. Total assets of all banks is TND 74589.359 million. 7 Total equity is TND 6484.61 million <b>Tunisian</b> <b>dinars</b> 8 showing their low capitalization, as their capital adequacy ratio is 8.69 %. Furthermore, the structure of net banking income 9 shows the significant weight of the interest margin (which represented 54.7 % of net banking income in 2015) compared to the commission margin (which represented 22.5 %). Tunisian banks continue to rely on traditional balance sheet intermediation activities, despite reforms to encourage banks to develop market activities and provide more personalized services to customers. The Tunisian banking sector is also characterized by the deterioration of its exploitation coefficient. 10 In 2015, operating expenses accounted for 49.1 % 11 of net banking income. This high level of expenses is explained by the increase of staff costs, which rose from TND 811.4 million in 2011 to TND 1155.1 million in 2015.12 [...]...|$|R
