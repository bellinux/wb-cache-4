5|$|Beyond {{the ruins}} of old Phlan, the party enters <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> area—one of two quests {{immediately}} available to new parties. This quest requires the clearing of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, {{which can only be}} defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters' adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region. Eventually, the player learns that an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus, who has possessed an ancient dragon, {{is at the root of}} Phlan's problems. The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, 16 slums were {{identified}} in the town {{and a total of}} 34,029 people resided in the slums. <b>The</b> <b>slum</b> population increased from 42% to 47% during the period of 1991–2001. The high decadal growth of population during the 1961–71 period is attributed to the high level of industrialisation during the period. The density of population increased from 9,646 persons per km2 in 1991 to 10,613 persons per km2 in 2001. The wards along the Virudhunagar, Sattur, Srivilliputhur and Vembakottai corridors have registered increased commercial and residential activity.|$|E

5|$|The Great Plague {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people, and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> suburbs, untouched.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas.

25|$|Slum {{clearance}} {{became a}} priority policy in Europe between 1950–1970s, {{and one of}} the biggest state-led programs. In the UK, <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> clearance effort was bigger in scale than the formation of British Railways, the National Health Service and other state programs. UK Government data suggests the clearances that took place after 1955 demolished about 1.5 million slum properties, resettling about 15% of UK's population out of these properties. Similarly, after 1950, Denmark and others pursued parallel initiatives to clear slums and resettle <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> residents.|$|E
25|$|Due to lack {{of skills}} and {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the informal economy, inside <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> or in developed urban areas near <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b> This can sometimes be licit informal economy or illicit informal economy without working contract or any social security. Some of them are seeking jobs {{at the same time}} and some of those will eventually find jobs in formal economies after gaining some professional skills in informal sectors.|$|E
25|$|Slum {{relocation}} strategies rely on {{removing the}} slums and relocating <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> poor to free semi-rural peripheries of cities, sometimes in free housing. This strategy ignores several dimensions of a slum life. The strategy sees slum {{as merely a}} place where the poor lives. In reality, slums are often integrated with every aspect of a slum resident's life, including sources of employment, distance from work and social life. Slum relocation that displaces the poor from opportunities to earn a livelihood, generates economic insecurity in the poor. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> residents oppose relocation even if the replacement land and housing to the outskirts of cities is free and of better quality than their current house. Examples include Zone One Tondo Organization of Manila, Philippines and Abahlali baseMjondolo of Durban, South Africa. In other cases, such as Ennakhil slum relocation project in Morocco, systematic social mediation has worked. <b>The</b> <b>slum</b> residents have been convinced that their current location is a health hazard, prone to natural disaster, or that the alternative location is well connected to employment opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Informality of {{land tenure}} {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} of urban slums. At their start, slums are typically located in least desirable lands near the town or city, that are state owned or philanthropic trust owned or religious entity owned or have no clear land title. Some immigrants regard unoccupied land as land without owners and therefore occupy it. In some cases the local community or the government allots lands to people, which will later develop into slums and over which the dwellers don't have property rights. Informal land tenure also includes occupation of land belonging to someone else. According to Flood, 51 percent of slums are based on invasion to private land in sub-Saharan Africa, 39 percent in North Africa and West Asia, 10 percent in South Asia, 40 percent in East Asia, and 40 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In some cases, once <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> has many residents, the early residents form a social group, an informal association or a gang that controls newcomers, charges a fee {{for the right to}} live in the slums, and dictates where and how new homes get built within <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b> The newcomers, having paid for the right, feel they have commercial right to the home in that slum. <b>The</b> <b>slum</b> dwellings, built earlier or in later period as <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> grows, are constructed without checking land ownership rights or building codes, are not registered with the city, and often not recognized by the city or state governments.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, {{local and}} {{national}} government often refuse to recognize slums, because <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> are on disputed land, or because of the fear that quick official recognition will encourage more slum formation and seizure of land illegally. Recognizing and notifying slums often triggers a creation of property rights, and requires that the government provide public services and infrastructure to <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> residents. With poverty and informal economy, slums do not generate tax revenues {{for the government and}} therefore tend to get minimal or slow attention. In other cases, the narrow and haphazard layout of slum streets, houses and substandard shacks, along with persistent threat of crime and violence against infrastructure workers, makes it difficult to layout reliable, safe, cost effective and efficient infrastructure. In yet others, the demand far exceeds the government bureaucracy's ability to deliver.|$|E
25|$|Some {{city and}} state {{officials}} have simply sought to remove slums. This strategy for dealing with slums {{is rooted in the}} fact that slums typically start illegally on someone else's land property, and they are not recognized by the state. As <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> started by violating another's property rights, the residents have no legal claim to the land.|$|E

25|$|Some {{governments have}} begun to {{approach}} slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired {{in part by the}} theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind this approach is that if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> will not be destroyed and slum residents will not be evicted, then the residents will rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, {{they do not have to}} worry about the shanty housing. Squatters have shown great organizational skills in terms of land management and will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.|$|E
