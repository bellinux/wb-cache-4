5|$|On December 12, 2000, the Tiger-Cats {{announced}} that they had re-signed Akins. Due to the CFL's import ratio requirements, Hamilton Spectator reporter Steve Milton speculated that Akins would be cut before the regular season. Instead, Akins made the regular season roster and regularly started at wide receiver {{for the first time}} in his career. Due to Akins' speed, he was moved to the slotback position in August.

25|$|The {{addition}} of Arroyo and Miličić, plus {{the return of}} point guard Jameer Nelson from <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list,</b> sparked a resurgence of the Magic {{in the last quarter}} of the 2005–2006 season, as they finished with a 12–3 run, nearly reaching the playoffs. During this run, the team had an eight-game winning streak, beating top teams such as the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat and the Detroit Pistons. During the stretch run, Arroyo averaged 22.1 MPG, 10.8 PPG, 2.8 APG, and 2.2 RPG off the bench, which earned Arroyo the back-up point guard position behind Nelson. These averages were significant improvements from the statistics he accumulated with the Pistons, when he averaged only 12 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 21 points against the Phoenix Suns on March 3, 2006. On April 9, 2006, Arroyo injured his left hamstring and was sidelined for four games, returning on April 17 and scoring 17 points in the last game of the season.|$|E
25|$|In the Bullets' 1995–96 season Webber {{suffered}} a dislocated left shoulder in a preseason {{game against the}} Indiana Pacers on October 21, and opened the season on <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list.</b> He was activated on November 27, but strained his shoulder against the New York Knicks on December 29. After hoping the injury would get better with rest, Webber finally underwent surgery on Feb. 1 which sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. The Bullets were 9–6 with Webber in the lineup as he averaged a team-high 23.7 points plus 7.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.80 steals in 37.2 minutes per game when he was able to play. Other players injured included Mark Price (who only played in 7 games) and Robert Pack (31 games played out of 82). Bright spots of the season included the selection of Rasheed Wallace in the 1995 NBA draft and the All-Star play of Howard. Howard averaged a career-best 22.1 ppg and 8.1 rpg and kept the Bullets slim playoff hopes alive until the end of the season. Center Gheorghe Mureșan was named Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. The Bullets improved to 39–43 but just missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.|$|E

25|$|After a {{promising}} 13–6 start, the Magic {{began to fall}} apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings. Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused {{to play for the}} Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed on <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe {{he was going to be}} the team's head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season. He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill's return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection.|$|E
25|$|Given the team's recent {{offensive}} struggles, United fans {{might have}} thought they caught a break on the timing of a cross-country trip to face Seattle Sounders. The Sounders were playing without stars Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins, but United were soon without their starting forwards, in fairly short order, too. Once again, Luis Silva had to leave a game because of muscle injury, {{this time in the}} 5th minute. About 20 minutes later, the team was also down a man, after Espindola was shown a straight red card, for a retaliatory elbow. Despite conceding a man advantage, United held strong until a cannon shot Goal-of-the-Week game-winner off the foot of fullback Tyrone Mears in the 88th minute, against back-up netminder, Dykstra. Despite the loss, United remained atop the Supporters Shield standings, just 3 points ahead of the Sounders. United also had a two-week break to nurse a number of injured players to health in advance of a trip to Dallas. <b>The</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> included, Silva, Pontius, Franklin, Farfan and Hamid. The news was especially disappointing regarding Hamid, who was leading the league in several categories, despite battling a few injuries. It was announced that Hamid had undergone surgeries on his knee and hand, and would miss another 4–6 weeks. 2 days before the Dallas game, DC United also announced the trade of Luis Silva to Real Salt Lake in exchange for the Costa Rican striker Alvaro Saborio. While Saborio's addition seemed promising for a team desperate to find a goal-scorer, he could not yet join his new club, because Costa Rica was still involved in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. United's match against FC Dallas followed a troubling pattern that was becoming all-too familiar for United. Playing without the suspended Espindola in addition to all the missing, injured players, the DC side had little possession or attack, leaving the defense and goalie Andrew Dykstra under regular pressure. The United dam finally broke in the 73rd minute with a goal by Kellyn Acosta. United seemingly had managed to claim a draw and a point a few minutes later when Taylor Kemp's attempted cross to Arrieta was knocked into the Dallas net by an FC Dallas defender. However, once again, United's stout defense folded in the final minutes, allowing a stoppage-time winner by Fabian Castillo.|$|E
500|$|Twodays {{prior to}} the game, Las Vegas casinos favored Texas by 39points. Sportswriters John Bridges and Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman {{predicted}} the Longhorns would have a big lead {{early in the game}} and that true-freshman quarterback John Chiles would enter the game in the secondor thirdquarter as the back-up to Colt McCoy. [...] Redshirt freshman quarterback Sherrod Harris was on <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> and was not expected to play.

500|$|Throughout the 1991 season it {{was clear}} that the team's defense, which had led the league in points allowed in 1990, was declining. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when the team finished 26th in the league in points allowed. The Giants started 1-3 with Simms at the helm, rallied behind Hostetler to take four of their next five to get to 5-4, but lost their next five after Taylor and then Hostetler joined Simms on <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list.</b> [...] Six losses out of their last seven games meant a 6–10 record, their first double digit loss season since 1983. The team's pass rush, in particular, struggled after Taylor missed the last six games with a torn Achilles tendon. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, was fired after the end of the regular season.|$|E
500|$|After {{serving his}} {{suspension}} {{of the rest of}} the , Ron Artest returned to the Pacers at the beginning of the [...] After playing 16 games he demanded to be traded, and the Pacers put him on <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list.</b> The Pacers' Walsh said that Artest's demands were [...] "the last straw", and many Pacers players who had fought in the brawl to help their teammate felt betrayed. Jackson later said, [...] "I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [...] there was no 'thank you' or nothing." [...] After more than a month of inactivity, Indiana traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and finally made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings' 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year's stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being [...] "so young and egotistical", stating [...] "sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I'm on the Lakers, but I had a chance to win with you guys. I feel almost like a coward." [...] On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.|$|E
500|$|The 1999–2000 season {{would be}} Barkley's final {{year in the}} NBA. Initially, Barkley {{averaged}} 14.5 points on [...]477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game. Along with Shaquille O'Neal, Barkley was ejected from a November 10, 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal. Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely {{at the age of}} 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began. Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list,</b> and walked off the court to a standing ovation. He stated, [...] "I can't explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I've won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own."
