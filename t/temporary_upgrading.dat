50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the California {{softball}} program {{has been one of the}} more successful programs in the country, and earning a national seed on many different occasions in the past, the Bears hosted NCAA tournament games in 2012 for the first time since the 1993 season (the team then played at Strawberry Field). The main reason for this, is that Levine-Fricke Field is not considered up to NCAA standards because of its inability to host television crews and have night games. To remedy this problem in 2012, California brought in <b>temporary</b> <b>upgrades</b> to the facility for the Berkeley Regional and Super Regional. Because of the new Pac-12 Network, it is quite possible that California will have a more permanent solution to many of the venue's problems in the near future.|$|R

50|$|The {{buildings}} that are deemed of most significant historic importance {{are those that}} {{were built in the}} period 1929-39. This building phase was begun after the United States Army decided to <b>upgrade</b> <b>temporary</b> facilities dating from World War I, to provide more permanent facilities at the base. This resulted in the construction of a significant number of Georgian Revival buildings in a rough U shape around a central parade ground. These buildings included dormitory facilities for soldiers, administrative office space, and warehouse facilities. This area is also significant as the site from 1933 to 1937 of an encampment of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and for its association with Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers, without whose efforts the base might have been closed instead of being upgraded.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{explores the}} impact of mass higher {{education}} on high skills utilisation in the retailing, computer services and transport and communications industries. In all three industries graduates have been taken on in increasing numbers in recent years, partly {{in order to meet}} growing demands for analytical ability, generic skills and technical knowledge, and {{partly as a result of}} larger numbers of graduates applying for relatively low-paid, undemanding jobs. There is evidence of graduate substitution for non-graduates having contributed to a job upgrading process in two different ways during the last decade: (1) through a one-off permanent upgrading of clerical and administrative jobs in departments such as customer services and marketing; and (2) through <b>temporary</b> job <b>upgrading</b> as individual graduates in lower level jobs take on additional tasks and responsibilities in the hope of securing internal promotion or moving to better jobs with other employers. However, the scope for further job upgrading of a permanent kind appears to be limited. In general, the burden of adjustment to the increased supply of graduates falls to a greater extent on individual graduates than it does on employers. This contributes to a widening divergence of salaries and career prospects across the graduate labour market...|$|R
30|$|From a European {{cross-country}} perspective, {{the closest}} studies to ours are Arulampalam et al. (2004) and Bassanini et al. (2007) who use panel {{data from the}} European Community House Panel (waves 1995 – 2001) {{to deal with the}} effects of temporary and permanent contracts on OJT. Their focus is mostly on the extensive margin of OJT since the European Community House Panel has rather limited information on training duration and intensity. 4 In general, they find that temporary workers receive less training but the results are heterogeneous and not too precisely estimated. More recently, a comprehensive empirical analysis based on PIAAC has also been undertaken in the OECD Employment Outlook (OECD 2014), using pooled data for a large set of OECD countries. The main finding is that being on a temporary contract reduces the probability of receiving employer-sponsored training by 14 %. However, their interpretation of this negative effect relies on the fixed-term nature of temporary contracts, which reduces the returns to training, without considering the possibility that firms may have of retaining <b>temporary</b> workers by <b>upgrading</b> their contracts to permanent contracts, like in Spain.|$|R
30|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{and empirical}} strategy can {{be motivated by}} a search and matching model for a dual labor market {{in the spirit of}} Berton and Garibaldi (2012), who rationalize the co-existence of permanent and temporary workers in steady-state. A key assumption in their model is that workers under temporary contracts can be dismissed at will while those under permanent contracts can never be fired. The reason why both types of contract co-exist is twofold. On the one hand, from a labor demand perspective, firms face a trade-off between ex-ante speed of job filling rates (higher for permanent contracts) and ex-post flexibility of dismissal rates (higher for temporary contracts). On the other hand, from a labor supply perspective, workers are attracted by the higher job security given by permanent contracts but are exposed to a lower job filling rate when they search for them. As a result, the model features a natural sorting of firms and workers into permanent and temporary jobs, reproducing the main features of a dual labor market. After an adverse productivity shock, these authors show that firms are more likely to train workers under permanent contracts to return to higher productivity levels. Intuitively, if the costs of training are sufficiently large, the firm would always prefer to train a permanent worker who cannot be fired than a temporary worker who can be dismissed at will. Thus, an interesting issue is whether a similar result holds when allowing for limited severance pay for permanent workers and the possibility of <b>upgrading</b> <b>temporary</b> contracts to permanent contracts within the same job—as in Cahuc and Postel-Vinay (2002) and Bentolila et al. (2012). In the “Appendix” we present a model along these lines where it is shown that, for sufficiently low temp-to-perm conversion rates, a higher severance pay gap decreases OJT for temporary workers whereas it increases OJT for permanent workers. Hence, our main testable hypothesis is that increases in EPL gaps will lead to higher OJT gaps between permanent and temporary workers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} effects of migration by providing evidence on the returns to working experience from western Europe in eastern European labour markets. In particular, using the 2003 Youth Central and Eastern Eurobarometer dataset, we test the hypothesis that there are differential returns to foreign as opposed to domestic work experience. Our analysis combines the Mincer wage equation framework and the Roy model of migration. The latter suggests that migration responds to net expected benefits. Hence, return migration is endogenous with respect to differential returns to foreign working experience. To allow for selectivity on observable or unobservable characteristics, we estimate an endogenous switching model in two steps. This procedure combines probit estimates of propensities to work and to acquire foreign work expericence respectively, and OLS estimates of earnings equations for stayers and movers, with the inclusion of nonselection hazards obtained in the first step. The expected wage increase is the difference between post-return migrants' wages and wages under similar conditions in the absence of migration. For any individual, only one of these measures can be observed. We impute the respective counterfactuals from the separate wage regressions. Our analysis shows that movers and stayers are rewarded for different human capital characteristics. We find an average earnings premium for foreign work experience of around 30 %. This can be seen as partial evidence for international skill diffusion <b>temporary</b> migrants may <b>upgrade</b> their skills by learning on the job in countries with higher technological development, and subsequently bring human capital to their source country, thus adding to know-how diffusion and the catching-up of their economy. We perform additional empirical analyses to support this interpretation we show that the premium found for return migration does not primarily reward the language proficiencies of returning migrants, and we further provide indicative evidence that no earnings premium is obtained for work-related stays abroad in other central and eastern European transition countries. Central and Eastern Europe, return migration, wage premium, skill diffusion...|$|R
