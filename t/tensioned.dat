5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, <b>tensioned</b> by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber is a fiber material, so the <b>tension</b> {{must be kept}} {{constant}} in the placement process. The attitude of carbon fiber placement head will change with the change of a placement path. Focusing {{on the problem of}} <b>tension</b> fluctuation caused by the attitude of carbon fiber placement head, gravity balance characteristic of symmetrical objects is adopted to propose a <b>tension</b> control method for eliminating the <b>tension</b> fluctuation and <b>tension</b> measuring error caused by gravity. In this way, the <b>tension</b> is kept constant depending on <b>tension</b> feedback control. Mathematical model and theoretical analysis show that the <b>tension</b> control method with gravity balance can eliminate the gravity influence on <b>tension</b> and make the <b>tension</b> keep constant...|$|R

Only a few studies are about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during <b>tensioning</b> process. The theoretical model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani. The <b>tensioning</b> stresses obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined <b>tensioning</b> stresses [1]. The model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on finite element method and the <b>tensioning</b> stresses were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll <b>tensioning</b> of circular saw blades which allowed the investigation of various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R

Methods Twenty cadaveric specimens, comprising bovine tibia and tendon harvested from sheep, were used to simulate ACL reconstruction with a looped four-strand tendon graft. A proprietary <b>tensioning</b> device was used to <b>tension</b> the graft during tibial component fixation with graft <b>tension</b> recorded using load cells. The effects of the <b>tensioning</b> device at extreme angles, and in various locking states, was evaluated. Results Strand <b>tension</b> varied significantly when the <b>tensioning</b> device was held at extreme angles (p Conclusion An even distribution of <b>tension</b> among individual graft strands is obtained by maintaining the <b>tensioning</b> device in an unlocked state, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tibial tunnel. If the maintenance of equal strand <b>tension</b> during tibial fixation of grafts is important, close attention must be paid to positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> device in order to optimize the resultant graft <b>tension</b> and, by implication, the strength and stiffness of the graft and ultimately, surgical outcome. </p...|$|R

25|$|Slacklining {{refers to}} the act of walking or {{balancing}} along a suspended length of flat webbing that is <b>tensioned</b> between two anchors.

Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tension</b> and {{suspense}} {{are powerful}} emotional experiences {{that occur in}} a wide variety of contexts (e. g., in music, film, literature, and everyday life). The omnipresence of <b>tension</b> and suspense suggests that they build on very basic cognitive and affective mechanisms. However, the psychological underpinnings of <b>tension</b> experiences remain largely unexplained, and <b>tension</b> and suspense are rarely discussed from a general, domain-independent perspective. In this paper, we argue that <b>tension</b> experiences in different contexts (e. g., musical <b>tension</b> or suspense in a movie) build on the same underlying psychological processes. We discuss key components of <b>tension</b> experiences and propose a domain-independent model of <b>tension</b> and suspense.
