5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> rip off flesh.|$|E
5|$|Sponges have unspecialized {{cells that}} can {{transform}} into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges {{do not have}} nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> the ground.|$|E

5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>To</b> match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E

25|$|Horned lizards use a {{wide variety}} of means to avoid predation. Their {{coloration}} generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain still to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> cause them to appear more horned and larger, so that they are more difficult to swallow.|$|E
25|$|Most {{capacitors}} have numbers {{printed on}} <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> indicate their electrical characteristics. Larger capacitors like electrolytics usually display the actual capacitance {{together with the}} unit, for example, 220 μF. Smaller capacitors like ceramics, however, use a shorthand-notation consisting of three digits and a letter, where the digits indicate the capacitance in pF, calculated as XY × 10Z for digits XYZ, and the letter indicates the tolerance. Common tolerance indications are J, K, and M for ±5%, ±10%, and ±20%, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Skin: Their skin is darkly {{pigmented}} {{with short}} glossy hair, very loose and pliable. They can twitch it anywhere on <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> dislodge insects {{and have a}} whip like tail, which is deadly on insects. They sweat just like a horse.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Betula papyrifera and Alnus {{species and}} use parts of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> make sounds! They can create these sounds by shaking <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> drum and scrape their mouthparts, or drag {{specialised}} anal 'oars' against {{the surface of}} a leaf. Larvae build communal silk shelters and the sounds may attract other larva to the shelter.|$|R
25|$|They feed in {{the mornings}} and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs {{on both sides and}} using the weight of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> push the end of the plant down {{to the level of the}} mouth. Mothers also use this {{technique}} to make food edible for their calves. They drink for a minute or two at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.|$|E
25|$|Webspinners {{continually}} {{extend their}} galleries into new food sources, and expand their existing galleries {{as they grow}} in size. The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs {{back and forth over}} the substrate, and rotating <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains a number of individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a complex maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby. The size and complexity of the colony varies between species, and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.|$|E
25|$|The {{fireball}} {{rose above}} the houses and moved toward the nearby Glasgow–Carlisle A74 dual carriageway, scorching cars in the southbound lanes and leading motorists and local residents {{to believe that there}} had been a meltdown at the nearby Chapelcross nuclear power station.
