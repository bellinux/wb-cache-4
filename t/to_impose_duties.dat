The governor had one-half the proceeds for his own private use, as owner of the Rancocus, without which vessel nothing could have been done; while the state received the other moiety, in virtue of the labour of its citizens as well as in that of its right <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>duties</b> on imports and exports.

Thereafter, land carriers, warehouses, and freight forwarders would need P&I cover. This would inevitably lead to an increase in the scope and importance of P&I cover, and might diminish the prevalence of standard cargo insurance.|$|E

Also, the nature of the positive duties imposed by the right to have legislative and other measures taken to protect the environment, to realise the right to housing, the right to health care, food, water and social security, and the right to education, “would usually result in them not being applicable to private conduct.” The remaining rights in the Bill of Rights can, depending on the circumstances of a particular case, be applied directly horizontally, so as <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>duties</b> on private individuals to conform their conduct to the Bill of Rights.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tenure of}} the freeholders was {{protected}} by the royal courts. After the Black Death, labour was in demand and so it became difficult for the lords of manors <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>duties</b> on serfs. However their customary tenure continued and in the 16th century the royal courts also began to protect these customary tenants, who became known as copyholders. The name arises because the tenant was given {{a copy of the}} court's record of the fact as a title deed. During the 19th century manor courts were phased out. In 1925, copyhold tenure formally ended with the enactment of Law of Property Acts, 1922 and 1924, converting copyhold to fee simple. Although copyhold was abolished, the title of Lord of the Manor remains, and certain rights attached to it will also remain if registered under the Land Registration Act 2002, which Act ended manorial incidents unprotected by registration at HM Land Registry after October 2013. [...] The Land Registration Act 2002 does not affect the existence of unregistered lordships after October 2013, only the rights that would have previously been attached to the same.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the field}} of medicine, {{positive}} rights of patients often conflict with negative rights of physicians. In controversial areas such as abortion and assisted suicide, medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out {{as a result of}} conscience, a right granted by conscience clause statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled. [...] Such was the case of Janet Murdock, a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009. [...] This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist Wesley J. Smith and bioethicist Jacob M. Appel. [...] In discussing Baxter v. Montana, Appel has written: Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians - with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>duties</b> on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the course}} of the 1760s and 1770s, William Pitt the Elder, Sir William Pulteney, and George Grenville, amongst other {{prominent}} Britons and colonial Americans, such as Joseph Galloway, James Otis Jr., Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, the London Quaker Thomas Crowley, Royal Governors such as Thomas Pownall M.P., William Franklin, Sir Francis Bernard, and the Attorney-General of Quebec, Francis Maseres, debated and circulated plans for the creation of colonial seats in London, imperial union with Great Britain, or a federally representative British Parliament with powers of taxation that was to consist of American, West Indian, Irish and British Members of Parliament. Despite the fact that these ideas were considered and discussed seriously {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, it appears that neither the American Congress, nor the colonial Assemblies, nor the British Government in Westminster, at least prior to the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, officially proposed such constitutional developments. [...] It must be noted, however, that Governor Thomas Hutchinson apparently referred to a colonial representational proposal when he wrote that, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay...was the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>Duties</b> or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764...And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons...an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet...it was renounced...by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the next}} Parliament was summoned, the King demanded that Phelips (and {{a number of}} others) should not be {{returned}} but, although he had influence with the boroughs James could not intimidate the county freeholders and Phelips was elected for Somerset. He again demanded war with Spain, but came into no open collision with the court. He was re-elected MP for Somerset in 1625, the first Parliament of the new reign. He was the outstanding leader of the anti-Court party. In {{the first days of}} the session he supported an abortive motion for immediate adjournment, in order to defer the granting of supplies. A few days later he carried a motion that two subsidies only should be granted. On 5 July he wished the house to discuss the question of impositions, and rebutted the king's claim <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>duties</b> on merchandise at will. He also objected to the liberation of priests at the request of foreign ambassadors. In August, when parliament reassembled at Oxford, Phelips pursued his former policy. At Oxford he virtually assumed that unacknowledged leadership which was all that the traditions of Parliament at that time permitted. On 10 August, in a high strain of eloquence, he defined the position taken up by the commons, and laid down the lines on which the struggle was fought until the Long Parliament (Forster, Life of Eliot, i. 239-241). Next day parliament was dissolved. It was Phelips who placed the true issue of want of confidence before the House so that [...] "As far as the history of such an assembly {{can be summed up in}} the name of any single man, the history of the Parliament of 1625 is summed up in the name of Phelips" [...] (Gardiner).|$|E

5000|$|Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in Strictures {{upon the}} Declaration of the Congress {{of the recent}} Declaration of Independence, and {{particularly}} of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet Rights of the British Colonies and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the Sugar Act, and the first which ever took exception {{to the right of}} Parliament <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>Duties</b> or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and {{as soon as it was}} known to have its advocates here London, it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable." [...] Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that [...] "local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament". [...] The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778. [...] In that year [...] "the commissioners of the king of Great Britain," [...] known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of [...] "a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain".|$|E

At least the government bears a negative duty not to hinder food security and, arguably, a positive duty to help the hungry enjoy their right to food. An analysis of governmental duties vis-à-vis market actors shows that there are conflicting rights and interests at stake.

Moreover, producers have a liberty right to use their property the way they deem most efficient.

40|$|To {{increase}} efficiencies, clothing retailers often outsource {{the manufacturing}} of products to traders.

Secondly, the article examines how employers’ OHS duties for non-employees may create OHS duties for retailers to ensure outworkers’ safety. It appears that imposing OHS duties across several corporate relationships and across geographical locations may diminish the capacity of retailers to manage outworkers.
