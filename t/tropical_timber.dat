It grew rapidly due to the export activities as a port town. The port is important for palm oil, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, manila hemp and sago exports. In the mid-1930s, the export of <b>tropical</b> <b>timber</b> from Sandakan recorded a level of 180,000 cubic metres which made the town as the world's largest exporter of hardwood. Many Sandakan wood logs are now found in Beijing's Temple of Heaven. Sandakan also enjoyed modern developments such as telegraph service to London and paved streets before Hong Kong and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Shipbuilding {{business}} in Sibu {{started in the}} 1930s to supply wooden boats for river and coastal navigation. It flourished in 1970s and 1980s along with increase in exports of <b>tropical</b> <b>timber</b> from Sarawak. It later shifted its focus into steel boat building. Some of the vessels in demand are tug boats for towing logs, barges for carrying logs, anchor handlers, Offshore Support Vessels (OSV), ferries, and express boats for carrying passengers. Most of the boats built are of small and medium in size. There are a total of 40 shipyards in Sibu. A majority of the workers are welders. In 2003, 17 of the shipyards were relocated to Rantau Panjang Integrated Shipyard Shipbuilding Industrial Zone, Sibu. This included Yong Chin Kui, Far East, and TuongAik. The boats built in Sibu are often exported to neighbouring state of Sabah, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates. In the year 1991, a total of US$50 million was earned for shipbuilding {{business in}} Sibu. In 2011, Sibu ship exports stood at RM 525 million. Sibu is also the only city in Sarawak to possess a vehicle assembly plant. The plant is operated by N.B. Heavy Industries Sdn. Bhd., {{and it has been}} assembling Ankai, BeiBen, Golden Dragon, Huanghai Bus and JAC commercial vehicles since 2010.

40|$|Over {{the past}} century, New Zealanders have {{successfully}} established a national plantation forest estate, primarily comprised of fast-growing Pinus radiata. Initially designed {{to complement the}} indigenous forest harvest, commercial logging from indigenous forests has now almost entirely ceased. The plantation estate consequently promotes the conservation of native forest, meets {{a large proportion of}} the domestic market for forest products (estimated at NZ$ 2 billion including imports), and also generates over NZ$ 3. 5 billion of export revenue. New Zealand exporters tend to promote their wood and forest products as renewable and environmentally friendly. These themes are particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where New Zealand pine products are promoted as substitutes for <b>tropical</b> <b>timbers</b> obtained from non-sustainable sources. Due to international market requirements, many New Zealand producers have sought certification of their forests.

40|$|Traceability {{is defined}} {{according}} to ISO 9000 {{as the ability}} to retrieve the origin and use of an article or an activity through a registered method. Its implementation in the timber industry is delayed because of limits of classical identification systems with regard to the nature of timber and features of the manufacturing process. One hypothesis of tracing the source of timber and its products is by analysing in a global way the microbial communities of timber and linking this analysis statistically to its geographical origin. We proposed a very innovative tool of fungi ecology, the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), that was used to characterise the fungi flora of two <b>tropical</b> <b>timbers</b> species, teak and limbali from four countries: Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic and French Polynesia. The aim was to show if there was statistical relation between the fungal communities of the timbers and their geographical origins.

60|$|This New South Dock (it was its {{official}} name), round which my earlier professional memories are centred, {{belongs to the}} group of West India Docks, together with two smaller and much older basins called Import and Export respectively, both with the greatness of their trade departed from them already. Picturesque and clean as docks go, these twin basins spread side by side the dark lustre of their glassy water, sparely peopled by a few ships laid up on buoys or tucked far away from each other at the end of sheds in the corners of empty quays, where they seemed to slumber quietly remote, untouched by the bustle of men's affairs--in retreat rather than in captivity. They were quaint and sympathetic, those two homely basins, unfurnished and silent, with no aggressive display of cranes, no apparatus of hurry and work on their narrow shores. No railway-lines cumbered them. The knots of labourers trooping in clumsily round the corners of cargo-sheds to eat their food in peace out of red cotton handkerchiefs had the air of picnicking by the side of a lonely mountain pool. They were restful (and I should say very unprofitable), those basins, where the chief officer of one of the ships involved in the harassing, strenuous, noisy activity of the New South Dock only a few yards away could escape in the dinner-hour to stroll, unhampered by men and affairs, meditating (if he chose) on the vanity of all things human. At one time they must have been full of good old slow West Indiamen of the square-stern type, that took their captivity, one imagines, as stolidly as they had faced the buffeting of the waves with their blunt, honest bows, and disgorged sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, or logwood sedately with their own winch and tackle. But when I knew them, of exports there was never a sign that one could detect; and all the imports I have ever seen were some rare cargoes of <b>tropical</b> <b>timber,</b> enormous baulks roughed out of iron trunks grown in the woods about the Gulf of Mexico. They lay piled up in stacks of mighty boles, {{and it was hard to}} believe that all this mass of dead and stripped trees had come out of the flanks of a slender, innocent-looking little barque with, as likely as not, a homely woman's name--Ellen this or Annie that--upon her fine bows. But this is generally the case with a discharged cargo. Once spread at large over the quay, it looks the most impossible bulk to have all come there out of that ship along-side.|$|E

This chronology was compared with time-series of local precipitation, resulting in a significant correlation with {{the second half of the}} rainy season (September–November). This seasonal precipitation was related with sea surface temperatures of the West Indian Ocean. Higher precipitation during El Niño years corresponded with higher tree-ring indices but differences were not significant. In addition, pointer years were rare and did not have a consistent link with extreme climatic conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role and}} use of portable sawmills in north Queensland. Using a semi-structured questionnaire and personal interviews, the opinions of 18 operators of portable and fixed-site sawmills were canvassed {{on a number of}} issues including main problems faced by the local industry, current sources of timber, sawn timber recovery rates of their operations, willingness to purchase new milling and other equipment, opinions about why (or if) portable sawmills can sell timber at a lower cost than fixed-site mills, and destinations of sawn timber milled. The most critical issues faced by sawmillers were the lack of resource security and competing products, in particular competition from imported <b>tropical</b> <b>timbers</b> from neighbouring island countries including Papua New Guinea. Most sawmillers in north Queensland currently obtain logs mainly from private landholdings and are hesitant to invest in new equipment due to concerns about future log supplies. This paper also explores the current and potential role of portable sawmills in the regional small-scale forestry industry. An examination of policy issues suggests that there may be a need for new legislation to cover employees, sawn timber consumers and sawmillers themselves. The future role of portable sawmills may require a co-operative approach that emphasizes low volume value-adding, due to the decreasing supply of logs i...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>timbers</b> can be {{produced}} from natural forests by selection logging with or without silvicultural treatment and enrichment planting, from mixed or monospecific plantations of indigenous trees, or from exotic monocultures. Other options include uneven-aged plantations and agroforestry. These options offer different yields, risks, environmental impacts and habitat quality. Which option {{should be used for}} timber production? Fast growing plantations on previously cleared and/or degraded land are rarely feasible, due to the distribution and price of such land. Landholders should be encouraged to rehabilitate land themselves, to establish wood lots and to practise agroforestry. The best strategy for the survival of the rainforest, its fauna and flora, may be to increase the value of the harvest of timber and non-wood products, thus making-the forest more valuable and worthy of conservation in the eyes of local communities. Simple logging bans are rarely effective. Timber harvesting alone is not a solution; other forest products can be harvested annually to provide a substantial source of revenue. Urgent research needs in many countries include vegetation mapping to identify communities under threat, and the rehabilitation of logged forests. Many countries lack the silvicultural and management skills to ensure that logging does not lead to degradation; appropriat...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{being treated}} with preservatives, the service life of {{transmission}} poles and fence {{posts in the}} Zambian Copperbelt province is close to fifteen years. However, the service life is only two years for untreated timber, mainly due to termite damage. This short service life is exerting more pressure on an already over-burdened timber resource base. This study used an accelerated field test investigation to facilitate initial assessment of several lesser known indigenous timbers for their termite resistance properties. To determine the service life and natural durability of Eucalyptus grandis and Bobgunnia madagascariensis to termite attack, samples of each wood species were field exposed to an aggressive species of subterranean termites for 32 days. Morphological and genetic analyses confirmed that the aggressive species of termites {{in this study was}} Coptotermes formosanus, commonly referred to as Formosan subterranean termites. Results indicated that E. grandis can be labeled as susceptible (S) following the standard natural durability rating procedure on the basis of service life projected from short term field exposure weight loss determination. Using short duration exposure weight loss and visual designation, similar to the Gulfport scale, B. madagascariensis was designated as very durable (D).
