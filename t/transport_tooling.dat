40|$|Remote {{handling}} operation {{has been carried}} out on the Joint European Torus for over 16 years with in excess of over 21, 500 hours of in-vessel remote handling activities. During this period the operations team has developed to provide the unique skills required to achieve the demanding remote operational campaigns undertaken today. This paper describes the challenges experienced in recruiting, training and retaining the remote handling system operators and examines the evolution of the team profiles currently used. The operations team have a number of key skills that vary depending {{on the role of the}} team member. A degree of overlap in skills is essential to ensure that operations can continue with the temporary loss of an operator. The remote handling system at JET utilises two Articulated Booms. A 12. 5 metre boom is fitted with a force reflecting servo manipulator (MASCOT) and a 9. 4 metre boom is used to <b>transport</b> <b>tooling</b> and components to and from the work area. MASCOT is a two armed master slave system; each arm has 7 degrees of freedom with the capability to carry a mass of up to 20 kg. The content of this paper documents the development of the JET remote operations team over the past 16 years, and should provide a resource of value for future tokamak remote {{handling operation}}s such as ITER and DEMO...|$|E

40|$|Roll-front type uranium {{deposits}} are {{a category}} of sedimentary uranium deposits of great economic interest. A correct representation of these geometrically complex deposits is fundamental for a rationalized exploitation. We propose here {{an alternative to the}} geostatistical approaches: the genetic simulation of the deposit, using reactive <b>transport</b> <b>tools.</b> The simulations should represent the chemical processes that lead to the formation of the mineral deposit, coupled with complex paleoflow in heterogeneous sandstone aquifers. To mimic complex flows in an aquifer hydrodynamically equivalent to the target aquifer, a geostatistical permeability model was used. A geochemical model was also elaborated: it represents a reduced aquifer, rich in pyrite and organic matter, and its reaction with oxidizing water. Several simplifying assumptions were made, and the competition between kinetics and hydrodynamics has been carefully monitored. Reactive transport 2 -D simulations were then performed with the code HYTEC, using several random realizations for the permeability distribution. The results show the formation of a redox front, progressing through the aquifer, where uranium accumulates. Due to the local variations in the permeability field, the flow distribution is heterogeneous, which leads to locally variable front velocities. As a result, the front displays complex structures. Some loops are observed, with deviated directions from the mean flow direction; also, gaps are observed over the mineralized front. These characteristics are well known in natural rollfronts. The study demonstrates the possibility to develop genetic simulations based on reactive <b>transport</b> <b>tools</b> for roll-front type deposits. They could ultimately lead to wider applications with predictive potential for characteristic values for the shape of the front or the mass of uranium in the deposit. The data required to calibrate the simulations are easily available (geochemistry and permeability of the aquifer, not necessarily in the roll itself) ...|$|R

We apply this to study Lyman opacity effects on population kinetics and hydrogen divertor radiation losses...|$|R

In the same way, <b>tool</b> <b>transport</b> in our close relatives, non-human primates, {{has been seen as}} an important indicator of material selection proclivities, and as a contributing factor to the formation of activity sites as part of niche construction processes. Non-human primate transport behaviour also assists in framing evolutionary scenarios for the emergence of stone tool use in the hominin lineage. Here, we present thefirst study of directly observed stone <b>tool</b> <b>transport</b> in wild and unhabituated Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea) in Thailand. These macaques were observed during intertidal foraging activities, during which they pound open hard-shelled molluscs with stone tools. We recorded 2449 transport bouts, when a long-tailed macaque carried a stone tool from one prey target to the next, and found that on average the same tool was used to sequentially consume nine prey items in each foraging episode. The maximum number of prey items consumed in a single episode was 63. We found that tools used to open sessile oysters typically were used to consume more prey per episode than those employed on motile prey, and females <b>transported</b> <b>tools</b> further than males. Heavier tools (N 200 g) were rarely transported more than a few metres, but the longest transport distance was over 87 m. Importantly for primate archaeological analysis of macaque tool use sites, we found that the median transport distance was 0. 5 m, meaning that tools are very often used in the immediate vicinity of the place they were collected by a macaque...|$|R
