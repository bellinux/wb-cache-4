5|$|In 1967, {{and again}} in 1970, Wilton {{recommended}} {{the creation of a}} single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>Defence</b> Minister, <b>the</b> <b>Defence</b> Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time, Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of <b>the</b> <b>Defence</b> Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the Liberals in the December 1972 Federal election. The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Defence</b> Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.|$|E

50|$|The {{tactical}} level {{relied heavily on}} fortified and static defences composed of infantry and artillery. Anti-tank guns were mounted throughout the entire depth of <b>the</b> <b>defences.</b> Few tanks were committed to the tactical zones {{and the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>defences</b> would have robbed them of mobility. Instead, {{only a small number of}} tanks and self-propelled artillery were used to give <b>the</b> <b>defences</b> some mobility. They were distributed in penny packets to enable localised counterattacks. Such tactics slowed the Germans, forcing them to expend strength and munitions on combating the Soviet forward zones. The Soviets had counted on the Germans being stopped within the tactical zones. To ensure that this occurred, they distributed large numbers of anti-AFV (armoured fighting vehicle) and anti-personnel mines to <b>the</b> <b>defences.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined <b>the</b> <b>defence</b> by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that <b>the</b> <b>defence</b> had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Because of its coastal location, {{the economy}} of Plymouth has {{traditionally}} been , in particular <b>the</b> <b>defence</b> sector with over 12,000 people employed and approximately 7,500 in the armed forces.

During the 1930s, it was the most widely distributed gin and has a controlled term of origin. Since the 1980s, employment in <b>the</b> <b>defence</b> sector has decreased substantially and the public sector is now prominent particularly in administration, health, education, medicine and engineering.|$|E
