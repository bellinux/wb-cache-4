In each experiment, the cells are exposed to a dilution series of 17β-estradiol (0.1 pM-1000 pM) for providing a positive control (standard dose-response curve), and treated only with hormone-free medium as a negative control. The bioassay ends on day 6 (late exponential phase) by removing the media from the wells and fixing the cells with trichloroacetic acid. After incubation (30 min; 4 °C) the trichloroacetic acid is removed by washing the plates under a gentle stream of cold water. After drying the plates at 40 °C the cell protein is stained with sulforhodamine B (SRB).

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Kusakabe, H.; Yanagimachi, R.; Kamiguchi, Y., Mouse and human spermatozoa can be freeze-dried without damaging their chromosomes, Human Reproduction 23 (2), FEB 2008, pp. 233 - 239, is available online at: [URL] authorBACKGROUND: Although mouse spermatozoa can be freeze-dried without losing their reproductive capacity, the technique needs further improvements to {{reduce the incidence of}} chromosomal damages to spermatozoa. Effects of freeze-drying on human spermatozoa are unknown. METHODS: Mouse spermatozoa were suspended in a <b>Tris-buffered</b> EGTA solution briefly (about 10 min at 37 ℃) or for 1 - 7 days at 4 ℃ before freeze-drying. Freeze-dried spermatozoa were maintained for up to 1 year at 4 ℃ before injection. Sperm chromosomes were examined during the first mitosis (cleavage) of zygotes. Sperm’s ability to support embryo development was assessed by examining mid-gestation fetuses after transfer of 2 -cell embryos to surrogate mothers. Chromosome integrity of freeze-dried human spermatozoa was examined by injecting individual spermatozoa into mouse oocytes which were previously enucleated. RESULTS: When mouse spermatozoa were freeze-dried immediately after suspension in <b>Tris-buffered</b> EGTA solution, only about 40 % had normal chromosomes. When the spermatozoa were kept in the same solution for 3 - 7 days before freeze-drying, 85 - 95 % had normal chromosomes {{and they were able to}} support embryo development better than those which were in the solution briefly. Freeze-dried human spermatozoa well maintained their chromosomes regardless of the duration of pre-freeze-drying incubation of spermatozoa in the <b>Tris-buffered</b> EGTA solution. CONCLUSIONS: Prior incubation of mouse spermatozoa in <b>Tris-buffered</b> EGTA solution for several days makes sperm chromosomes more resistant to freeze-drying. As the consequence, spermatozoa freeze-dried this way support embryo development better than those exposed to <b>Tris-buffered</b> EGTA solution only briefly.
