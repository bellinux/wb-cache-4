After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> with all my heart and soul for what you have done.

Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
