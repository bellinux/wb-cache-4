Three different block lengths of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments were used, namely PEG- 200, PEG- 2000 and PEG- 3400, where the numbers indicate the molecular weight of the PEG in g mol− 1. The HSPU were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and tensile <b>testing.</b> <b>Mass</b> transfer properties were measured by sorption and water vapour flux (WVF) measurements. The control sample polyurethanes without PEG and a sample with PEG- 200 showed amorphous structure and an unclear phase separation as detected by WAXD, DSC and DMTA.

The percentage crystallinity of soft segments was the highest with PEG- 2000 and an increase of PEG block length to 3400 g mol− 1 resulted in a decrease in crystallinity. Mechanically, polyurethane without PEG is tough while percentage strain at maximum load increased with increasing block length of PEG. In addition, sorption and WVF increased linearly with increasing PEG block length and with temperature.

40|$|Kinematic {{fracture}} porosity {{is an important}} hydrologic transport parameter for predicting the potential of rapid contaminant migration through fractured rock. The transport velocity of a solute moving within a fracture network is inversely related to the {{fracture porosity}}. Since fracture porosity is often one or two orders of magnitude smaller than matrix porosity, and fracture permeability is often orders of magnitude greater than matrix permeability, solutes may travel significantly faster in the fracture network than in the surrounding matrix. This dissertation introduces a new methodology for conducting gas tracer tests using a field portable mass spectrometer along with analytical tools for estimating fracture porosity using the measured tracer concentration breakthrough curves. Field experiments were conducted at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, consisting of air-permeability transient testing and gas-tracer-transport tests. The experiments were conducted from boreholes drilled within an underground tunnel {{as part of an}} investigation of rock mass hydrological behavior. Air-permeability pressure transients, recorded during constant mass flux injections, have been analyzed using a numerical inversion procedure to identify fracture permeability and porosity.

The ST 7 Disturbance Reduction System is designed to maintain the spacecraft s position with respect to a free-floating <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> to less than 10 nm/the square root of Hz over the frequency range of 1 to 30 mHz.

40|$|Quantitative data is an {{excellent}} resource in any proteomics study but is essential in many. In recent years this area has expanded from relative to absolute quantification {{with a wide range}} of methods available for absolute quantitative proteomics. In general protein quantification is based on either label-mediated or label-free strategies. Common label-mediated approaches are isotope dilution strategies, such as AQUA, coupled with mass spectrometry, where analyte signal is compared to a stable isotope labelled standard added in known abundance. These methods are suited to small-scale studies but increasing demand for large-scale proteome quantification exposed the need for alternative quantification methodologies. The QconCAT technology, first published in 2005, is a label mediated approach which utilises the principle of surrogacy to quantify analyte proteins based on a signature peptide, or peptides, for each protein. QconCATs are concatenations of quantotypic peptides for a group of proteins, the QconCAT gene is designed in silico and expressed heterologously in E. coli with [13 C 6]arg and [13 C 6]lys to elicit a stable isotope labelled multiplexed absolute quantification standard. In this thesis I describe several developments to the QconCAT production protocol. These developments reduce the production time from ~ 19 d, using the initial method, to less than 7 d. Time gains have been made across the whole workflow in the areas of protein expression, cell lysis, and product purification. Moreover verification of the QconCAT is delayed until the final product is synthesised, made possible by evidence of high quality reproducible expression. I explain how these alterations allow for production of several QconCATs in parallel, giving added efficiency. The success of the method is demonstrated through the use of multiple QconCATs. As a result of this work it is now possible to make at least eight QconCATs per week and the rate-limiting step of the quantification workflow has migrated from standard preparation to data processing. The final study in this thesis discusses methods for accurate quantification of the QconCAT protein and additional applications of QconCATs for <b>testing</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometer performance...|$|E

Medical implants such as stents, bone screws and bone plates could be made by biodegradable metals. These implants would serve their purpose within the patient’s body and disintegrate harmlessly, eliminating a need for removal surgeries. Magnesium is a prime contender as a biodegradable metal due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Surface modification techniques are needed to enable its suitability for specific applications. For example, localized deliveries of drugs are needed from cardiovascular stents to treat restenosis while localized deliveries of antibiotics are needed from bone plates to treat post-operative infections. These surface coating techniques should not significantly change the underlying corrosion behavior of Magnesium while providing localized drug delivery. Organic coating such as self-assembled monolayers is a technique {{which could be used}} for localized delivery of drugs and antibiotics from the surface of magnesium. This research aims to evaluate the bio corrosion behavior of these organic coated magnesium alloys. The corrosion behavior of self-assembled monolayer coated magnesium alloy was evaluated using polarized and unpolarized methods in physiological conditions. These organic coated magnesium metals were subjected to electro chemical corrosion <b>testing,</b> <b>mass</b> loss analysis and hydrogen evolution testing. Comparison of the results obtained between the Organic coated magnesium and the control showed no statistical significant chances in the corrosion behavior.

We have used the results of this simulation to estimate the magnitude of disturbances associated with <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> charging, for the worst-case scenario, taking into account uncertainties in the model and potential charging contributions from minor cosmic-ray components.

40|$|The LISA Path finder {{mission will}} {{demonstrate}} {{the technology of}} drag-free <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> for use as inertial references in future space-based gravitational wave detectors. To accomplish this, the Path finder spacecraft will perform drag-free flight about a <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> while measuring the acceleration of this primary <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> relative to a second reference <b>test</b> <b>mass.</b> Because the reference <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> is contained within the same spacecraft, {{it is necessary to}} apply forces on it to maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces are a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Path finder system that are not present in the full LISA con figuration. While LISA Path finder has been designed to meet it's primary mission requirements in the presence of this noise, recent estimates suggest that the on-orbit performance may be limited by this 'suspension noise'. The drift-mode or free-flight experiments provide an opportunity to mitigate this noise source and further characterize the underlying disturbances that are of interest to the designers of LISA-like instruments. This article provides a high-level overview of these experiments and the methods under development to analyze the resulting data...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{residual}} gas damping {{of the motion}} of a macroscopic <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> enclosed in a nearby housing in the molecular flow regime. The damping coefficient, and thus the associated thermal force noise, is found to increase significantly when the distance between <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> and surrounding walls is smaller than the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> itself. The effect has been investigated with two torsion pendulums of different geometry and has been modelled in a numerical simulation whose predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. Relevant {{to a wide variety}} of small-force experiments, the residual-gas force noise power for the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> in the LISA gravitational wave observatory is roughly a factor 15 larger than in an infinite gas volume, though still compatible with the target acceleration noise of 3 fm s^- 2 Hz^- 1 / 2 at the foreseen pressure below 10 ^- 6 Pa.

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern gravimeters use specially-designed metal or quartz zero-length springs {{to support the}} <b>test</b> <b>mass.</b> Zero-length springs do not follow Hooke's Law, instead they have a force proportional to their length. The special property of these springs is that the natural resonant period of oscillation of the spring-mass system can be made very long - approaching a thousand seconds. This detunes the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> from most local vibration and mechanical noise, increasing the sensitivity and utility of the gravimeter. Quartz and metal springs are chosen for different reasons; quartz springs are less affected by magnetic and electric fields while metal springs have a much lower drift (elongation) with time. The <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> is sealed in an air-tight container so that tiny changes of barometric pressure from blowing wind and other weather do not change the buoyancy of the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> in air.|$|R
40|$|The NASA New Millennium Program Space Technology 7 (ST 7) {{project will}} {{validate}} technology for precision spacecraft control. The Disturbance Reduction System (DRS) {{will be part}} of the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder project. The DRS will control the position of the spacecraft relative to a reference to an accuracy of one nanometer over time scales of several thousand seconds. To perform the control, the spacecraft will use a new colloid thruster technology. The thrusters will operate over the range of 5 to 30 micro-Newtons with precision of 0. 1 micro- Newton. The thrust will be generated by using a high electric field to extract charged droplets of a conducting colloid fluid and accelerating them with a precisely adjustable voltage. The control reference will be provided by the European LISA Technology Package, which will include two nearly freefloating <b>test</b> <b>masses.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> positions and orientations will be measured using a capacitance bridge. The <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> position and attitude will be adjustable using electrostatically applied forces and torques. The DRS will control the spacecraft position with respect to one <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> while minimizing disturbances on the second <b>test</b> <b>mass.</b> The dynamic control system will cover eighteen degrees of freedom: six for each of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> and six for the spacecraft. After launch in late 2009 to a low Earth orbit, the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft will be maneuvered to a halo orbit about the Earth-Sun L 1 Lagrange point for operations...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is given of thermoelastic noise (thermal noise due to thermoelastic dissipation) in finite sized <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> of laser interferometer gravitational-wave detectors. Finite-size effects increase the thermoelastic noise by a modest amount; for example, for the sapphire <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> tentatively planned for LIGO-II and plausible beam-spot radii, {{the increase is}} ≲ 10 percent. As a side issue, errors are {{pointed out in the}} currently used formulas for conventional, homogeneous thermal noise (noise associated with dissipation which is homogeneous and described by an imaginary part of the Young’s modulus) in finite sized <b>test</b> <b>masses.</b> Correction of these errors increases the homogeneous thermal noise by ≲ 5 percent for LIGO-II-type configurations...|$|R
40|$|We are in {{the process}} of {{developing}} a detector that is capable of measuring the movement of a <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> with a spatial resolution of 10 ’s of nanometers and a temporal resolution of a few nanoseconds. This detector will be used in future experiments that will examine weakly coupled oscillators. Essentially, the detector consists of a Michelson interferometer with the mirror for one arm mounted on the <b>test</b> <b>mass.</b> A fast photodiode is used to measure changes in the interference pattern as the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> moves. In this presentation, we will detail, and explain, the design of the detector, as well as providing a status of its current capabilities...|$|R
