40|$|Despite {{the reality}} of the {{multinational}} <b>enterprise</b> <b>group,</b> many jurisdictions only deal with the single corporate entity. This is also the case in the context of cross-border insolvency. This article aims to provide guidance on how the European Union should respond to this problem. A logical first step would be to include specific provisions to deal with multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in the European Insolvency Regulation. This article elaborates on the possibility of an 'adaptive framework', as the enormous variety of possibilities in the way these multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> are structured would then be appreciated. The second step in the process of regulating multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in insolvency would be the standardization of insolvency laws on the treatment of multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in insolvency, as a universalist approach, e. g. the centralization or coordination of the insolvency proceedings against <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups,</b> would be difficult to achieve without the legal means to consolidate the insolvency proceedings against multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|A line {{of credit}} {{is one of the}} most {{flexible}} financing tools for companies. Banks give companies lines of credit to strengthen their profitability and competitive ability. On the other hand, companies draw the lines of credit that will increase banks' credit risk. It is very difficult for banks to determine the lines of credit for an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group.</b> Based on principle of credit risk evaluation and structural model, this paper first defines bank's tolerable default risk and lines of credit, and then analyzes integrated lines of credit of parent and subsidiary companies. The results of this research indicate that the lines of credit of single company is related to its asset value growth, and integrated lines of credit of an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group</b> is also related to member's asset value growth and the associated relationships. Furthermore, this study shows that the integrated lines of credit of an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group</b> can be determined by the weighted sum of member's lines of credit and the computational formula of weight. This study provides a quantitative analysis tool to ascertain the <b>enterprise</b> <b>group's</b> integrated lines of credit and analyze how the associated relationships affect the integrated lines of credit.

In this paper, we built a theoretical model of the proliferation of credit risk based on the simplified model.
