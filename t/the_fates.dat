5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of <b>the</b> <b>Fates,</b> the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of <b>the</b> <b>Fates</b> slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that can not be achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of <b>the</b> <b>Fates</b> has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of <b>the</b> <b>Fates</b> Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E

5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. This was true of William Percival Crozier's historical romance <b>The</b> <b>Fates</b> Are Laughing (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist with an eye for detail.|$|E
5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.|$|E
5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. <b>The</b> <b>fates</b> of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E

5|$|At the Iifa tree, {{the party}} defeats Kuja, {{preventing}} him from destroying Gaia as well. The fight, so near {{what they find}} to be the Crystal, the source of life, summons Necron, a force of annihilation. Its defeat destroys the Tree; the party flees, while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja. In the epilogue one year later, <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> {{of all of the}} characters are shown, and Zidane reappears in Alexandria to see Queen Garnet.|$|E
5|$|His son {{was also}} {{executed}} {{a few months}} later, and his daughter-in-law suffered for several months in prison before she was released {{in the summer of}} 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from previous titles in the Myst series, End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players {{by the addition of}} multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of the game's characters as a gift to Myst fans.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by the massive statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan army. The Lair of Typhon, hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located {{at the edge of}} the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of <b>the</b> <b>Fates.</b> At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of <b>the</b> <b>Fates</b> is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E
5|$|The Sisters of Fate– Featured in God of War II, {{they were}} the three sisters who {{controlled}} <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of all mortals, gods, and Titans, and lived on the Island of Creation. All were eventually killed by Kratos when they refused {{to allow him to}} go back in time to seek revenge on Zeus. In God of War III, their voices were heard in Kratos' psyche.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly {{over the edge of}} the cliff only to crash into a landfill. The episodes ends with a description of <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none of the first four boats was ever launched or completed {{before the end of}} the war. U-107 was 35% complete at war's end, while U-108 was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had not started on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of the pair of incomplete boats of the U-107 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E

40|$|As astronomers further {{develop an}} {{understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe, it is essential to study students’ ideas on <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe so that instructors can communicate the field’s current status more effectively. In this study, we examine undergraduate students’ preinstruction ideas of <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe in ten semester-long introductory astronomy course sections (ASTRO 101) at three institutions. We also examine students’ postinstruction ideas about <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe in ASTRO 101 over five semester-long course sections at one institution. The data include precourse surveys given {{during the first week of}} instruction (N= 264), postinstruction exam questions (N= 59), and interviews. We find that, preinstruction, more than a quarter of ASTRO 101 students either do not respond or respond with “I don’t know” when asked what <b>the</b> long-term <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe is. We also find that, though the term was not necessarily used, students tend to describe a “big chill” scenario in the preinstruction surveys, among a wide variety of other scenarios. A fraction of students describe <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of smaller-scale systems, possibly due to confusion of the hierarchical nature of structure in the Universe. Preinstruction, students mention the Universe’s expansion when describing how astronomers know <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe but do not discuss how we know the Universe is expanding or the relationship between expansion and <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of <b>the</b> Universe. Postinstruction, students’ responses shift toward greater degrees of completeness and correctness...|$|R
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none {{of the first three}} boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the rest were cancelled before any were laid down. U-101 was 47% complete at war's end, while U-102 and U-103 were only 30% and 10% complete, respectively. Although there is no specific mention of <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of the three incomplete boats of the U-101 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped in 1919 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|This game's {{challenge}} mode {{is called}} the Challenge of the Titans (seven trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., kill all enemies without being attacked). The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards, as well as usage of the abilities found in the urns during the first playthrough. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards, as does collecting twenty eyes from defeated cyclopes. A new mode, called Arena of <b>the</b> <b>Fates,</b> allows players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents to improve their skills.|$|E
5|$|Dean's {{plan was}} to airlift one {{battalion}} of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division was transported on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the chaos of the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> of many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.|$|E
