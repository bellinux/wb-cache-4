This withdrawal, seen by many as a great victory of Islamic faith over an atheist superpower, was made possible by billions of dollars in aid to the Afghan mujahideen by those two countries. Khomeini issued the fatwa on 14 February 1989. The next day came the official announcement of the completion of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, lost in the news cycle of the fatwa.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, the Prussian Cavalry having rallied, and reformed, {{in their}} turn began to drive back the French. Again <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> their hoofs approached, {{and again the}} flying host whirled past the Marshal and his anxious friend; whereupon the latter, eagerly {{watching}} his opportunity as the pursuers came on, darted forward, and seizing the bridle of a noncommissioned officer of the 6th Uhlans, named Schneider, ordered him and some Files immediately following, to dismount and assist in saving Blücher. Five or six powerful men now raised the heavy dead charger, while others extricated their commander, senseless and almost immoveable. In this state they placed him on the noncommissioned officer's horse. Just as they moved off, the French was again pressing forward with renewed speed, and Nostitz had barely time to lead the Marshal, whose senses were gradually returning, to the nearest Prussian infantry, which gladly received the party, and, retiring in perfect order, bade defiance to the attacks of its pursuers.|$|E

500|$|Before [...] "Molitva russkikh" [...] ("The Prayer of the Russians") {{was chosen}} as the {{national}} anthem of Imperial Russia in 1816, various church hymns and military marches were used to honor the country and the Tsars. Songs used include [...] "Grom pobedy, razdavaysya!" [...] (Let <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> victory sound) and [...] "Kol slaven" [...] ("How Glorious Is Our Lord"). [...] "Molitva russkikh" [...] was adopted around 1816, and used lyrics by Vasily Zhukovsky set to the music of the British anthem, [...] "God Save the King". Russia's anthem was also influenced by the anthems of France and the Netherlands, and by the British patriotic song [...] "Rule, Britannia!".|$|E
500|$|Potemkin {{was born}} into a family of middle-income noble landowners. He first {{attracted}} Catherine's favor for helping in her 1762 coup, then distinguished himself as a military commander in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). He became Catherine's lover, favorite and possibly her consort. After their passion cooled, he remained her lifelong friend and favored statesman. Catherine obtained for him the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and gave him the title of Prince of the Russian Empire among many others: he was both a Grand Admiral and the head of all of Russia's land and irregular forces. Potemkin's defining achievements include the peaceful annexation of the Crimea (1783) and the successful second Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). The fall of Ottoman stronghold Izmail that he orchestrated prompted Gavrila Derzhavin and Osip Kozlovsky to write Russia's first national anthem, [...] "Let <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> victory sound!".|$|E
500|$|In July 1790 the Russian Baltic Fleet was {{defeated}} by the Swedish at the Battle of Svensksund. Despite the damage, the silver lining for the Russians was that the Swedes now felt able to negotiate on an even footing and a peace was soon signed, based on the status quo ante bellum, thus ending the threat of invasion. The peace also freed up military resources for {{the war against the}} Turks. Potemkin had moved his evermore lavish court to Bender and there were soon more successes against Turkey, including the capture of Batal-Pasha and, on the second attempt, of Kilia on the Danube. By the end of November, only one major target remained: the Turkish fortress of Izmail. At Potemkin's request, General Suvorov commanded the assault, which proved to be costly but effective. The victory was commemorated by Russia's first, albeit unofficial, national anthem, [...] "Let <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> victory sound!", written by Gavrila Derzhavin and Osip Kozlovsky.|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E

2500|$|Records of a 13th-century {{event in}} which [...] "Greek fire" [...] {{was used by}} the Saracens against the Crusaders can be read through the Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville during the Seventh Crusade. [...] One {{description}} of the memoir says [...] "the tail of fire that trailed behind it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it came, that it sounded like <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> heaven. It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one could see all over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advance of}} the Greek Army faced fierce {{resistance}} which culminated in the 21-day Battle of Sakarya (August 23 – September 13, 1921). The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage. [...] The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take Haymana, 40 kilometers south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks {{were the first to}} withdraw to their previous lines. <b>The</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.|$|E

[...] Jadis describes viewing the city while it was full of life, quoting, [...] "It is silent now.

2500|$|An American {{break-out}} {{was achieved}} with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German {{forces in the}} Falaise pocket {{at the cost of}} British losses with the diversionary Operation Goodwood. On the early morning of 18 July 1944, Operation Goodwood began with British heavy bombers beginning carpet bombing attacks that further devastated what was left of Caen and the surrounding countryside. A British tank crewman from the Guards Armoured Division later recalled: [...] "At 0500 hours a distant thunder in the air brought all the sleepy-eyed tank crews out of their blankets. 1,000 Lancasters were flying from the sea in groups of three or four at [...] Ahead of them the pathfinders were scattering their flares and before long the first bombs were dropping". A German tankman from the 21st Panzer Division at the receiving end of this bombardment remembered: [...] "We saw little dots detach themselves from the planes, so many of them that the crazy thought occurred to us: are those leaflets?...Among <b>the</b> <b>thunder</b> <b>of</b> the explosions, we could hear the wounded scream and the insane howling of men who had [...] driven mad". The British bombing had badly smashed the German front-line units; e.g. tanks were thrown up on the roofs of French farmhouses. Initially, the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards, made rapid progress and were soon approaching the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen by noon.|$|E
2500|$|... “The [...] was mysterious for the Indians." [...] It {{was good}} when the Indians {{did not know}} the ways of the white man. It made the Indians like one family. Bad Indians could not become Hunka. It was not the white man’s way of teaching. Sometimes many Indians camped {{together}} to perform the ceremony. Then there were good times. This was usually in the summer time. The winter was not a good time for the ceremony, because food was not plenty during the winter. When many Indians gathered together for the ceremony, the old men counseled and the young men played games. The women provided plenty to eat. The children were happy and were never hungry. The young people made lover. Many sought a vision, and talked with the spirits. The good spirits attended such gatherings. The bad spirits also come. The Lakotas here practiced this ceremony for many years. It was not always the same. The shamans first learned how to perform it right. These shamans became Oglalas. The other Lakota learned how to perform it from the Oglalas. Other Indians are Hunkas, but they are not full Hunkas like the Oglalas. The young people do not become Hunka now. It is of no use to them. The old people do not pay attention to the Hunka now. The Hunka are not what they were in old times. Some old Indians could perform the ceremony right. An old Indian who wears the gee string and leggings could perform it. He might be afraid to talk like the Indians did before they lived on a reservation. It would not be right to teach the young Indians what was taught to the Hunka in old times. There are some secret things taught to a Hunka. These secrets are not good now. They are not about the spirits. The spirits will not come now. These are the spirits of the skies of the Earth, of the clouds, of <b>the</b> <b>Thunder,</b> <b>of</b> the land of pines, of the coming light of the sunset of the south, of the winds, of the waters, of flying things, of the beasts, of the insects, and of the spider. There are bad spirits also. There are ghosts and the man from the land of the pines. One spirit is stronger than another. One spirit is chief, and can influence all other spirits. These spirits come no more to the Indians of the reservation. It involved things that would not be allowed now. The Oglala did not think these things were wrong, but the white people do. For example a Hunka was taught how to steal horses and steal women from other Indians than Lakota.” “White men have their Bible and their Christ to guide them to the life to come. We Indians have our White Cow traditions and brave deeds. Let us wait, my friend, and see who gets there first.” ...|$|E
