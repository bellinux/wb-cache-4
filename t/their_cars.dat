The woman who places her suitcase on <b>their</b> <b>car</b> appears again and takes her suitcase back, and the band eventually exit from the cafe in <b>their</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} how {{the implementation of}} Remote Parking Area (RPA) and Preferential Parking Space (PPS) policy at Petra Christian University will influence the student, whose tends to use single- occupancy car as primary mode for commuting to and from campus, to choose either to park <b>their</b> <b>car</b> at distant parking lot outside campus area because they can’t add <b>their</b> <b>car</b> occupancy or add <b>their</b> <b>car</b> occupancy to get the permission to park <b>their</b> <b>car</b> in the campus parking lot. Based on the result of analysis, student tends to add more passengers to get the permission to park at the campus, than to park <b>their</b> <b>car</b> at the RPA. If the RPA and PPS implemented, the percentage distribution of car occupancy become relatively more uniform and the average car occupancy will be change from 1. 61 passengers per car up to 2. 25 passengers per car. Further researches are needed to understand the travel characteristics and mode choice behavior of campus community, to choose the optimal campus transport management strategies to be implemented...|$|R
5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field <b>their</b> <b>cars,</b> even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher's car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

50|$|Players {{have the}} ability to {{increase}} <b>their</b> <b>car’s</b> performance by applying performance upgrades to the car. The player can upgrade <b>their</b> <b>car’s</b> engine, drivetrain, suspension, tires, engine control unit (ECU) as well as add nitrous oxide, turbo chargers and reduce the car’s weight (in the form of “weight reduction packages”).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of upgrades available: Grip, which improves how well players' car turns and how much <b>their</b> <b>car</b> slides; Power, which controls how fast players' car goes and how much climbing power <b>their</b> <b>car</b> has; and Shield, which controls how much damage the car can take before being destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Five people drowned after <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> {{were swept}} away by floodwaters while trying to cross a flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications {{for an extended period}} of time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E
5|$|Four {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering, though the latter did not run <b>their</b> <b>cars.</b> Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing; both of PC Automotive's cars were outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR.
