25|$|As a form {{of energy}} heat has the unit joule (J) in the International System of Units (SI). However, in many applied fields in {{engineering}} the British <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (BTU) and the calorie are often used.

25|$|Both {{systems of}} measure were {{widely used in}} {{mechanical}} engineering, though not in electrical engineering. Some units of measure such as the horsepower or the British <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (BTU) have special names {{but by and large}} unit names are generated from their constituent components – for example, pounds per square inch. In contrast, the metric system has a special name for pressure—the pascal.|$|E
25|$|The British <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (Btu) {{is defined}} as the heat needed to raise the {{temperature}} of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} {{suboptimal}} optimization method for solving the annual hydrothermal scheduling problem. Hydrothermal scheduling is performed {{in order to}} find the optimum allocation of hydro energy so that the annual operating cost of a mixed hydro-thermal system is minimized. In the present work the hydrothermal scheduling problem is decomposed into three subproblems: maintenance of <b>thermal</b> <b>units,</b> dispatch of <b>thermal</b> <b>units,</b> and dispatch of hydro units. The algorithm takes into consideration the stochastic nature of the water inflows to the reservoir and the forced outage rates of the <b>thermal</b> <b>units.</b> Maintenance scheduling is performed based on the levelized risk criterion, dispatch of the <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> is determined based on probabilistic techniques, while the dispatch of the hydro units is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Results obtained by the application of the algorithm to a case study showing the effect of the hydro units are reported...|$|R
25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E

For this purpose, a stochastic programming procedure considering Turkish DA market mechanism is developed. Moreover, realistic scenario studies are carried out to test the profitability of coordination {{and the performance of}} the solution algorithm under different risk measures. Results show that it is more profitable to coordinate wind and <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> for DA and balancing markets than participation of wind and <b>thermal</b> <b>units</b> independently.|$|R
