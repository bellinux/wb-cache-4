40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{a cluster}} of legal documents concerning newly cleared woodland between the river Fulda and its minor tributary the Haune, copied into the earliest Fulda cartulary which was completed in 828. It elucidates the complex interactions between local landholders of varying status, the monks of Fulda and their claims to spiritual patronage and <b>tenurial</b> <b>right,</b> and the public world of legal ritual and county meetings which were central to the exercise {{of power in the}} Carolingian world. It argues that the legal rituals recorded in charters were simultaneously attempts to define and regulate the relationships between different social actors (individuals, groups and institutions) as well as to transfer rights over property. Historians need to pay particular care to the mechanisms of transmission, as the archival record wa s carefully constructed to meet immediate needs, and it may obscure the extent to which relationships and the rights embedded in them were matters of interpretation. As well as raising epistemological and methodological questions {{about the nature of the}} charter evidence, this discussion also sheds light on the nature of land claims and clearances, and the relationship between internal colonisation and the crystallisation of ecclesiastical and political structures under Carolingian rule, topics which parallel the concerns of much recent work on early medieval Iberia. Finally, it is argued that if charter sare read not of passive records of abstract rights but as active attempts to interpret social relations, they can shed some light on the identities and interests of landowners of relatively modest means, and place them at historiographial centre stage...|$|E
50|$|Property owned under {{allodial title}} is {{referred}} to as allodial land, allodium, or an allod. In the Domesday Book it is called alod. Historically, allodial title was sometimes used to distinguish ownership of land without feudal duties from ownership by feudal tenure which restricted alienation and burdened land with the <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> of a landholder's overlord or sovereign.|$|R
40|$|Local {{perspectives}} on <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> and conflict {{needs to be}} known in overcoming forest tenurial conflict thoroughly. Aiming at knowing this local perspective, {{study was conducted in}} FMU Rinjani Barat in 2013 at the villages of Senaru, Santong and Rempek, North Lombok District. Research activities included literatures review, and interview. Data were analyzed using CDA and multiple linier regression.   Results indicated that there is need for rearrangement of forest rule and the propriety of the rule, improving forest management, and accommodation to various interests on forest land as well as resources. In high forest destruction condition, forest tenurial conflict resolution should be done in the context of sustainable management which was accompanied by an increase in communication, cooperation, alignment, and mentoring to community. Related to these efforts, law enforcement is needed for improving sustainability of management, and avoiding irregularities in implementation of forest management. </span...|$|R
40|$|This {{final chapter}} reviews the {{findings}} of the empirical chapters, summarizes authors observations for China, and explains these observations within the context of global forest policy. The institutions that define land tenure and the means of delivering <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> is one great theme of China's experience [...] and this book. The impacts of spillovers from policy reform in other sectors and from general economic growth is another. It also reflects on those new issues that arose subsequent to the analyses of the other chapters and those additional issues that are becoming important only now, in the twenty-first century. Forest environmental issues are particularly complex. Finally, tenure continues to be an issue, sometimes with a distributive theme, sometimes with an efficiency theme. Restrictions on household harvest and shipments as well as high levels of forest taxation continue to constrain household forestry incentives. The central government recognizes these issues, but local administratiors will largerly determine whether future growth in China's forestry sector is characterized by imports and product substitution or by domestic production...|$|R
40|$|High {{rates of}} {{population}} growth, increased competition {{for access to}} resources, growing strains on traditional tenure systems and the wish to improve standards of living combine to threaten the tenor of everyday life. The need to maintain the environment, a reliable supply of food for domestic consumption and a continuing flow of cash income makes it necessary to plan for a better future. Largely because people cannot agree on how to resolve tenure problems their ability to manage resources is limited. Oral rules and histories which provide the basis of <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> to land and reefs are often confused and easily manipulated. Customary modes of conflict resolution are {{not strong enough to}} settle matters under dispute. Solutions imposed by the courts are frequently subject to appeal resulting in continuing litigation and mounting frustration. Is there a way out ? In this paper it is argued that communities have all the capabilities required to find their own solutions. Decision making can be assisted by outsiders working as catalysts. Researchers working with tenure holders on resource problems can help assemble information for immediate feedback into communities which can help people make better decisions about planning for sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFarmers {{worldwide}} regularly plant {{trees to}} obtain provisioning and other ecosystem services. This practice {{has come under}} scrutiny by conservationists who perceive a reduction of biodiversity due to preferential planting of exotic trees. In order to reverse this preference for exotic trees {{it is necessary to}} identify the key drivers of exotic species planting and propose alternative species of interest to farmers. We examined this question in a coffee agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats, India, a global biodiversity hotspot. We interviewed farmers regarding tree planting behaviour, preferences and constraints, and assessed the relative performance and value of native versus exotic species. Multivariateanalyses were used with six species-level characteristics and four farm-level characteristics, to reveal the most significant predictors of planting frequency. The exotic species Grevillea robusta was planted 5. 4 times more often than native trees. Individual species’ planting frequencies were most strongly related to their realised economic values, which was highest for G. robusta. Native trees with greater multipurpose utility value and stature {{were also more likely to}} be planted. Farm-level characteristics related to increased planting efforts were increasing climatic dryness, increased land area with native tree <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> and farm size. However, farmers with a greater proportion of land under secure tree tenure planted fewer trees. We conclude that although native trees had higher multipurpose utility and potential economic value than the exotic G. robusta, the latter is grown more often due to existing legal frameworks that restrict private ownership and realising monetary value from native species. If current laws were amended to increase the economic benefits obtained from native trees, they are likely to be planted more often by farmers. We propose that our results can help in implementation of the recent National Agroforestry Policy of India, as well as inform agroforestry policies and practice elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 13 December 2013. Examining Board: Professor Francesco Francioni, European University Institute (Supervisor); Professor Martin Scheinin, European University Institute; Professor Peter Hilpold, Universität Innsbruck; Professor Federico Lenzerini, Università di Siena. One of {{the most}} {{important}} innovations of the 1992 Rio Summit was the consolidation of a synergetic approach between human rights and environmental conservation and the introduction of traditional local communities as new subjects of rights in international law. By proclaiming traditional local communities - together with indigenous peoples - as 'custodians of biodiversity', the documents adopted during the meeting called upon States to protect their cultures and lifestyles by, inter alia, enhancing their rights to lands and natural resources. Such developments have reverberated in other branches of public international law. In the realm of cultural heritage law, for instance, post- 1992 instruments started to account to the interconnection between communities' culture and nature preservation, culminating in the introduction of the concept of 'cultural landscapes' in the UNESCO-World Heritage Convention and the recognition of communities' biodiversity-related knowledge and practices as a manifestation of (intangible) cultural heritage and cultural diversity. In the realm of human rights law, however, a schism is observed. While the relation culture-nature has played a fundamental {{role in the development of}} the rights of indigenous peoples, serving as key argument in the articulation of their rights to lands and natural resources, the same has not happened in the case of traditional local communities. In this light, this thesis discusses the neglect of human rights law and inquires as to possible legal avenues to address <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> of traditional local communities. Its ultimate objective is to investigate whether and to what extent recent normative developments in environmental and cultural heritage law, as well as to discuss the jurisprudential advancements on the rights of indigenous peoples, so as to whether they might inform international human rights bodies and tribunals in the adjudication of cases involving traditional local communities' access to and use of lands and natural resources...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{presents}} the successful practice of sustainable intensification of milkfish aquaculture in marine fish cages under semi-intensive grow-out {{conditions in the}} Panabo City Mariculture Park (PCMP) in Davao del Norte, Philippines. Established in 2006, PCMP became operational through the promulgation of a City Ordinance declaring 1 075 hectares of municipal waters in Panabo City as a Mariculture Development Zone/Park. The operations of PCMP were so successful that in just five years it became the third largest among the 63 operational MPs in the Philippines during 2011, with 86 private investors-locators operating a total of 322 units of cages. At present, a total of 372 units of fish cages are operating in the mariculture park (MP). A combination of factors contributed to the successful operation of PCMP, but the success is usually attributed to the effective partnership between the government (both local and national) and the private sector. The Comprehensive MP City Ordinance that governs the PCMP is strictly implemented and includes, among others, the <b>tenurial</b> <b>rights</b> and access to locators. Regulations on distances between cages are strictly enforced and security measures in the total area are jointly undertaken {{by the government and}} the locators. The national government, through the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources-National Mariculture Center (BFAR-NMC), provides technical support in all aspects from stocking to harvest during the production cycle. BFAR-NMC staff conduct regular periodic sampling of the stocks and compute feeding rates for the stocks which are implemented by the technicians/caretakers. Likewise, BFAR-NMC staff regularly monitor the water quality of the MP and the health status of the stocks. Since it became operational in 2006, the PCMP did not report a single incident of mass fish kill, which indicates that the technical guidelines of MP operations are strictly followed. Workers are trained and organized into groups by BFAR-NMC such as caretakers, cage framers, netters, harvesters, fish processors, and others, and actively participate in discussions related to MP operations to ensure protocols are properly followed. Harvests of stocks are done by skilled workers trained by BFAR-NMC, all done in the â€œBagsakan Centerâ€� or fish landing area and are well-coordinated. The support facilities in the fish landing area are provided by both the local and national government and the PCMP Producers Association. The operators provide complete data for their operations to BFAR-NMC for record keeping. The strong partnership between the national government through BFAR-NMC, the local government unit, the investors, as well as the acceptance and support from the community for the PCMP is the hallmark of its success...|$|R
