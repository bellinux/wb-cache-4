40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{changes in}} QT dispersion and {{components of the}} QT interval in patients admitted with unstable angina {{and acute myocardial infarction}} and to study the dynamics of these changes in patients with infarction. METHODS [...] Prospective study recording electrocardiograms at 50 mm/s in patients admitted with typical cardiac chest pain. Subsequent confirmation of acute myocardial infarction according to standard criteria. Single blind analysis for QT dispersion and QT components using a digitiser and simple computer program. Results are expressed as native QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, and the <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> defined as <b>QT</b> dispersion divided by cycle length and expressed as a percentage. RESULTS [...] QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, and <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> were all higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (mean (SD) 66 (18) ms, 75 (26) ms 1 / 2, and 8. 1 (2. 4) % compared with 38 (13) ms, 39 (13) ms 1 / 2, and 4. 5 (1. 7) % respectively). Dynamic changes in QTc dispersion were seen after acute infarction with significant differences in the QT components occurring between the different patient groups. Levels of QT dispersion (87 (15) ms), QTc dispersion (105 (17) ms 1 / 2), and <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> (11. 7 (0. 8) %) in the four patients with ventricular fibrillation were significantly higher. Use of <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> gave a narrower confidence interval. CONCLUSION [...] QT dispersion is increased after myocardial infarction and levels are higher in patients with ventricular fibrillation. The changes in QT dispersion are dynamic and may reflect the changing pattern of underlying ventricular recovery of ventricular excitability, which is profoundly disturbed in the earliest phase of acute infarction. Expressing QT dispersion as a percentage of cycle length (<b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio)</b> rather than using standard rate correction may be superior in identifying patients who develop ventricular fibrillation...|$|R

The effects of drugs on nervous stimulation and the electrocardiographic changes after the resection of the cardiac nerves were investigated in 45 closed chest dogs. The following results were obtained: 1. The amplitude of the Twave decreased in Y lead and increased in Z lead in 20 out of 34 {{cases in which}} the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G. (A) ] had been stimulated and in all {{cases in which the}} right recurrent cardiac nerve (R. Rec. C. N.) and the left ventromedial cervical cardiac nerve (L. V. M. C. N.) had been stimulated. Spatial maximum T vector displaced anteriorly and superiorly. The magnitude of spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 2. An increase in the amplitude of T waves in Y lead was seen in all cases in which the left stellate ganglion (L. S. G.), and the left ventrolateral cervical cardiac nerve (L. V. L. C. N.) had been stimulated, and in 14 out of 34 cases in which the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G. (B) ] had been stimulated. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly. The magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 3. The amplitude of the T wave increased in Y lead with simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly and the magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. These electrocardiographic changes were similar to the changes which occurred with single L. S. G. stimulation. 4. Rotation of the T loop in the left saggital plane was clockwise in more than 80 % of cases with R. S. G. stimu-lation. However, rotation of the T loop in left saggital plane was counter clockwise in more than 75 - 80 % of cases with L. S. G. and simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. These results suggest that right and left cardiac sympathetic nerves innervate different myocardial areas and affect the local myocardial action potentials to cause these electrocardiographic changes. 5. In more than 40 % of cases with stimulation of left cardiac sympathetic nerves (L. S. G., L. V. L. C. N.). arrythmias such as A-V dissociation and A-V junc-tional rythm were recognized. In more than 90 % of cases with stimulation of right cardiac sympathetic nerves (R. S. G., R. Rec. C. N.), marked increase of sinus rythm occurred. 6. These electrocardiographic changes resulting from nervous stimulation decreased or disappeared after the use of propranolol. These results suggest that these electrocardiographic changes were caused by β -effects of catecholamines. 7. The <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> corrected by the formula of Bazett increased in all cases of right and left cardiac sympathetic nervous stimulation. 8.

40|$|It may {{be rather}} note-worthy {{that among the}} cases {{suffered}} from vegetative dystonia the postextrasystolic phenomenon including the elevation of ST segment were not rarely seen in the both {{the first and the}} second normal beats. The rheumatic diseases showed sometimes the prolonged PQ and the abnormally deformed T waves, The ventricular gradient remained usually within normal variation in the coronary disorders even complicated with the changes of QRS. 3. It is difficult to find out any direct correlation between the changes of cardiodynamical values and the occurrence of postextrasystolic phenomenon, however in the cases with the volume response (Blumberger), PQ was often shortened and in cases with the pressure response (Blumberger) T wave was used to be abnormally deformed. The dynamics of the preextrasystolic basic beat does not necessarily differ from that of the other basic beat. In the preextrasystolic basic beat with dynamics {{different from that of the}} other basic beat, 2 ̆ 2 Anspnnungszeit 2 ̆ 2 may be able to be either prolonged or shortened; consequenty the integrative conclusion is not so easily to be drawn as Baschieri et al have emphasized. The first poextrasystolic beat has usually the large stroke volume enough to dynamically compensate the decreased stroke volume of premature beat, showing the shortened 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungszeit 2 ̆ 2. The first postextrasystolic heart beat without shortedened 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungszeit 2 ̆ 2 can, as a rule, be considered as dynamically decompensated first postextrasystolic beat implies in itself the possibility to newly initiate an extrasysteole. The electrocardiograms of the cases complicated with premature beats, indifferently from the existence of the cardiac disorders, were investigated with special reference to the dynamics of the postextrasystolic phenomenon, and then the correlation between mechanical and electrical phenomenon was compared in order to examine the clinical significance of the postextrsystolic phenomenon. Statistically as to the premature beats here observed, there could not be found any difference of frequency between male and female. Most of patients were above 40 years of age. The seasonal occurrence of premature beats here examined, was most often seen in winter and easly spring. From the view point of the kinds of underlying diseases, premature beats were most commonly observed among arterial hypertension inclusive of hypertonic diseases, so that it could not necessarily be said that the greatest number of premature beats is seen in congestive heart failure; however on the whole, premature beats here discussed were found among cardiovascular disorders by an overwhelming majority. About the classification of the origins of premature beats the compensatory ventricular extrasystoles were most often observed, then the auricular, the interpolated ventricular and the atrioventricular premature beats were put in order. 1. In the connection of postextrasystolic phenomenon, the shortening of both PQ and <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> (Bazett) was usually seen, but in the interpolated ventricular premature beats both PQ and <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> were prolonged. As far ST-T, the depression was often found. U waves increased in their height in the first postextrasystolic normal beats, whereas they rather decreased in the second postextrasystolic. So far as this observation is concerned the changes upon P and QRS of postextrasystolic normal beats were relatively uncommon. 2. The myocardial damages did not always show the positive postextrasystolic phenomenon in like manner that the congestive heart failure was not necessarily accompanied with premature beats...|$|R

Methods: The following parameters in lead II were retrospectively analyzed from the pre-test ECG in 62 patients undergoing FCT for suspected BS: The {{presence or absence of}} S waves, S wave amplitude, duration and upslope duration; J point parameters- Early repolarization, QRS notch, and QRS Slur; ST segment parameters-lack of isoelectric ST segment, ST duration and QT interval. Results: 48 had positive FCT (Group- 1) while 14 were negative for FCT(Group- 2). Lack of an isoelectric ST segment (50 % vs 14. 29 %, p =  0. 018) and slurring of QRS (33. 33 % vs 0 %, p =  0. 014) was more common in Group- 1 than Group- 2. Group- 1 had shorter ST segment duration (median 81. 5 (IQR 64 – 103. 5) vs 110 (IQR 90 – 132), p =  0. 002) and shorter ST: <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> (median 0. 28 (IQR 0. 22 – 0. 35) vs 0. 23 (0. 18 – 0. 27), p =  0. 007). QRS notch/depressed J point (87. 5 %), QRS slur (100 %), and lack of isoelectric ST segment (92. 31 %) had high sensitivity for predicting an inducible Type 1 Brugada pattern. Combining two parameters- ST: QT ratio< 0. 24 and lack of isoelectric ST segment-considerably improved the specificity (73. 3 %), and the positive predictive value of the test to 76 %.

Their ages ranged from 33 to 70 years (the average was 51. 6 ± 7. 8 years of age). The patients were divided into four groups according to changes in ST segment and T wave on standard 12 lead ECG (Ⅲ, aVR were excluded) : Group A consisted of 10 subjects, whose ECG showed so-called "Strain Pattern"; Group B included 22 subjects, showing ischemic depression less than 0. 5 mm below the isoelectric line or low T wave (T/R≦ 1 / 20 and R≧ 10 mm); Group C included 17 subjects, junctional depression was equal to or exceeded 1. 0 mm; Group D included 27 subjects without marked STT change. Twenty healthy men (6 males and 14 females) were studied as control. They {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 62 (the average was 36. 7 ± 14. 1 years of age). As a rule, they were subjected to the Master's test (double two step). In the pre-exercise electrocardiogram of Group A, QRS voltage, LAD and <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> were significantly greater than any other groups. In the post-exercise electrocardiogram, Group A showed chiefly T wave changes without ST deviation. I could not find any cases in the group with positive responce. Therefore, the "Strain Pattern" with marked QRS high voltage might be secondary STT changes. On the other hand, patients in Group B and D showed mainly ST changes and most of them were determined to have positive responce of the test.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electrical}} stimulation of unilateral {{right and left}} stellate ganglia (SG) on coronary hemodynamics and the cardiac surface electrocardiogram (ECG) was studied in openchest anesthetized dogs. The results were as follows: 1) Both right and left SG stimulation resulted in significant increase of mean coronary blood flow, stroke diastolic coronary blood flow, left ventricular segmental contraction, heart rate and aortic blood pressure, with decrease of stroke systolic coronary blood flow, and coronary vascular resistance, Except for heart rate and blood pressure, these changes caused by left SG stimulation were significantly greater in the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) area than in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) area. However, right SG stimulation disclosed {{no significant difference between}} the two coronary areas. Left SG stimulation increased the positivity of the T wave of the cardiac surface ECG of the LCX area and the negativity of the LAD area, while right SG stimulation increased the positivity of the T wave in both areas. The QT interval of the cardiac surface ECG was unchanged or slightly shortened, but the <b>QT</b> <b>ratio</b> by Bazzet's formula was increased in both areas by SG stimulation. The data obtained suggest that the functional distribution of right SG and left SG innervation to the ventricles is different, that the LAD area is predominantly innervated by right SG, and the LCX area is innervated equally by right and left SG. 2) Intravenous (I. V.) administration of phentolamine (0. 1 mg/kg/min.) resulted in no significant change in hemodynamics or ECG patterns produced by SG stimulation, as compared. with untreated animals. However, administration of propranolol (0. 5 mg/kg I. V.) inhibited the effect of SG stimulation on coronary hemodynamics and cardiac surface ECG. This suggests that the effect of electrical SG stimulation may be caused by catecholamine release at sympathetic nerve endings, hence, beta receptor stimulation at coronary artery areas...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{assessing}} {{effect of}} ischemia on ventricular repolarization are mostly directed towards patients with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD); however, similar reports on cardiac syndrome X (CSX) are scarce. Whether microvascular dysfunction of CSX and ischemia induced by CAD produce comparable effect on ventricular repolarization is unclear and deserve further studies. In the present study, ECG measures of ventricular repolarization were compared between CAD and CSX patients (40 subjects in each group). Following evaluation of sociodemographic characteristics, medical and past medical history, a resting ECG {{was used to assess}} measurements of ventricular repolarization in each patient, namely, QT interval (QT), corrected QT interval (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), corrected QT dispersion (QTcd), adjacent QT dispersion (AdQTd), <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> (QTdR), JT dispersion (JTd) and Corrected JT dispersion (JTcd). Results showed comparable QT intervals and QTd in CAD and CSX patients even after adjustment for the possible variations in gender, age and body mass index of the studied groups. Although JTd was increased in CSX subjects (26. 6 ± 7. 2 ms) compared with CAD patients (22. 7 ± 6. 5 ms, p = 0. 019), statistical significance disappeared after correcting JT for variations in heart rate. QT and QTc were significantly below 440 ms in CAD as well as CSX patients (p < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The proarrhythmic risk {{of class}} I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents {{in combination with}} myocardial ischemia is mainly the result of their effects on ventricular repolarization. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of class Ic antiarrhythmic agents on QT dispersion during myocardial ischemia. Background. QT interval dispersion on the 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) has been suggested as a noninvasive marker of inhomogeneous ventricular repolarization and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. Methods. In a randomized, double-blind study, 98 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were pretreated with propafenone or placebo. QT dispersion was defined as a maximal minus minimal QT interval on the 12 -lead ECG before and after PTCA. The power of the study to detect clinically meaningful differences in QT dispersion was 0. 75, and a twofold increase in QT dispersion in the propafenone group compared with the placebo group was considered clinically relevant. Results. The QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals increased significantly during occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (9 % and 11 %, respectively, p < 0. 05), whereas occlusion of the circumflex and right coronary arteries had no effect. QTc dispersion increased significantly in the propafenone group during ischemia (+ 52 %, p = 0. 002, vs. + 23 %, p = 0. 15). The most considerable effect on QT dispersion was observed during LAD occlusion and ischemia of the anterior wall (+ 74 %, p = 0. 025). Corrected JT dispersion (+ 57 %, p = 0. 017, vs. + 24 %, p = 0. 23) and the <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>ratio</b> (+ 1. 6 %, p = 0. 031, vs. 0. 9 %, p = 0. 34) showed similar effects. Plasma levels of propafenone (522 ± 165 μg/liter) did not influence the results. Conclusions. During myocardial ischemia, particularly during LAD occlusion, propafenone results in a significant increase in QT dispersion. The results indicate that QT interval prolongation and enhanced QT dispersion reflect inhomogeneous ventricular repolarization generated by the ischemic anterior wall of the myocardium. These observations may demonstrate a clinically important interaction between myocardial ischemia, repolarization variables and propafenone. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 561 – 7...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} markers of torsades de pointes (TdP) in patients with drug-associated long QT syndrome (LQTS). BackgroundDrug-induced LQTS includes individuals developing marked prolongation of ventricular repolarization on exposure to an offending drug. Under these conditions, TdP develops in some but not all patients. MethodsThis was a case-control study of 123 adults with drug-associated LQTS. Patients were divided into LQTS only (LQTS; n = 40, QT > 500 ms on drug) and LQTS + TdP (TdP; n = 83). ResultsBaseline QT intervals were similar in the 2 groups (381 ± 38 ms [LQTS] vs. 388 ± 43 ms [TdP]). Clinical variables associated with risk of TdP included hypokalemia and female gender; by contrast, persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) at the time of drug discontinuation for QT prolongation was protective despite similar heart rates in AF and sinus rhythm (n = 20, 71 ± 13 beats/min vs. 69 ± 13 beats/min). Electrocardiographic variables that significantly increased the risk for TdP included absolute and rate-corrected QT intervals (QTc) on drug therapy, the magnitude of QT and QTc interval prolongation, and the change in Tpeak to Tend (ΔTp–Te), a relatively new index of transmural dispersion of repolarization and potential arrhythmogenicity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that only gender was predictive for TdP, whereas persistent AF at the time of drug discontinuation for <b>QT</b> prolongation (odds <b>ratio</b> 0. 14, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03 to 0. 63, p = 0. 01) was negatively associated with the arrhythmia. ConclusionsThis study strongly suggests that despite ongoing rate irregularity, AF reduces the likelihood of developing TdP after the administration of drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} free-surface evolution for inviscid, incompressible, irrotational, horizontally forced sloshing in a twodimensional rectangular vessel with an inhomogeneous bottom topography. The numerical scheme uses a time-dependent conformal mapping to map the physical fluid domain to a rectangle in the computational domain with a time-dependent aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>Q(t),</b> known as the conformal modulus. The advantage of this approach over conventional potential flow solvers is the solution automatically satisfies Laplace’s equation for all time, hence only {{the integration of the}} two free-surface boundary conditions is required. This makes the scheme computationally fast, and as grid points are required only along the free-surface, high resolution simulations can be performed which allows for simulations for mean fluid depths close to the shallow water water regime. The scheme is robust and can simulate both resonate and non-resonate cases, where in the latter, the large amplitude waves are well predicted. Results of nonlinear simulations are presented in the case of non-breaking waves for both an asymmetrical ‘step’ and a symmetric ‘hump’ bottom topography. The natural free-sloshing mode frequencies are compared with the small topography asymptotic results of Faltinsen and Timokha (2009) (Sloshing, Cambridge University Press (Cambridge)), and are found to be lower than this asymptotic prediction for moderate and large topography magnitudes. For forced periodic oscillations it is shown that the hump profile is the most effective topography for minimising the nonlinear response of the fluid, and hence this topography would reduce the stresses on the vessel walls generated by the fluid. Results also show that varying the width of the step or hump has a less significant effect than varying its magnitude...|$|R

The aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization in patients with T 2 DM by using Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT <b>ratio</b> and Tp-e/corrected <b>QT</b> interval (QTc) <b>ratio.</b> MethodsForty-three patients with T 2 DM and 43 healthy control subjects, matched by gender and age, were studied. All participants underwent electrocardiography (ECG) recording. PR, RR and QT intervals represents the ECG intervals. These are not abbreviations. In all literature these ECG intervals are written like in this text. Tp-e intervals were measured from 12 -lead ECG. Rate QTc was calculated by using the Bazett's formula. Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were also calculated. ResultsMean Tp-e interval was significantly prolonged in patients with T 2 DM compared to controls (79. 4 ± 10. 3, 66. 4 ± 8. 1 ms, respectively; P< 0. 001). We also found significantly higher values of Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with diabetes than controls (0. 21 ± 0. 03, 0. 17 ± 0. 02 and 0. 19 ± 0. 02, 0. 16 ± 0. 02, respectively; P< 0. 001).

We concluded that T 2 DM leads to augmentation of transmural dispersion of repolarization suggesting increased risk for ventricular arrhythmogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The "living" and/or {{controlled}} cationic ring-opening bulk copolymerization of oxetane (Ox) with tetrahydropyran (THP) (cyclic ether with no homopolymerizability) at 35 °C {{was examined}} using ethoxymethyl- 1 -oxoniacyclohexane hexafluoroantimonate (EMOA) and (BF 3 · CH 3 OH) THP as fast and slow initiator, respectively, yielding living and nonliving polymers with pseudoperiodic sequences (i. e., each pentamethylene oxide fragment {{inserted into the}} polymer is flanked by two trimethylene oxide fragments). Good control over number-average molecular weight (Mn up to 150000 g mol- 1) with molecular weight distribution (MWD ∼ 1. 4 - 1, 5) broader than predicted by the Poison distribution (MWDs > 1 + 1 /DPn) was attained using EMOA as initiating system, i. e., C 2 H 5 OCH 2 Cl with 1. 1 equiv of AgSbF 6 as a stable catalyst and 1. 1 equiv of 2, 6 -di-tert-butylpyridine used as a non-nucleophilic proton trap. With (BF 3 · CH 3 OH) THP, a drift of the linear dependence M n(GPC) vs Mn(theory) to lower molecular weight was observed together with the production of cyclic oligomers, ∼ 3 - 5 % of the Ox consumed in THP against ∼ 30 % in dichloromethane. Structural and kinetics studies highlighted a mechanism of chains growth where the rate of mutual conversion between "strain ACE species" (chain terminated by a tertiary 1 -oxoniacyclobutane ion, Al) and "strain-free ACE species" (chain terminated by a tertiary 1 -oxoniacyclohexane ion, Tl) depends on {{the rate at which}} Ox converts the stable species T 1 (kind of "dormant" species) into a living "propagating" center A 1 (i. e., k aapp[Ox]). The role of the THP solvent associated with the suspension of irreversible and reversible transfer reactions to polymer, when the polymerization is initiated with EMOA, was predicted by our kinetic considerations. The activation -deactivation pseudoequilibrium coefficient (Qt) was then calculated in a pure theoretical basis. From the measured apparent rate constant of Ox (kOxapp) and THP (kTHPapp = ka(endo) app) consumption, <b>Qt</b> and reactivity <b>ratio</b> (kp/kd, k a(endo) /ka(exo), and ks/ka(endo) were calculated, which then allow the determination of the transition rate constant of elementary step reactions that governs the increase of Mu with conversion...|$|R
