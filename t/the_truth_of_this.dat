The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Calloway surrenders.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E

25|$|Sometimes a {{conjecture}} {{is called}} a hypothesis when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conjecture. These are called conditional proofs: the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.|$|E

The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife however died in childbirth, giving birth to a stilborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.|$|E
25|$|The successors of Obelerio {{inherited}} a united Venice. By the Pax Nicephori (803-814), the two emperors had recognised that Venice {{belonged to the}} Byzantine sphere of influence. Many centuries later, the Venetians claimed that the treaty had recognised Venetian de facto independence, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> claim is doubted by modern scholars. A Byzantine fleet sailed to Venice in 807 and deposed the Doge, replacing him with a Byzantine governor. Nevertheless, {{during the reign of}} the Participazio family, Venice grew into its modern form. Though Heraclean by birth, Agnello, the first Participazio doge, was an early immigrant to Rialto and his dogeship was marked by the expansion of Venice towards the sea via the construction of bridges, canals, bulwarks, fortifications, and stone buildings. The modern Venice, at one with the sea, was being born. Agnello was succeeded by his son Giustiniano, who stole the remains of Saint Mark the Evangelist from Alexandria, took them to Venice, and made him the republic's patron saint.|$|E
25|$|Kublai Khan had suspicions, and justifiable fears, of {{co-operation}} between Nayan and Kaidu, {{and sent}} his leading general Bayan to investigate. One contemporary source relates that Nayan invited Bayan to a feast, but forewarned of a trap, Bayan escaped. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> incident, Bayan was sent with an army to occupy Karakorum {{in order to}} block Kaidu from moving eastward and joining Nayan. Kublai himself, despite his advanced age of 72 years, raised another army and rapidly moved against Nayan in Manchuria. The speed and scale of Kublai's response meant that the various rebels were given very limited opportunities to co-ordinate their movements and concentrate their forces, and left them open to being defeated individually. The imperial fleet moved great quantities of supplies {{to the mouth of}} the Liao River to support the campaign. Nayan was himself encamped {{on the banks of the}} same river further inland. Kublai directed his forces from a palanquin mounted on, or drawn by, four elephants.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 4th century, the Britons of what is now Wales and the South-Western {{peninsula}} of Great Britain {{began to}} emigrate to Armorica. The history behind such an establishment is unclear, but medieval Breton, Angevin and Welsh sources connect it to a figure known as Conan Meriadoc. Welsh literary sources assert that Conan came to Armorica on the orders of the Roman usurper Magnus Maximus, who sent some of his British troops to Gaul to enforce his claims and settled them in Armorica. This account was supported by the Counts of Anjou, who claimed descent from a Roman soldier expelled from Lower Brittany by Conan on Magnus's orders. Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story, Brythonic (British Celtic) settlement probably increased during the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. Scholars such as Léon Fleuriot have suggested a two-wave model of migration from Britain which saw the emergence of an independent Breton people and established the dominance of the Brythonic Breton language in Armorica. Their petty kingdoms are now known by the names of the French counties that succeeded themDomnonée (Devon), Cornouaille (Cornwall), Léon (Caerleon); but these names in Breton and Latin are in most cases identical to their British homelands. (In Breton and French, however, Gwened or Vannetais continued the name of the indigenous Veneti.) Although the details remain confused, these colonies consisted of related and intermarried dynasties which repeatedly unified (as by the 7th-century Saint Judicaël) before splintering again according to Celtic inheritance practices. The area was finally consolidated in the 840s under Nominoe in resistance to Frankish control. Among the immigrant Britons, there were some clergymen who helped the evangelisation of the region, which was still pagan, particularly in rural areas.|$|E

500|$|Constantine Doukas {{was the son}} of Andronikos Doukas, a {{prominent}} general under Emperor Leo VI the Wise (reigned 886–912) and the first prominent member of the Doukas family. Constantine first appears in the sources in 904, during the attempted flight of the Arab-born eunuch Samonas, one of the emperor's most trusted aides, to Syria. Constantine captured Samonas at the Monastery of the Holy Cross at Siricha, near the river Halys, and escorted him back to Constantinople, where an enquiry into the matter was held before the Senate. Leo, who was still attached to his servant, enjoined Constantine to maintain that Samonas had in fact been making a pilgrimage to the shrine of Siricha, and not the Arab frontier. When the senators however asked Constantine to verify <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> claim by swearing on [...] "God and the emperor's head", he refused to hide the truth. Samonas was punished by house arrest, and although he was pardoned by Leo after only four months and restored to his offices, he had conceived a deep enmity towards the Doukai.|$|E

500|$|At 10:00am on December 20, 1908 in Danbury, Clemens {{went for}} a sleigh ride with Russian concert pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch who was staying with her father at his residence, Innocence at Home, in Redding. While passing through Redding Glen, the horse took fright at a wind-whipped {{newspaper}} and bolted with driver Gabrilowitsch losing control. At {{the top of a}} hill, next to a [...] drop, the sleigh overturned, throwing Clemens out. Gabrilowitsch leaped to the ground and caught the horse by the head, stopping it as it was about to plunge over the bank, dragging Clemens with her dress caught in a runner. Having only sprained his right ankle, Gabrilowitsch returned Clemens to home, unharmed except for the shock of the accident. Twain biographer Michael Shelden doubted <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> heroic tale and supplied a motive for why the story might have been planted in the press, namely, to quiet rumors that Clara {{was having an affair with}} Charles E.

500|$|Salih {{was among}} those {{tortured}} by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her. Zakkar writes {{that it is not}} known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, [...] "an energetic and bold" [...] emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab. Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe {{for the remainder of the}} night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq. Zakkar questions <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story, and asserts it was more likely that Salih escaped either through bribery or a friendly arrangement with a guard.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after this, Histiaeus was {{released}} from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia. He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: [...] "I will tell you, Histiaeus, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> business: {{it was you who}} stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on." [...] Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.|$|E
