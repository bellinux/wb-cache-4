500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E
2500|$|According to The War for Late Night, [...] "the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC {{came to call}} it—changed the tone. This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves." [...] However, {{the moment}} that [...] "represented {{the point of no}} return" [...] came that Wednesday night, as a [...] "clearly liberated" [...] O'Brien made this joke in his monologue: [...] "I'm trying very hard to stay {{positive}} here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E

Mikay and Gino try to defend themselves, and tell Jao that they did nothing to pull <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>out.</b> But Jao is not convinced, and swears to them that he will bring them down, not knowing that it was his own mother (who he still {{believes}} is dead), who really had <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> of the tournament.|$|E
