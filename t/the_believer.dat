5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E

50|$|For the {{majority}} of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water {{in the name of}} the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience symbolizing <b>the</b> <b>believer's</b> faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, <b>the</b> <b>believer's</b> death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to <b>the</b> <b>believer's</b> faith in <b>the</b> final resurrection of the dead.|$|R
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform <b>the</b> <b>believer,</b> and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites <b>the</b> <b>believer.</b> Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

Christopher Nolan was nominated for three Best Director awards including the Directors Guild of America Award and was awarded one from the Independent Spirit Awards.

25|$|Sanctification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} in which God makes <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people. The good works accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary outworking of the believer's salvation, though they do not cause <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> to be saved.

25|$|Shi'ahs {{offer this}} as a one rakat salah {{at the end of}} salatul layl (the night prayer), which is an {{optional}} prayer according to some shi'ah scholars, and a wajib (obligatory) prayer according to others. This is to be prayed any time after Isha, up until fajr. The best time to pray it is the last third of the night (the night being divided into three, between maghrib and fajr of that night). It is considered highly meritorious by all shi'ah Muslims, and is said to bring numerous benefits to <b>the</b> <b>believer,</b> mainly gaining proximity to Allah. There are various methods of salatul-layl's performance, including shorter and longer versions, in the longer version <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> must perform 8 nawafil salah, in sets of 2 rakats each, then they must pray a 2 rakats salah called 'salatul shafa'ah' this is to include surah nas after surah fatihah in the first rakat and surah falaq after surah fatihah in the secound rakat, and unusually no qunut (a du'ah recited before going into ruku' of the second rakat of most prayers performed by shi'ahs) It is after this that <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> performs salatul witr, it's long method being - Starting with takbiratul ehram, then surah fatihah, then surah ikhlas, then surah falaq, then surah nas, then the hands are raised to recite qunut, upon which <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> can recite any du'a, however there are many recommended du'as for this purpose. Within qunut, <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> must pray for the forgiveness of 40 believers, then further prayers are read where <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> asks for forgiveness for himself a certain number of times using specified phrases and amounts of times to repeat those phrases. <b>The</b> <b>believer</b> then completes the salah in the usual way, by completing his qunut, reciting takbir whilst rasing his hands, going into ruku' and reciting the usual phrase for that, then returning up right and reciting takbir whilst doing so and upon being upright recites 'sami allahu liman hamida' (verily Allah has heard the one who has praised him) thereupon <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> recites takbir whilst raising his hands and goes into sajda. He recites the proscribed phrase in sajda rises, recites takbir whilst rising and then again whilst returnin to sajdah, then rises with takbir again and recites tashahud and salam, thus ending this prayer. It is then optional to recite certain other du'as and dhikr (remembrance of Allah through certain phrases and some of his names being repeated) It is then recommended to perform and sajdah ash-shukr (prostration of thanks) and to then recite ayatul kursi (verse of the throne) and then perform another sajdah ash-shukr.|$|E

25|$|Protestants {{perceived}} Roman Catholic salvation to {{be dependent}} upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works.
