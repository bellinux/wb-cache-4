40|$|Summary An {{investigation}} of the pervasive impact of multi-access technologies, i. e. the internet, wireless data, wired and wireless voice, and interactive TV, on consumer electronic auctions {{was carried out in}} the Dutch market by some researchers. This article extends the analytic generalizability of their research findings through a replication study in the emerging markets of China. By comparing the empirical research findings, we reveal that there is {{no significant difference in the}} impacts of multi-access technologies on consumer electronic auctions within dissimilar contexts; as long as both the business and the technologies are prevalent. This affirms the argument that the use of more sophisticated multi-access technologies has positive effects on the maturity level of exchange processes and stakeholders interactions in consumer electronic auctions, thereby leading to an increase in the expected success of the auctions.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new technologies is relentless. While there are many studies that have examined the transformative value, impact, and adoption, {{our understanding of the}} underlying ecosystem that shapes the {{emergence of}} these new technologies is surprisingly limited. Motivated by the call for pursuing contemporary information systems (IS) research that captures market realities and provides practical relevance, this study uses a data-driven visualization approach to map the ecosystem structure of emerging technologies. We use text mining to identify and extract relevant companies associated with 34 emerging technologies from publicly available data sources (business and technology news, press releases, industry briefings, analyst reports, and blogs) and then apply graph visualization techniques to reveal the corresponding ecosystem structure. We frame our analysis and discussion of these ecosystems in terms of the emerging <b>technology’s</b> <b>maturity</b> stage and time to mainstream adoption. We illustrate our approach using visualizations of nine emerging technologies. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications and offer directions for future data-driven emerging technology ecosystem research...|$|R

We propose in this article a detailed empirical study. It is based on a dozen of cases studies of established firms, which currently experience such innovation processes.

In 1999, the United States General Accounting Office produced an influential report that examined {{the differences in}} technology transition between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD adopt the use of NASA's Technology Readiness Levels {{as a means of}} assessing <b>technology</b> <b>maturity</b> prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs.

Nonetheless, the pilot plant was shut down. The reasons for failure were the cost of aluminium chloride, general <b>technology</b> <b>maturity</b> problems, and leakage of the trace amounts of toxic polychlorinated biphenyl compounds.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} noise on civil {{aviation}} {{is not just}} a localised airport problem, but a global concern, due to the ever-increasing demands for passenger travel. The challenge of designing a ‘Silent Aircraft’ lies within the development, integration, and optimisation of efficient airframe-engine technologies. This research study investigates the design of novel airframes with the aim of producing a methodology that incorporates airframe noise. Studies investigating the design of Broad Deltas (BD), Blended Wing Bodies (BWB), and Joined Wing airframe configurations are integrated with innovative propulsion systems designs to identify key parameters in order to design a Silent Aircraft. The airframe configuration {{plays an important role in}} the total aircraft noise, where the novel airframes that are analysed, are compared to a datum ‘baseline’ aircraft. All novel configurations show significant improvements in airframe noise reduction, enhanced by the addition of ultra-efficient propulsion systems, for which integration studies are discussed. The research into novel airframes uses a developed design methodology which integrates design considerations such as aerodynamics, performance, and cost models to complement the noise analysis and identify the most silent airframe configuration. The research goal was to identify a silent airframe solution for a future viable short-medium range airliner, where the final solutions described suggest proposals for the future development of aviation. The proposals suggested describe a short-term solution to the noise challenge, with a longer-term solution to aid the development of <b>technologies,</b> <b>maturity</b> in <b>technology</b> release levels (TRLs), and development of a future 2050 medium capacity civil airliner.

40|$|DoD {{acquisition}} guidance as {{embodied in}} the Draft 5000 series publications requires that hardware and software-intensive systems exhibit an appropriate level of maturity {{as part of the}} entrance criteria at milestone decision points. Spiral development and evolutionary acquisition require mature technologies for incremental insertion into DoD systems. Section 804 of the FY 2003 Defense Authorization Act requires the department to improve the software acquisition process by emphasizing maturity of software products offered to the government. There is no guidance on how to measure technology or product maturity. The NASA developed Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale is an existing metric for describing technology maturity; however, there is no standard repeatable method for determining the TRL achieved by a given technology. This paper reviews the NASA TRL scale to include TRL descriptions for hardware, softwareintensive, and practice-based technologies. It then introduces a spreadsheet application that allows the user to answer a series of questions about a technology program. The spreadsheet calculates and displays the TRL achieved. The paper describes in detail the algorithms used to compute and display the appropriate TRL for a given technology. The final section of the paper outlines future work contemplated and required.
