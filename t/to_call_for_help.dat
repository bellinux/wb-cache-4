5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the fort}} {{appears to have been}} started by Fumomadi, Sultan of Pate. The Mazrui leader Abdalla bin Hemed, in an uneasy {{alliance}} with Pate, was also involved in the construction. One story was built, but with the death of Funomadi in 1809 construction halted. In 1812 Lamu gained an unexpected victory at the Battle of Shela over the forces of Pate and Mombasa. The continued threat prompted them <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from Oman. Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman (r. 1804–1856), was said to have assisted in the renewed construction, which began in 1813 and was completed around 1821.|$|E
5000|$|... “This finding, {{combined}} with the survey data indicating a slight decrease in students’ barriers <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> suggests {{that the increase in}} <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> in an alcohol-related emergency was a function of the MAP and related educational efforts rather than changes in drinking practices.” ...|$|R

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|In , Lightning is revived after 500 {{years by}} the god Bhunivelze. The world is set to end in {{thirteen}} days, and Lightning is chosen as the Savior, a spiritual guide for humanity, which has ceased to age due {{to the influence of}} chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected. Aided by Hope, Lightning frees her former allies of emotional burdens, reunites with Odin {{in the form of a}} white Chocobo, and frequently crosses paths with Lumina, the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. Lightning begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world. When the end of the world arrives, Lightning fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping Lightning as Etro's replacement. Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, Lightning instead chooses <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> and to accept Lumina as a part of herself. Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. Lightning then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{workers are}} {{recommended}} {{to carry a}} whistle <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> if they are injured. Colleagues may be close by, but unable to hear shouts for help over the noise of a running chainsaw.|$|E

50|$|The {{service has}} handled about 85,000 calls in two years. It {{is run by}} 40 volunteers and boasts of a nearly 30,000-strong network ready <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> It {{is said to have}} eminent retired civil servants, doctors and lawyers on its {{advisory}} board.|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} years, volunteers faced {{a lack of}} funding, {{equipment}} and formal training and often could not respond <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> In 2012, the group lost its only ambulance and the rescue service was suspended for one year while funds were gathered to purchase a new vehicle.|$|R

25|$|During , after Alfred is {{attacked}} by Hush and infected with a fear toxin, he is briefly transferred to Arkham {{before it is}} attacked {{as part of the}} conspiracy. However, Alfred manages to survive the explosion of the asylum and trick Bane into helping him reach an emergency cave Batman had installed under Arkham, the cave's defences knocking Bane out and allowing Alfred <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
25|$|A small tug ship detaches {{from the}} Fesarius and tows the Enterprise deep into First Federation space where Balok states he will intern {{the crew and}} destroy the Enterprise. Kirk orders the Enterprise to {{gradually}} resist the tug ship's tractor beam. Just as its engines are about to explode from overload, the Enterprise breaks free. This apparently disables the alien vessel, which is unable <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from its mother ship.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{cited by}} Benson is that private police {{would have a}} contractual responsibility to protect their customers. In Warren v. District of Columbia, {{the court found that}} public police have no such responsibility. Thus, private police can be sued if they fail <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> <b>for</b> instance.|$|R

The 2nd Cavalry Brigade, along with the 119th Battery RFA and L Battery RHA, were sent to their aid.

25|$|Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão was {{alerted to}} {{the attack on the}} presidential home and left his home by car for Dili.

Another party of rebels shot out the tires of Gusmão's car on its way to Dili, but the car continued for some distance before Gusmão, unhurt, abandoned it and ran into the bush <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
25|$|In practice, no gag is {{effective}} enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud, inarticulate noises <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Thus, {{a pattern of}} noises, such as three grunts in rapid succession, is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal safety mechanism, such as a solid object held in the hand that can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008, the Taliban began {{operating}} {{closer to}} the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, attacking government positions in Marja (town) and Nad Ali Districts, just 10 kilometers from the city. The local authorities were at first reluctant <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from ISAF forces, for fear their intervention might cause civilian casualties. In September, after both districts had fallen to the Taliban, British Army officials said these setbacks were caused by the defection of pro-government militias linked to local drug-trafficking mafias, that the Taliban had promised to protect from poppy-eradication programs.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 in Sabaki Village, Malindi District, Kenya, a male {{farm manager}} was {{reportedly}} attacked after stepping on a 13-ft python, the exact species {{of which was}} not determined. After an hour's struggle, he was reportedly dragged up a tree, but then rescued by police and villagers after he was able <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> on his mobile phone. The snake was reportedly captured by police, but had escaped and disappeared by the next day. The man said he bit the snake's tail while he was being attacked and was injured on his lower lip because {{the tip of the}} tail was sharp.|$|E
25|$|The Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory, {{located at}} Fort Stanton, was opened in October 1974. It was there where {{preparations}} {{for a new}} museum building took place. In 1976, it suffered a fire after masonite sheets fell from a forklift, and into a container of lacquer thinner. Staff were unable <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> due to the fire damaging the phone lines. The damage cost approximately $75,000 {{and no one was}} injured. The museum became the first Smithsonian museum to use labels for the hearing impaired in their exhibitions, in 1980. An archives devoted to the area of Anacostia was created in 1977.|$|E

25|$|Another form {{of closed}} {{communication}} {{used in the}} books and movies {{is a set of}} mirrors which belonged to Sirius Black. Sirius gives Harry one mirror in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with a note explaining to Harry that Sirius and James Potter used to use the mirrors {{to talk to each other}} when they were put in separate detentions. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry uses a shard of his broken mirror <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from the Malfoy's cellar, and later finds out that Aberforth Dumbledore had been watching over Harry using Sirius' mirror, which he obtained from Mundungus Fletcher.|$|E
25|$|Ndonye accused {{five men}} of raping {{her on the}} morning of September 13, 2009.

She claimed she tried <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> not realizing all five men were together. The four of the five men were arrested, held on $350,000 bail, spent three days in jail under protective custody, and all charged with first-degree rape, which carries a possible 25 year sentence. Rondell Bedward was also suspended from Hofstra.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 1969, local {{merchants and}} {{residents}} held {{a meeting to}} discuss possible uses for the derelict site. At the time, student activist Wendy Schlesinger and Michael Delacour (a former defense contractor employee who had become an anti-war activist) had become attached to the area, {{as they had been}} using it as a rendez-vous for a secret romantic affair. The two presented a plan for developing the under-utilized, university-owned land into a public park. This plan was approved by the attendees, but not by the university. Stew Albert, a co-founder of the Yippie Party, agreed to write an article for the local counter-culture newspaper, the Berkeley Barb, {{on the subject of the}} park, particularly <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from local residents.|$|E
5000|$|Each hamlet {{was given}} a radio with which <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> South Vietnamese army ARVN support, but in fact ARVN forces were {{unreliable}} in responding <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> especially when attacks occurred after nightfall. The villagers were also given weapons and training, but were only expected to hold out until conventional reinforcements arrived. Once {{it became clear that}} ARVN could not be relied upon, many villagers proved unwilling to fight even small Vietcong detachments, which could then capture the villagers' weapons.
