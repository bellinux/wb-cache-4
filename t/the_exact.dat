40|$|Association rule mining {{has made}} many {{achievements}} {{in the area}} of knowledge discovery. However, the quality of the extracted association rules is a big concern. One problem with the quality of the extracted association rules is the huge size of the extracted rule set. As a matter of fact, very often tens of thousands of association rules are extracted among which many are redundant thus useless. Mining non-redundant rules is a promising approach to solve this problem. <b>The</b> Min-max <b>exact</b> basis proposed by Pasquier et al [Pasquier 05] has showed exciting results by generating only non-redundant rules. In this paper, we first propose a relaxing definition for redundancy under which <b>the</b> Min-max <b>exact</b> basis still contains redundant rules; then we propose a condensed representation called Reliable exact basis for <b>exact</b> association rules. <b>The</b> rules in <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis are not only non-redundant but also more succinct than the rules in Min-max exact basis. We prove that the redundancy eliminated by <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis does not reduce the belief to <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis. <b>The</b> size of <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis is much smaller than that of <b>the</b> Min-max <b>exact</b> basis. Moreover, <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis is a lossless representation of exact association rules since we prove that all exact association rules can be deduced from <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis. Experimental results show that <b>the</b> Reliable <b>exact</b> basis significantly reduces the number of the extracted rules...|$|R
