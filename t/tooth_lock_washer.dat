50|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{made for}} AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 {{inches in length}} and {{does not require a}} <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> for {{attachment}} to the barrel of an AR-15. The use of a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> or crush washer was rejected as their use can increase visible flash from the shooter's perspective. The Vortex is tightened by hand and repeated firing of the rifle causes the Vortex to tighten to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, {{and safety}} wire {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with thread-locking fluid to prevent loosening of bolted joints.|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the jamming purpose). Jam nuts, other types of locknuts, <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{apply the}} Junker Test {{to determine the}} point at which fastener securing elements - such as lock nuts, wedges and <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> - fail when subjected to vibration. The data collected by the test enables design engineers to specify fasteners that will perform under a wide range of conditions without loosening.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|R
2500|$|The Vortex Flash Hider is a flash {{suppressor}} made by Smith Enterprise {{and has been}} called the [...] "most effective flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. The Vortex made for AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches in length and does not require a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> for attachment to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The {{fastener}} {{serves the}} functions of both a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> and a nut. As the fastener is tightened in the nut the prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on {{the root of the}} thread on the fastener. When the fastener is tightened, the base of the nut, which is arched, elastically deforms and applies a force to the fastener, which locks it from loosening under vibrations.|$|R

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|R

This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator ?? robot finger that is used to recognize small objects by touch. The device incorporates a novel imaging tactile sensor ?? artificial skin with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a finger tip. The sensor is mounted on a tendon-actuated mechanical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger. A program controls the finger, using it to press and probe the object placed in front of it. Based on how the object feels, the program guesses its shape and orientation and then uses the finger to test and refine the hypothesis. The device is programmed to recognize commonly used fastening devices ??ts, bolts, flats, <b>washers,</b> <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> dowel pins, cotter pins and set screws...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R

50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated <b>lock</b> <b>washer)</b> that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|R
40|$|The enolase from Streptococcus pyogenes (Str enolase F 137 L/E 363 G) is a homo-octamer {{shaped like}} a donut. Plasminogen (Pgn) is a monomeric protein {{composed}} of seven discrete separated domains organized into a <b>lock</b> <b>washer.</b> The enolase is known to bind Pgn. In past work we searched for conditions {{in which the two}} proteins would bind to one another. The two native proteins in solution would not bind under any of the tried conditions. We found that if the structures were perturbed binding would occur. We stated that only the non-native Str enolase or Pgn would interact such that we could detect binding. We report here the results of a series of dual polarization interferometry (DPI) experiments coupled with atomic force microscopy (AFM), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and fluorescence. We show that the critical condition for forming stable complexes of the two native proteins involves Str enolase binding to a surface. Surfaces that attract Str enolase are a sufficient condition for binding Pgn. Under certain conditions, Pgn adsorbed to a surface will bind Str enolase...|$|R

As the escape wheel turns, the pallet is in just the right position to receive a push from an impulse tooth. Then the next <b>locking</b> <b>tooth</b> drops onto the ruby roller and stays there while the balance wheel completes its cycle and swings back clockwise (CW), and the process repeats. During the CW swing, the impulse tooth falls momentarily into the ruby roller notch again, but isn't released.|$|R
