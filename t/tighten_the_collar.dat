50|$|Martingale collars (also called limited-slip collars) {{are usually}} made of flat nylon {{with a smaller}} fixed-length section (made of either nylon or a short length of chain) that, when pulled on by the leash, shortens up <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> around <b>the</b> dog's neck, to a limited extent. When {{properly}} fitted, martingales are looser than flat-buckle collars when not tightened, and less severely corrective than slip collars when tightened.|$|R
60|$|And again, {{struggling}} frantically as <b>the</b> <b>tightening</b> <b>collar</b> {{shut off}} his wind, Ben Bolt was slowly lifted into the air. So wildly did he struggle that, ere his hind feet {{were off the}} floor, he pranced back and forth, {{so that when he}} was heaved clear his body swung like a huge pendulum. Over the chair, he was dropped, and for {{a fraction of a second}} the posture was his of a man sitting in a chair. Then he uttered a terrible cry and sprang.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} clutch uses a knurled collar partially threaded {{below the}} cymbal {{and a pair}} of knurled rings above it. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is <b>tightened</b> against <b>the</b> end of the thread, while <b>the</b> rings are <b>tightened</b> against each other.|$|R
5000|$|Martingale collars are {{recommended}} for Sighthounds because their heads {{are smaller than}} their necks and they can often slip out of standard collars. They can, however, be used for any breed of dog. Their no-slip feature has made them a safety standard at many kennels and animal shelters. A martingale collar has 2 loops; the smaller loop is the [...] "control loop" [...] that <b>tightens</b> <b>the</b> larger loop when pulled to prevent dogs from slipping out of <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> A correctly adjusted martingale does not constrict the dog's neck when pulled taut according to some who use them. Others use them fitted snugly {{to be able to}} use them in a similar manner to a choke chain but without the unlimited constriction of a choke chain. The structure allows <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> to be loose and comfortable, but <b>tightens</b> if <b>the</b> dog attempts to back out of it.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} <b>tightened</b> <b>the</b> {{fit of the}} ao dai {{to create}} the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> to <b>the</b> underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|R
40|$|The {{rubberized}} {{fuel tank}} {{was found to}} have failed in <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> band regions. <b>The</b> failure was by tensile tearing along the line joining the mounting holes. It appears most probable that improper <b>tightening</b> of <b>the</b> mounting brackets and/or nonconformities in the dimension of the rubberized fuel tank would have resulted in the tensile load in the mounting holes. No material abnormalities appear to be responsible for the failure...|$|R
50|$|In heraldry, {{most members}} of orders are {{permitted}} to display <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of their order on their coat of arms (if {{they are in fact}} entitled to wear <b>the</b> <b>collar).</b> There are often very strict rules as to how exactly <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> is to be displayed. Normally it will entirely encircle the escutcheon (shield), or <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> may be partially hidden by it. Sometimes, only a part of <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and <b>the</b> badge will extend below the escutcheon.|$|R
50|$|The highpoint hitch is very secure, since {{any load}} will <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> turns against each other, at <b>the</b> same time <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> {{grip on the}} working end.|$|R
50|$|Collar stays {{are removed}} from shirts before dry {{cleaning}} or pressing, as they could damage the shirt in the process, and then are replaced prior to wearing. Shirts that are press ironed with <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> stays are vulnerable to damage, as {{this results in a}} telltale impression of <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> stay in <b>the</b> fabric of <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> Some shirts have stays which are sewn into <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and are not removable.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is worn on {{designated}} collar days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> signifies <b>the</b> Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|R
40|$|Microscopic {{methods were}} used to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> unique <b>collar</b> structure of <b>the</b> gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacterium, strain DCB- 1. Polar cell growth apparently occurred from <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> When <b>the</b> daughter cell was approximately equal in length to the mother cell and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> was thus centrally located, cell division occurred within <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> region. Division was by a novel mechanism which conserved <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of <b>the</b> mother cell and {{gave rise to a}} new <b>collar</b> of <b>the</b> daughter cell. Cells of DCB- 1 were also found to contain stacked internal membranes and glycogen bodies...|$|R
50|$|When Loki told Odin of Freyja's collar, Odin {{asked him}} to fetch <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> or never to return, so Loki {{transformed}} himself into a fly and found a way into Freyja's bower. When he found her, he saw that she had <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> on and lay on her back. He turned into a flea and bit her whereupon she turned so he could unlock <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and steal it. Then he returned to Odin and gave him <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} {{generally}} attached to <b>the</b> pet's usual <b>collar</b> with strings or tabs passed through holes {{punched in the}} sides of the plastic. The neck of <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> should be short enough to let the animal eat and drink. Although most pets adjust to them quite well, others will not eat or drink with <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> in place and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> is temporarily removed for meals.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> is <b>the</b> {{insignia}} {{of office}} of the Grand Master of the order; the French president therefore wears <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of <b>the</b> Order of the Légion d'honneur. In other countries such as Brazil <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved {{for the president and}} foreign heads of state.|$|R

5|$|Knights and Ladies may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the circlet (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> of <b>the</b> Order; {{the former is}} shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter. The badge is depicted suspended from <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> <b>The</b> Royal Arms depict <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the circlet and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|Members of the {{paramount}} class of <b>the</b> Pearl <b>Collar</b> may encircle their arms with <b>the</b> <b>Collar</b> of <b>the</b> Order. If, for some exceptional reasons, the specific oval badge and riband of this grade are displayed instead of <b>the</b> <b>Collar,</b> a golden flame may be added above the badge.|$|R
2500|$|Chokuninkan had {{ornamentation}} at <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> back, chest, sleeves, sides, {{and small}} of the back. Sōninkan had decorations only at <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> sleeves, sides, and small of the back. Hanninkan had decorations only at <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and sleeves. Chokuninkan used embroidery in [...] at {{the rim of}} the ornamentation and the fringe of the coat. Sōninkan and hanninkan used plain solid lines in these areas.|$|R
50|$|NCOs (de: Unteroffiziere) wore {{standard}} enlisted collar patches {{but were}} distinguished by {{a strip of}} 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> except on <b>the</b> dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms (de: Ausgangsuniform/ Paradeuniform) encircled <b>the</b> <b>collar's</b> upper edge, <b>the</b> simpler NCO-Tressen on service - or field uniform encircled <b>the</b> <b>collar's</b> lower edge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> {{counties}} are <b>the</b> five counties of Illinois that border on Chicago's Cook County. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> counties (DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will) {{are tied to}} Chicago economically, but, like many suburban areas in the United States, have very different political leanings than does the core city. Chicago {{has long been a}} Democratic stronghold, and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> {{counties are}} known for being historically Republican strongholds.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{prisoner}} is {{fitted with}} a collar that functions as a life monitor, locator and stunner. The prisoners on death row receive poison injections through <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> and must consume a special antidote candy every three days. Their collars contain countdown timers that warn the wearer with blinking and beeping when time is running low. When the timer reaches zero, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> displays <b>the</b> word [...] "DEAD" [...] and the inmate immediately succumbs to the poison and dies. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> unlocks allowing it to be removed. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> can also be removed by key cards used by the prison guards.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>collar</b> is {{attached}} to the shirt by a pair of studs like those shown. The shirt has a tunic collar, a short upright band of fabric with a hole at the back and one on each side at the front. <b>The</b> stiff <b>collar</b> {{is attached}} at the back before the shirt is donned (and the tie placed under <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> for a turndown <b>collar),</b> then <b>the</b> shirt is put on, after which the front stud is pushed through <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> to fasten it.|$|R

2500|$|A {{horse collar}} {{is a part}} of a horse harness that is used to {{distribute}} the load around a horse's neck and shoulders when pulling a wagon or plough. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> often supports and pads a pair of curved metal or wooden pieces, called hames, to which the traces of the harness are attached. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> allows <b>the</b> horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially enabling the animal to push forward with its hindquarters into <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> If wearing a yoke or a breastcollar, the horse had to pull with its less-powerful shoulders. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> had another advantage over the yoke as it reduced pressure on the horse's windpipe.|$|R
50|$|A collar used {{on animals}} to study their {{behaviors}} indepth. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> were invented in 2014 by Christopher Wilmers and eco-physiologist Terrie Williams. <b>The</b> <b>collars</b> {{are able to}} give the GPS location of the animal wearing {{it as well as}} the speed and direction the animal moves the whole time it is wearing <b>the</b> <b>collar.</b> <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> also gives information on what types of movements the animal has made such as jumping, or just standing still. A company by the name of PetPace made a SMART collar for dogs which owners and vets can use to know when the dog is sick and how its body is reacting to its treatment.|$|R

50|$|The {{story begins}} when two Lyman siblings, Orban and Adara, accidentally revert a shapeshifted bird on an English moor {{back into a}} small Dorig. The Dorig is holding an exquisitely molded collar, which in Lyman and Dorig culture are used to store {{protective}} magic. When Orban tries to take <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> <b>the</b> Dorig says he {{is the son of}} the Dorig king, and will curse <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> before giving it up. Orban kills the Dorig and takes <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> anyway, and as the Dorig dies he binds a curse to <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> by <b>the</b> three Powers - the Old Power, the Middle Power and the New Power.|$|R
