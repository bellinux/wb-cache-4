60|$|After {{wandering}} to and fro, trying <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> courage {{enough to}} ask the conductor for a free ride, and failing in the effort because none of the train hands would give him an opportunity to speak with them, {{he sat down on}} a truck and mechanically plunged his hands in his pockets.|$|E
60|$|Except for {{one window}} the {{neighbouring}} houses were in darkness, and the lamps shone tip a silent street. There {{was a little}} rain in the air, and the muddy road was full of pebbles.

60|$|The shops {{had closed}} {{by the time}} he got into the street again, and he walked down and watched with much solemnity the {{reflection}} of the quay lamps in the dark water of the harbour.

60|$|One wolf, more gaunt {{and rugged}} and grey than the others, with black lips and red tongue and bloodshot eyes, moved about the circle uneasily {{as if trying}} <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> its craven spirit to the {{sticking}} point.

60|$|Hatherleigh {{got him to}} come, {{arranged}} a sort of meeting for him at Redmayne's rooms in King's, and was very proud and proprietorial. It failed to stir Cambridge at all profoundly. Beyond a futile attempt <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>up</b> Hatherleigh made by some inexpert duffers who used nails instead of screws and gimlets, there was no attempt to rag. Next day Chris Robinson went and spoke at Bennett Hall in Newnham College, and left Cambridge in the evening amidst the cheers of twenty men or so. Socialism was at such a low ebb politically in those days that it didn't even rouse men to opposition.|$|E
