Parameters were evaluated before and 30 days after the treatment. For standardized pressure, we used a pressure algometer. Results: Patients treated with decompression splints showed reductions in subjective pain and pain upon pressure on temporal, masseter and trapezius muscles, as well as increased mouth opening after the treatment. Patients treated with acupuncture showed pain reduction in the short term and improvements in all of the evaluated para- meters (stronger pressure was required to produce pain; mouth opening was improved).

Objective: To systematically review studies that investigated the effect of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on the pain levels in individuals with TMD. Material and Methods: The databases Scopus, embase, ebsco and PubMed were reviewed from January/ 2003 to October/ 2010 with the following keywords: laser therapy, low-level laser therapy, temporomandibular joint disorders, <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction <b>syndrome,</b> <b>temporomandibular</b> joint, temporomandibular, facial pain and arthralgia, with the inclusion criteria for intervention studies in humans. exclusion criteria adopted were intervention studies in animals, studies that were not written in english, Spanish or Portuguese, theses, monographs, and abstracts presented in scientific events. Results: After a careful review, 14 studies fit the criteria for inclusion, of which, 12 used a placebo group. As for the protocol for laser application, the energy density used ranged from 0. 9 to 105 J/cm², while the power density ranged from 9. 8 to 500 mW. The number of sessions varied from 1 to 20 and the frequency of applications ranged from daily for 10 days to 1 time per week for 4 weeks. A reduction in pain levels was reported in 13 studies, with 9 of these occurring only in the experimental group, and 4 studies reporting pain relief for both the experimental group and for the placebo. Conclusion: Most papers showed that LLLT seemed to be effective in reducing pain from TMD. However, the heterogeneity of the standardization regarding the parameters of laser calls for caution in interpretation of these results. Thus, it is necessary to conduct further research in order to obtain a consensus regarding the best application protocol for pain relief in patients with TMD...|$|R

The most common disorders involved in the differential diagnosis include bursts of headaches, dental pain, gaint cell arteritis, glossopharyngeal nerve neuralgia, intracranial tumour, migraine, multiple sclerosis, otoitis media, sinusitis and <b>temporomandibular</b> joint <b>syndrome.</b> The TN {{is by far the most}} frequently diagnosed form of neuralgia with mean incidence of 4 per 1, 00, 000 populations and mean age of 50 at the time of examination.

Method: Fifty-eight consecutively BPS outpatients were recruited from 2014 to 2016. They were submitted to Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB- 8 v) and visual analogic scale (VAS) for pain. We used a descriptive analysis (mean, standard deviation, range) and Spearman and Kendall test coefficient as correlation index. One-way ANOVA test was used for the comparison between groups. P-value less than 0. 05 were required for statistical significance. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to retrospectively analyze the association between the years of the disease and pathological values o of CSI. Results: The patients were observed after 13. 1 + 11. 0 years by the onset of The CSI score was 69. 7 + 15. 8. Resulting significantly lower in patients with BPS onset in the last year the correlation between CSI and the disease duration was significant. The number of previous investigations was 3. 7 + 2. 8 while the number of previous treatments for chronic pain was 5. 9 + 3. 1, resulting significantly related to CSI score. The OAB- 8 v was 21 + 7. 5 (range 2 - 34). The worsening of the symptoms related to the overactive bladder at OAB- 8 v was related to a greater CS. After 1, 5 years of the onset of the pain the CS show a progressive worsening. The mean number of other diseases (fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety or depression, migraine, neck injury, Panic Disorder Attack, chronic fatigue <b>syndrome,</b> <b>temporomandibular</b> joint <b>syndrome,</b> restless leg syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities) associated to CS was 2. 8 + 1. 9.

Moderate efficacy is shown for chronic low back pain, cancer-related pain, rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal disorders; data for essential hypertension are controversial. Variability of techniques, procedures, sampling problems, non-systematic make definitive conclusions difficult.

The association of the active relaxation technique facilitates generalization and self-control during stress situation and outside the training session. TR and BFB are effective for anxiety and somatic stress-related disorders, associated with coping and quality of life improvement and affordable costs; they are minimally invasive but needing an active participation in the treatment process. Some limits are responders' prediction, continuity of practice and limited effectiveness for depression disorders.

40|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) pain is {{frequent}} in {{the general}} population but its pathogenesis is only poorly understood. Many recent studies have emphasized the role of central nervous system pain processing abnormalities in FM, including central sensitization and inadequate pain inhibition. However, increasing evidence points towards peripheral tissues as relevant contributors of painful impulse input that might either initiate or maintain central sensitization, or both. It is well known that persistent or intense nociception can lead to neuroplastic changes in the spinal cord and brain, resulting in central sensitization and pain. This mechanism represents a hallmark of FM and many other chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel <b>syndrome,</b> <b>temporomandibular</b> disorder, migraine, and low back pain. Importantly, after central sensitization has been established only minimal nociceptive input is required for the maintenance of the chronic pain state. Additional factors, including pain related negative affect and poor sleep have been shown to significantly contribute to clinical FM pain. Better understanding of these mechanisms and their relationship to central sensitization and clinical pain will provide new approaches for the prevention and treatment of FM and other chronic pain syndromes...|$|R

30|$|Patient-reported outcome (PRO) {{measures}} (Garratt 2009) {{are commonly}} used to assess a patient’s symptoms or functional status. Although PRO are subjective, it can help clinicians better understand how a condition influences a patient’s capabilities or symptoms (Fayers and Machin 2013). Physical symptoms are often unexplained by a specific organic cause. In fact, no organic explanation {{can be found in}} 10  % of patients who report persisting physical symptoms (Rief et al. 2001). Furthermore, multiple somatic symptom occurrence is associated with higher rates of psychopathology and predict poorer treatment outcomes (Lydiard et al. 1993; Ahles et al. 1991). The phenomenon of central sensitization (CS) has been proposed to explain some incidents of “non-organic” symptoms. CS involves an abnormal increase of pain caused by neuronal hyperexcitability and dysfunction in descending and ascending pathways in the central nervous system (Kindler et al. 2011; Heinricher et al. 2009).
