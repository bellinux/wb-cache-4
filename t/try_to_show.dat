25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} fasting {{is more than}} abstaining from food and drink. Fasting also {{includes}} abstaining from any falsehood in speech and action, abstaining from any ignorant and indecent speech, and from arguing, fighting, and having lustful thoughts. Therefore, fasting strengthens control of impulses and helps develop good behavior. During the sacred month of Ramadan, believers strive to purify body and soul and increase their taqwa (good deeds and God-consciousness). This purification of body and soul harmonizes {{the inner and outer}} spheres of an individual. Muslims aim to improve their body by reducing food intake and maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Overindulgence in food is discouraged and eating only enough to silence the pain of hunger is encouraged. Muslims believe they should be active, tending to all their commitments and never falling short of any duty. On a moral level, believers strive to attain the most virtuous characteristics and apply them to their daily situations. They <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> compassion, generosity and mercy to others, exercise patience, and control their anger. In essence, Muslims are trying to improve what they believe to be good moral character and habits.|$|E

There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn." [...] Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying [...] "He was a nice boy. Too nice for this." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{track was}} refined with {{remixing}} and additional parts added on 20 January and 3 February. During the latter session, McCartney and Starr re-recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums, respectively. Starr later highlighted his fills on the song as typical of an approach whereby [...] "I {{try to become}} an instrument; play {{the mood of the}} song. For example, 'Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire,' – boom ba bom. I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that; the disenchanting mood." [...] As on the 1966 track [...] "Rain", music journalist Ben Edmonds recognises Starr's playing as reflective of his empathy with Lennon's songwriting. In Edmonds' description, the drumming on [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] "transcends timekeeping to embody psychedelic drift – mysterious, surprising, without losing sight of its rhythmic role".|$|E
500|$|As Steam {{has grown}} in popularity, many other {{competing}} services have been surfacing trying to emulate their success. The most notable major competitors are Electronic Arts' (EA) Origin service, Ubisoft's Uplay, Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net, and CD Projekt's GOG.com. Battle.net competes as a publisher exclusive platform, while GOG.com's catalog includes {{many of the same}} titles as Steam but offers them in a DRM-free platform. Upon launch of EA's Origin in 2011, several EA-published titles were no longer available for sale, and users feared that future EA titles would be limited to Origin's service. Newell expressed an interest in EA games returning to the Steam catalog though noted the situation was complicated. Newell stated [...] "We have to show EA it’s a smart decision to have EA games on Steam, and we’re going to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> them that." [...] Ubisoft still publishes their games on the Steam platform, however most games published since the launch of Uplay require this service to run after launching the game from Steam.|$|E
500|$|... "Speechless" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kitty Empire of The Observer gave a negative {{review of the}} song, noting that ballads are Gaga's [...] "weak point". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted similarities between the song and the music of Queen, adding, [...] "Although the resulting tune doesn't have the same driving oomph of a peak-era Queen number, the imitation is admirable if {{not just for the}} fact that it manages to rub shoulders with such sacred company without once feeling like a gimmick." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song the lone [...] "dud" [...] from The Fame Monster, [...] "not because it's a bad song or poorly performed, but because, like on The Fame, when [...] does <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her softer side, it comes off as a fraud—at least alongside the rest of her material." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song had a [...] "galvanized Eurotrash finish" [...] to it, comparing the guitar playing in the song to the work of Noel Gallagher, the lead guitarist of Oasis.|$|E

500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that he knew what he was doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E

2500|$|Philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas and Hegel are {{sometimes}} {{said to have}} argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel, [...] "...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; {{that the history of}} the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lars Bo Jensen {{has criticized}} the Hans Christian Andersen/Jenny Lind theory: [...] "...to judge Andersen from a biographical {{point of view}} only is to reduce great and {{challenging}} literature to casebook notes. Thus it is a pity to regard [...] "The Nightingale" [...] as simply the story of Andersen's passion for the singer Jenny Lind, when it is equally important {{to focus on what}} the tale says about art, love, nature, being, life, and death, or on the uniquely beautiful and highly original way in which these issues are treated. Andersen's works are great, but it has become customary to make them seem small. It has been and still is the task of interpreters of Hans Christian Andersen's life and work to adjust this picture and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> him as a thinking poet." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{enormous}} {{success of the}} [...] "Swell Guys" [...] and [...] "P. E.

2500|$|Tarkan {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with a French model in the early 1990s, and with a Turkish journalist between 1994 and 1996. Because Tarkan does not like to talk about his personal life, there has been speculation about his sexual orientation in the popular press. Photos stolen from his house in New York in 2001 were portrayed as compromising; they were photos with other men in swimwear at a public nude beach. In one of the pictures he appears to be kissing a man. In an interview with Hürriyet, Tarkan contested the widespread assumption that he was gay. He said: [...] "Men ! Definitely. It's because I destroy [...] they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off as manhood!" [...] One of his ex-girlfriends also denied he was gay. Tarkan later gave fewer and fewer interviews and television appearances, limiting himself to a small number of trusted journalists. In 2006, he said that his relationship with the media had gone wrong.|$|E

[...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
