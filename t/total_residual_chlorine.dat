PUB has collaborated with Sandia National Laboratories ([URL] to develop CANARY (EPA 2010), a water quality event detection tool, in the distribution network. Several change detection algorithms are included within CANARY: a linear filter, a multivariate nearest-neighbour algorithm, and a set-point proximity algorithm. These algorithms identify a background water quality signature for each sensor and compare each new measurement to that background {{to determine if the}} new measurement is anomalous (EPA 2010). The development and deployment of a sub-zoning software tool is used to help to simplify the distribution network structure by organizing the water consumers in (virtual) sub-zones/clusters. This simplified tree-like cluster graph will improve the understanding of how water quality parameters such as <b>total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> levels and water age are affected by the network topology.|$|E

40|$|Nitrite in {{drinking}} water is a potential health hazard and monitoring its concentrations in distributed water is of paramount importance. When monochloramine is used in secondary disinfection {{in drinking}} water distribution systems (DWDSs), nitrite is often formed by nitrification in the biofilm on the inner surface of distribution pipes.

Nitrification was found to occur throughout the study area, though nitrite was not increased everywhere. Instead, nitrite was increased close to the water treatment plants (WTPs) and was connected to fresh drinking water than stagnant drinking water.

In addition, he also has used coliform organisms as an indicator of the bacteriological quali ty of the chlorinated water he has produced. Yet never, in all these years of water treatment practices, has there been reported a study of the correlation of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> found in the water of the distribution systems with the bacteriological quality of the water based on the coliform indicator organisms. In this study, data were collected from seven cities throughout the country. In addition to the results of the coliform tests, the data included the results of <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> determinations made at the time bacteriological samples were taken.

The results of the analyses show conclusively that a mathemat ically definable relationship does exist between <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> and coliform density in water distribution systems. It is also shown that regardless of the <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> maintained in a water distribu tion system, at least 0. 45 percent of all coliform tubes examined will show a positive presence of these organisms.

40|$|A {{critical}} component in commercial poultry production {{is to ensure}} birds are provided clean, quality water. Multiple disinfectants can be utilized to optimize a good water quality program. The goal of these water disinfectants is to greatly reduce or eliminate the presence of all bacteria. In recent years, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) meter has been a tool utilized by the poultry industry to monitor chlorine efficacy in drinking water. An ORP reading of 650 - 750 millivolts (mV) has become the industry standard for assuring an acceptable sanitizing <b>residual</b> of free <b>chlorine</b> is present for controlling microbial contamination regardless of the actual amount of total or free chlorine or the water pH. A recent bench top evaluation of a new chlorine product revealed microbial contamination even when the oxidation-reduction potential read 650 mV. Given these results, it is beneficial for the poultry industry to re-evaluate the relationship between <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP value, and microbial levels. Additionally, the study determined if a new ORP standard should be the target and if this standard consistently correlates to free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (ppm) even under scenarios of different water quality parameters. This study evaluated the efficacy of two different forms of chlorine, a liquid product (sodium hypochlorite) and a crystalline dry product (sodium dichloro-S-triazinetrione) at three concentrations (2, 4, and 8 oz/gal) commonly used for drinking water sanitation in the poultry industry. The objective {{was to determine the}} relationship between <b>total</b> and free <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP, pH, and microbial content of the water when the chlorine products are utilized in water with a high microbial level typically found in unclean poultry drinking water lines. Results indicated both forms of chlorine were effective disinfectants for reducing aerobic bacteria present in the water.

Fourbioassayswerealsoconductedonrepresenta- tive organisms of surface aquatic systems (Pimephales promelas, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analytical data did not reveal any ecotoxicological risk for St. Lawrence River organisms, mainly due to strong effluent dilution. However, the substance approach showed that, because of their contribution to the ecotoxicological hazard posed by the effluent, total phospho- rus (Ptot), aluminum (Al), <b>total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine,</b> chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), pyrene, ammonia (N–NH 4 +), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) require more targeted monitoring. While chronic ecotoxicity tests revealed a potential impact of CSO dis- charges on P. promelas and C. dubia, acute toxicity tests did not show any effect on D. magna or O. mykiss, thus underscoring the importance of chronic toxicity tests as part of efforts aimed at characterizing effluent toxicity. Ultimately, the study leads to the conclusion that the coupled “substance and bioassay” approach is a reliable and robust method for assessing the ecotoxicological risk associated with complex discharges such as CSOs...|$|E

Since {{the opening of}} Lake Reality (LR) in 1988, total numbers of fish inhabiting upper EFPC have increased. However, species diversity has remained poor. Water quality data have been collected in upper EFPC during the time period covered in this report. <b>Total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> (TRC) levels have exceeded federal and state water quality criteria over the years. However, with the installation of two dechlorination systems in late 1992, TRC levels have been substantially lowered in most portions of upper EFPC. By June 1993, concentrations of TRC were 0. 04 to 0. 06 mg/L at the north-south pipes (NSP) and below detection limits at sampling station AS- 8 and were 0 to 0. 01 mg/L at the inlet and outlet of LR.

30|$|Many {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} for ballast water treatment and fall into two broad categories: in-line and in-tank. In-line systems operate so that water is pumped from the sea to the ballast tanks routed through a processing system which kills organisms before they reach the ballast tank. In-tank systems kill the organisms after the ballast tanks are filled with seawater from the port. These are reasonably considered batch process systems. These systems treat water in the ballast tanks rather than during intake or discharge. Treatment of the ballast water can occur en route between ballast water operations and this is the principal advantage of in-tank systems. Different {{technologies have}} been suggested for ballast water treatment, such as disinfection with chlorine (Simpson 2001), injecting chemicals (La Carbona et al. 2010), adding biocides to ballast water for the neutralisation of harmful microorganisms (Chelossi and Faimali 2006), sterilisation with ozone (Perrins et al. 2006), filtration with UV (ultraviolet) light (Sutherland et al. 2013), exposure to electrochemical charge or electro-ionization (Aliotta et al. 2001), exposure to heat (Mountfort et al. 2001), and sonication (Gavand et al. 2007). Some suggested systems use acids, while others sterilisation with hydrogen peroxide (Smit et al. 2008). The deoxygenation system (Browning 2001) kills organisms in the ballast tanks by creating a water environment (inert gas + CO 2) which is low in oxygen, higher than normal in CO 2, and with a lower than normal seawater pH. Some systems employ multiple methods to increase effectiveness. The 2  × filtration + peracetic acid system utilises the method of passing the ballast water through the filters and adding peracetic acid. The filtration + electrolysis + ultraviolet light system provides the method of killing plants, bacteria and animals passing the ballast water through the filter and exposing them to electrolysis and ultraviolet light (Sutherland et al. 2013). The electrolysis system conducts sterilisation passing the ballast water through the filter with electrolysis (Rigby and Taylor 2001). The filtration with electrolysis, electrochlorination and waste control system uses the electrolysis method, injecting chlorine to induct a electrochemical reaction and removing the waste depending on the water quality. For this system, current density is an important parameter effecting the production of <b>total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in ballast or brackish water. Low current densities can avoid the production of harmful chlorine species (Lacasa et al. 2013).|$|E

GSI test protocols {{are consistent with the}} requirements of the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (International Maritime Organization, 2004). GSI procedures, methods materials and findings are publicly accessible on the GSI website (www. greatshipsinitiave. org). In August through October 2009, the GSI conducted land-based tests on the SiCURETM Ballast Water Management System in cooperation with German Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH), i. e., the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency. During the series of five consecutive valid trials, the SiCURETM Ballast Water Management System was evaluated for its ability to: (a) successfully treat ballast water without interruption, (b) meet IMO D- 2 discharge standards after a five-day holding time, and (c) discharge water after the five day retention period that is environmentally benign (i. e., no residual toxicity) pursuant to United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality criteria. It should be noted that because freshwater zooplankton are in general smaller than their salt and brackish water counterparts, the larger regulated size category (greater than 50 μm in minimum dimension) did not incorporate all live zooplankton that were present in the source water assemblage. The Siemens SiCURETM Ballast Water Management System functioned properly during the five consecutive trials, and was highly effective at reducing live organism densities in the fresh water ambient conditions of Duluth-Superior Harbor, as amended in these tests to achieve IMOconsistent challenge conditions. Live organisms in the regulated size classes were discharged in densities below the IMO D- 2 standard. Microbial analyses showed system performance in keeping with IMO requirements for bacteria. Chemistry data generated across trials indicated the post-retention discharge to have well less than 0. 1 mg/L <b>total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> (TRC) under ambient conditions. Ambient water collected immediately after treatment and held in a cold environment had TRC and total residual oxidant (TRO) levels which slightly exceeded this level. However, in a real world application, the intake water would also be cold, and developers claim that the test system is designed to respond to this circumstance (reflected in oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP) with a reduction in chlorine generated and injected into the intake stream. There were no acute toxic effects of treated discharge on any test species across assays and trials. Chronic toxicity effects in 100 % effluent were detected in one out of two trials for test species of zooplankton and phytoplankton.

40|$|Inclui artigo publicado em: Proceedings of the 4 th International Conference of Swimming Pool & SPA(ICOEH), 2011, Porto: 40 - 50 The {{presence}} of water disinfection by-products (DBPs) in swimming pools constitutes today {{a public health}} concern, particularly because swimming is an activity used by {{a high percentage of}} the population, namely elderly and young children. Moreover, several adverse short-term and long-term health effects have been associated with these compounds (Lakind et al., 2010; Zwiener et al., 2007). Water disinfection methods are used in all swimming pools, namely in public pools, to ensure an adequate and effective protection of users against microbiological pathogens. Chlorination is the most common disinfection method used worldwide, because it is low cost, easy to use, efficient against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, and enables the maintenance of a residual protection. The use of chlorine based treatment techniques has one strong drawback, which is the generation of several DBPs, potentially harmful products, that can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation and absorption through the skin (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2009; Caro and Gallego, 2007). DBPs comprise several compounds that are formed through the reaction of chlorine with organic matter present in water. Amongst DBPs, the most relevant and better characterized are trihalomethanes (THMs) : chloroform (CF), bromoform (BF), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), and chlorodibromomethane (DBCM). These compounds have been associated with health effects such as respiratory, ocular and cutaneous symptoms and also with some long-term health effects such as bladder cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes (Lee et al., 2009; Zwiener et al., 2007). Accurate exposure assessments to THMs in indoor pool environment is particularly difficult because their formation depends on many factors such as water and air temperature (Tw and Tair), humidity (Hu), pH, free residual chlorine (FrCl), total organic content and number of pool users (Lee et al., 2009). In Portugal a specific legislation to assess the quality of swimming pool waters is inexistent. The guideline value used in this study for total THMs (TTHMs) was the one established in the Portuguese Law 306 / 2007, for drinking water quality - 100 μg/L. Some other water parameters determined in swimming pools such as Tw turbidity (Turb), pH, FrCl, <b>total</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine,</b> conductivity (Cond), permanganate index (COD) and isocyanuric acid were assessed by Portuguese Law 5 / 97, regarding technical and safety conditions of closed environments with water diversions. WHO guidelines for safe recreational water environments (2006) were also used to assess some water and air parameters in pools. Standard 62. 1 (2006) from American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASRHAE) was also used to assess pool air parameters. The main goal of this investigation project was to study the occurrence, distribution and determinants of THMs in indoor swimming pools. This will enable an evaluation of swimming pool users’ exposure to THMs. In order to achieve this goal, the characterization of water quality of 30 Lisbon indoor swimming pools, using chorine based treatment techniques, was made during a six month period. Because of laboratory working restrictions, CF concentration in pool air was studied only in 6 swimming pools, at the same period. Several parameters such as TTHMs concentration, CF, BDCM, DBCM, BF concentration in water, FrCl, combined residual chlorine (CrCl), pH, Tw and Tair, Hu, COD, Cond, Turb and chloride (Cl) were determined in each pool, once a month. THMs water sampling was made in duplicates in two pool water spots, physicochemical parameters were determined in one of the THMs water sampling spots and THMs air sampling was made in two pool spots, considered to be representative of the swimming pool air. All sampling procedures were performed by specialized sampling technicians from Lisbon Health Centres Group (ACES). Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17. 0 software. Descriptive analysis was applied to all variables in order to determine mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare numerical variables and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used to examine correlation between all environmental parameters. TTHMs water level ranged from 10 to 160 μg/L, while CF water level typically ranged from 5 to 150 μg/L, with occasional higher levels detected. Regarding other THMs levels in pool water, BDCM ranged from 0. 5 to 15 μg/L, DBCM from 0. 4 to 10 μg/L and BF was obtained in concentrations less than 2 μg/L. Moreover, in some pools, DBCM and BF were not detected. From these results, it can be concluded that there was a large variation in TTHMs and CF water levels between the pools and that CF was the THM obtained in higher concentrations. These results are in agreement with studies presented by other authors (Lee et al., 2009; Chu and Nieuwenhuijsen, 2002). In air, CF level ranged from 40 to 200 μg/m 3, with occasional higher levels detected. Tw presented less variation (27 to 31 ºC) than Tair (21 to 33 ºC), although sporadic higher values were found. FrCl and Cond presented higher values than the guidelines from DR 5 / 97 only in a small number of pools. Turb and COD values were within the guidelines from DR 5 / 97. pH varied from 7 to 8. 5, with {{only a small number of}} pools having values higher than 7. 8. As referred in WHO guidelines, pH should be maintained between 7. 2 and 7. 8 for chlorine disinfectants to ensure efficient disinfection. Using the statistical tests mentioned before, it was possible to obtain some interesting results. There was a clear positive linear correlation between CF water concentration (CFW) and TTHMs water concentration (R> 0. 98, p 0. 78, p 0. 45, p< 0. 05). These results are in agreement with Lee et al. (2009) which obtained positive linear correlations between CFW and COD and with Chu and Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) which also obtained correlations between TTHMs water concentration and Tw. In conclusion, there appears to be good water and air quality in the studied Lisbon swimming pools. Regarding THMs levels in water, some pools presented high TTHMs and CF concentrations. Moreover, CF air concentrations were also high in some swimming pools. These results clearly demonstrate that THMs monitoring is particularly important and that, in a near future, this should be extended to other DBPs. Furthermore, for a correct and conscious use of swimming pools, appropriate and targeted information about safe practices should be provided to pool users.

40|$|Background: Legionella is a gram negative, aerobic, and sporeless {{bacterium}} {{which is}} readily found in ventilation systems, cooling towers, hot water distribution systems, bathrooms, swimming pools, and fountains. Legionella is {{implicated in the}} legionnaires’ and Pontiac fever diseases. Hospitals are common habitats for the bacterium, where the bacterial growths are amply found and that provide the most likely places for susceptible people to contract the diseases. Given the importance of hospitals in this regard, this survey {{was carried out in}} a General Hospital in Isfahan. Methods: For the purposes of this study, a total of 30 samples were taken according to standard methods from hot water distribution system at various points in the kitchen, the bathrooms, the internal distribution system, and the cooling towers (8, 8, 8, and 6 samples, respectively). After that temperature, pH, and <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> of samples were determined, the samples were transferred to lab where they were inoculated on a base medium of BCYE-a and two selective media of GPVA and CCVC. The plates were then incubated at a temperature of 37 °C and a humidity of 90 %. The colonies were then identified and counted. Results: The tests showed that 11 from the total 30 samples were contaminated with Legionella, accounting for 36. 6 % of the samples. The numbers of Legionella positive samples from the kitchens, bathrooms, internal distribution system, and cooling tower were 4, 3, 3, and 1, respectively. From the total 30 heat and acid pretreated samples inoculated on base and selective media, 36. 6 % were Legionella positive while from the untreated samples, 6 % grew on the base medium and 23 % on selective media. <b>Total</b> mean of <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> was 0. 25 mg/l, pH= 7. 6, and average temperature was 31. 1 °C. The results of biochemical tests Blood agar, Catalz, Urea agar, Gelatin agar, Motility, and gram staining were −, +, −, +, +, and −, respectively. In addition to these tests, Legionella colonies were grown by Direct Fluorescent Antibody, confirming their presence. Conclusion: The results indicate that temperature is a critical factor in Legionella sp. ’s proliferation. An average 0. 25 mg/l of <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> showed to have no effect on disinfecting the bacterium. Heat pretreatment proved to be more effective than the acidic one in removing nuisance factors and, finally, bacterial growth was higher on the selective media than on the base medium.

This study was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} turbidity, <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration and microbial quality of water used for drinking in rural areas of Kashan. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on drinking water samples taken from 57 villages of Kashan during 2008 - 9. Among the total samples taken during three stages, only one sample was selected and analyzed for water quality parameters of turbidity, <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration and heterotrophic plate count (HPC). Results: HPC, <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration and turbidity of water samples desirable in three stages and undesirable in another three stages were 86, 22. 8 and 75. 4 12. 3, 29. 8 and 0, respectively. Furthermore, HPC in 95 of samples under the supervision of rural water and wastewater company (RWWC) and in 64. 7 of samples that were not under the supervision of RWWC, were in the range of standard drinking water. Conclusion: The results of the study show that correlation between <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration and HPC level of drinking water in Kashan rural areas was significant, while there is no significant correlation between <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration and turbidity HPC and turbidity. Hence, RWWC supervision has a prominent role in supplying safe drinking water for such areas...|$|R
