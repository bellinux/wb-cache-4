5|$|Opposition to class, {{death and}} its impacts, {{experiencing}} adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant {{themes of the}} series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to <b>the</b> <b>lowly,</b> non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of the}} social order, yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E

5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Eddie Gottlieb {{sold the}} Warriors {{franchise}} for $850,000 (equal to about $ today) {{to a group}} of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco, and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach, Bob Feerick. This also meant, however, that the team broke apart, as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, and Tom Gola was homesick, requesting a trade to <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> New York Knicks halfway through the season. With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year. Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|From 1947 to 1948 Davis was an {{assistant}} history master at Christ's Hospital, Horsham, as a junior colleague of David Roberts. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> nature of this post was an expression of prejudice against conscientious objectors. Anyway, during that year he learnt {{that he was a}} born teacher, even a quintessential schoolmaster.|$|E
25|$|Open table {{fellowship}} with outsiders {{was central}} to Jesus' ministry. His practice of eating with <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> people that he healed defied the expectations of traditional Jewish society. He presumably taught at the meal, {{as would be expected}} in a symposium. His conduct caused enough of a scandal that he was accused of being a glutton and a drunk.|$|E

25|$|Bromberg's most {{outstanding}} attribute was his facility with sensitive character roles; {{he could take}} a standard, undistinguished supporting part and make it unforgettably sympathetic. In Hollywood Cavalcade he portrays Don Ameche's friend who knows he will never get the girl; in Three Sons he is <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> business associate who longs {{to be given a}} partnership; in Easy to Look At he is the once-great couturier now reduced to night watchman.|$|E
25|$|The {{stereotype}} {{among most}} Chinese in Canton that all Tanka women were prostitutes was common, leading the government during the Republican era to accidentally inflate {{the number of}} prostitutes when counting, due to all Tanka women being included. The Tanka women were viewed as such that their prostitution activities were {{considered part of the}} normal bustle of a commercial trading city. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> regarded Tanka prostitutes managed to elevate themselves into higher forms of prostitution.|$|E
25|$|Baden-Powell {{was further}} sidelined from active command {{and given the}} role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force. He {{returned}} to England {{to take up a}} post as Inspector General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding this position, Baden-Powell was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving the force an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals. In 1907 he was promoted to Lt. General but left on the inactive list. Eventually he was appointed to <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Force.|$|E

25|$|Just {{one year}} after, Caragiale was {{moved back to}} Wallachia, {{becoming}} inspector general in Argeş and Vâlcea. He was ultimately stripped of this position in 1884, and found himself {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; he thus accepted <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> position of clerk for the civil registry administration. It is probably during this period that his melodrama O soacră was written and published—Caragiale, who was aware of its faults, indicated that it was a work from his youth, and dated it to 1876. His account is challenged by several details in the text.|$|E
25|$|Material {{prosperity}} at {{the start}} of 19th century produced an enlightened middle class in the Philippines, consisting of well-to-do farmers, teachers, lawyers, physicians, writers, and government employees. Many of them were able to buy and read books originally withheld from <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> Filipino class. They discussed political problems and sought government reforms, and eventually, they were able {{to send their children to}} colleges and universities in Manila and abroad, particularly to Madrid. The material progress was primarily due to the opening of the Manila ports to world trade.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} from playing, Reedman was appointed coach of <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> West Adelaide Football Club in 1908. To {{the end of}} 1907, West Adelaide had won only 23 and drawn 1 of the 145 SAFA matches they had played, and had been perennially close to or {{on the bottom of}} the ladder. Reedman coached West Adelaide to its first ever premiership in 1908, and then defeated Victorian Football League (VFL) champions Carlton Football Club to become Champions of Australia. Reedman promptly left West Adelaide to return to North Adelaide for one last season as a player, but it was an inauspicious finale, as the red and whites finished second last.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Ivan Zholtovsky, who abstained from <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> work on subway stations, Fomin eagerly {{joined the}} contest for the Metro. He competed on the Krasniye Vorota (Red Gates) against former constructivist Ilya Golosov, whose entry {{appeared}} to be a true Doric Greek classic. Unfortunately for Golosov, extremely hard geological conditions required heavy, wide support pylons. His otherwise fine draft was not feasible for 1935 technology, giving way to Fomin's simple red granite design - a tribute to the old Red Gates, demolished in 1932. This station opened to public in 1935, while Fomin was alive. He designed one more station, Teatralnaya (then Ploschad Sverdlova), which was completed two years after his death.|$|E
25|$|Henry felt {{he needed}} to obtain a papal {{imperial}} coronation, partly because of <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> origins of his house, {{and partly because of}} the concessions he had been forced to make to obtain the German crown in the first place. He also saw it, together with the crowns of Italy and Arles, as a necessary counterweight to the ambitions of the French king. To ensure the success of his Italian expedition, Henry entered into negotiations with Robert, King of Naples in mid-1310, with the intent of marrying his daughter, Beatrix to Robert’s son, Charles, Duke of Calabria. It was hoped that this would lessen the tensions in Italy between the anti-imperial Guelphs, who looked to the King of Naples for leadership, and the pro-imperial Ghibellines. Negotiations broke down due to Robert’s excessive monetary demands, as well as through the interference of Philip, who did not want such an alliance to succeed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1991, new coach Ray Handley made a {{decision}} regarding his quarterbacks. Instead of giving the starting job back to the now-healthy Simms, the coach held an open competition that Hostetler would ultimately win. He then led the Giants to victory in the season opener against the 49ers at home, snapping their NFL-record 18 game road winning streak. In his twelfth start against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hostetler broke his back and missed {{the rest of the}} season. Of the games Hostetler started (including the one he didn't finish), the Giants went 7-5. Simms, meanwhile, lost his first three starts against <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> Cincinnati Bengals (who won only three times that year), the Philadelphia Eagles (a loss which eliminated the Giants from playoff contention), and the eventual Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins. The Giants managed to win their final matchup against the Houston Oilers to finish 8-8. Hostetler finished the season winning 6 of his 12 starts.|$|E

25|$|Compared to the 2011–12 {{team that}} {{finished}} 41–25, the Lakers offense had improved in points per 100 possessions (108.3 vs. 106.0), but their defense underperformed. The team was lacking continuity with the projected starting lineup {{at the beginning}} of the season having played just 117 minutes together, primarily due to injuries. Howard returned the following game as the Lakers won their first game of 2013, stopping their losing streak at six with a 113-93 win over <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> Cleveland Cavaliers (9–30). In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups. In addition to his leg injury, World Peace also suffered an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. Things got so bad, D'Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead.|$|E
25|$|After being {{bothered by}} {{tendinitis}} in both knees since training camp, Gasol missed the next game. He was struggling after seven games under D'Antoni, averaging 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting 38.8 percent, {{and he was}} benched {{in the fourth quarter}} in multiple games. The Lakers lost 116–107 to the Knicks in D'Antoni's first game back to New York since he left the previous season. The Lakers allowed another big quarter as they trailed 41–27 in the first quarter. Bryant scored 31, but Los Angeles fell to 1–11 when he scored 30+ points, 1–5 without Gasol, and 4–9 overall under D'Antoni. Gasol returned after an eight-game absence, contributing 10 points, nine rebounds and five assists in a 101–100 win over <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> Charlotte Bobcats. The Lakers overcame an 18-point deficit for their third win in a row, {{only the second time in}} the season the streak had been achieved. Nash started against the Golden State Warriors after missing 24 games, and he had 12 points and nine assists in a 118–115 overtime road victory. The team was 12–12 during his absence, and won three of their first four games after his return.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity through which we have just passed has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds <b>the</b> <b>lowly</b> to the humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for better things.|$|E
