5|$|The uninfected {{workers are}} sent {{down to the}} {{warehouse}} to avoid contracting lice. Darryl had recently manipulated the warehouse foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan) into breaking up with him {{because he wanted to}} have a new start when he moves to Philadelphia for his job at Jim's new sports marketing company. Darryl tells the others about this so that they will be careful what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Val. Nellie, Phyllis, and Kevin confront Val and try to convince her to take Darryl back, to no avail. However, when Kevin then tries to get a date with Val, she is so mortified at her apparent dating prospects that she decides to get back together with Darryl, much to his annoyance.|$|E

From a note found among the clothing of the murdered, the Sobibor prisoners learned that {{those who had been}} killed were from work groups in the Bełżec camp. The note said: [...] "We worked for a year in Belzec. I don't know where they're taking us now. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Germany. In the freight cars there are dining tables. We received bread for three days, and tins and liquor. If all this is a lie, then know that death awaits you too. Don't trust the Germans. Avenge our blood!" ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is because}} of Christians' past sins against Palestinians and Jews, the {{document}} continues, that Kairos USA {{has an obligation to}} “work and even suffer for peace, filled with a heart of love for both Israelis and Palestinians.” It acknowledges that by opposing Israeli policy, the members of Kairos USA expose themselves “to the charge of anti-Semitism” and risk losing Jewish friends. But they are willing, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> take this risk in order to “follow Jesus’ path of love and forgiveness as the way to justice and peace.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Georgiana's nephew once {{remarked that}} she thought of {{politics}} and [...] "nothing else", while her sister cared little for it. In 1838, Lady Carlisle articulated a negative opinion of Charles Dickens, who was then emerging as a successful author. [...] "I know there are such unfortunate beings as pickpockets and streetwalkers. I am very sorry for it and am very much shocked at their mode of life, but I own I do not much wish to hear what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> one another", she said. Historian Judith Lewis cites this opinion {{as evidence of the}} prevalence of class consciousness during the 19th-century, as Lady Carlisle was [...] "one of the more inoffensive of the grand dames of her time".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a paradox}} that haunts these charges of anti-Semitism. On the one hand, Rosenfeld, Harris, and others want {{to deny that}} American Jews and American Jewish {{organizations}} like AIPAC [...] suffer from dual loyalty in trying to influence U.S. foreign policy. It's anti-Semitic or contributes to anti-Semitism, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> make that charge. On the other hand, they want to demand of American Jewish intellectuals a certain loyalty to Israel, Israeli policies, and to Zionism {{as part of their}} being Jewish. They make dual loyalty an inescapable part of being Jewish {{in a world in which}} a Jewish state exists. And that's probably the case. Many Jews now suffer from dual loyalty – the same way that Cuban-Americans or Mexican-Americans do. By ignoring this dilemma – and, worse still, by charging those who acknowledge its existence with anti-Semitism – the critics of the new anti-Semitism are engaged in a flight from their own political selves.|$|E
