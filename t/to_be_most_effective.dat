5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E

Cervical cancer screening, such as with the Papanicolaou test (pap) or looking at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect early cancer or abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. This allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number and deaths from cervical cancer in the developed world.|$|E

25|$|A different, and {{sometimes}} less time consuming {{option for the}} control of kudzu is chemical treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are Tordon and Triclopyr and the most effective are Picloram and Tebuthiuron. However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre). Herbicides are found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when they are used during the typical growing season, June–October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw {{a significant decrease in}} the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E

25|$|Removal of copyrighted {{content from}} the entire Usenet network is a nearly {{impossible}} task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special post cancellation message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore cancel messages by standard policy, {{because they can be}} easily falsified and submitted by anyone. For a takedown petition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> across the whole network, {{it would have to be}} issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.|$|E
25|$|Leader-focused {{approaches}} look to organizational {{leaders to}} determine the characteristics of effective leadership. According to the trait approach, more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach {{is being used to}} predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive. Another leader-focused approached is the behavioral approach which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) consideration; and (2) initiating structure. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is power and influence. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power, and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, consultation, ingratiation, exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.|$|E

500|$|Insects are swept {{along by}} the {{prevailing}} winds, while birds follow their own course. As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] In the Great Plains, wind erosion of agricultural land is a significant problem, and is mainly driven by the prevailing wind. [...] Because of this, wind barrier strips {{have been developed to}} minimize this type of erosion. [...] The strips can be in the form of soil ridges, crop strips, crops rows, or trees which act as wind breaks. [...] They are oriented perpendicular to the wind in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective.</b> [...] In regions with minimal vegetation, such as coastal and desert areas, transverse sand dunes orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, while longitudinal dunes orient themselves parallel to the prevailing winds.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{preventive}} vaccines {{protect against}} the two HPV types (16 and 18) that cause about 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.

[...] Vaccines that protect against more of the types common in cancers would prevent more cancers, and be less subject to regional variation. [...] For instance, a vaccine against the seven types most common in cervical cancers (16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58) would prevent an estimated 87% of cervical cancers worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Cochlear {{implants}} for congenitally deaf {{children are}} considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when implanted {{at a young}} age, during the critical {{period in which the}} brain is still learning to interpret sound. Hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves, on the assumption that deafness is a disability. Deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child's identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language, and claim that measuring the child's success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor self-image as [...] "disabled" [...] (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly deaf person.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In The Child and the Curriculum (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, [...] "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" [...] (1902, p.13). He argues {{that in order for}} education <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.|$|E
