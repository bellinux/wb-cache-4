In {{support of this}} position, he argued that India has good strategic reasons <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> nuclear deterrent, especially in order to balance against China and Pakistan, guaranteeing regional stability. He also criticized United States counter-proliferation policy towards India, which he considered unrealistic and harmful to American interests in the region.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{believed}} {{that there was a}} moderate faction in the Islamic republic headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful speaker of the Majlis who was seen as a leading potential successor to Khomeini and who was alleged <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> rapprochement with the United States. The Americans {{believed that}} Rafsanjani had the power to order Hezbollah to free the American hostages and establishing a relationship with him [...] by selling Iran arms would ultimately place Iran back within the American sphere of influence. It remains unclear if Rafsanjani really wanted a rapprochement with the United States or was just deceiving Reagan administration officials who were willing to believe that he was a moderate who would effect a rapprochement. Rafsanjani, whose nickname is [...] "the Shark" [...] was described by the British journalist Patrick Brogan as a man of great charm and formidable intelligence known for his subtlety and ruthlessness whose motives in the Iran–Contra affair remain completely mysterious. The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high level approval from the United States government, and when McFarlane convinced them that the U.S. government approved the sale, Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms.|$|E

He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her {{brilliant}} {{portrayal of}} the cold and ruthless, yet fiery Regina Giddens in Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes (1939) won her the Variety magazine's award for Best Actress of the Year. Bankhead as Regina was lauded as [...] "one of the most electrifying performances in American theater history". During the run, she was featured {{on the cover of}} Life. Bankhead and playwright Hellman, both formidable women, feuded over the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. Bankhead (a staunch anti-Communist) was said <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> portion of one performance's proceeds to go to Finnish relief, while Hellman (who had defended the Moscow Trials of 1936, and {{was a member of the}} Communist Party USA in 1938–40) objected strenuously, and the two women did not speak for the next quarter of a century. Bankhead called it [...] "the best role I ever had in the theater".|$|E
