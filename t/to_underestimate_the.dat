5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> English.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} {{indicators}} is expected <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> true {{prevalence of disease}} in the population due to reduced levels of diagnosis.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{applying}} for disability benefits usually requires effort and ability to negotiate bureaucracy. It follows that less educated individuals are less likely to apply for disability benefits, possibly contributing <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> negative impact of receiving a disability benefit for disabled individuals.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{frequency}} {{content of the}} vertical ground motion, {{it can be concluded}} that structural failure modes from past earthquakes might be attributed <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> effect of vertical acceleration in the design procedures, and there is an urgent need for the adoption of more realistic vertical spectra in future version of seismic design codes.|$|R
40|$|Why, {{after so}} much promise [...] . has the harvest in the {{chemical}} area been so thin? Three basic, interrelated reasons {{give rise to}} the shortfall: 1) false expectations, which 2) in turn tended to obscure the inherent limitations in the technology, and 3) led <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of competing {{with the power of}} organic chemistry and entrenched chemical manufacturing processes...|$|R
25|$|Bella is {{described}} as being clumsy, having a weak constitution, being nonathletic and hating anything physical. Bella is also described as a reclusive loner, shy, quiet, insecure, and very sensitive. She also cares {{for the rest of}} the Cullen family, her father Charlie and mother Renée, and her friend Jacob Black. She has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> people around her mainly because of her concerns for their safety.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that BMI had a good general {{correlation}} with body fat percentage, and noted that obesity has overtaken smoking as the world's number one cause of death. But it also notes that in the study 50% of men and 62% of women were obese according to body fat defined obesity, while only 21% of men and 31% of women were obese according to BMI, meaning that BMI was found <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> number of obese subjects.|$|E
25|$|For most {{practical}} applications {{the use of}} medicines on the Sabbath, there are primarily two categories of non-life-threatening (Pikuach Nefesh) illnesses and maladies. They are either Maychush b'Alma or Choleh Kol Gufo. In many or {{most practical}} applications for non-trained personnel, there are practically only three category levels (1, 4, & 7) as the line of distinction between them can often be difficult to ascertain for the untrained and it may prove dangerous <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> condition.|$|E
5000|$|Sea ice {{extent is}} the area of sea with a {{specified}} amount of ice, usually 15%. To satellite microwave sensors, surface melt appears to be open water rather than water on top of sea ice. So, while reliable for measuring area most of the year, the microwave sensors are prone <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> actual ice concentration and area when the surface is melting.|$|R
30|$|Figure  2 shows {{a sketch}} of rock typing with fixed ranges of {{irreducible}} water saturation, where point A is classified as rock type 4 incorrectly. This will lead <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> oil in place, because through initialization stage of simulation, water saturation will be assigned based on rock type 4 (about 80 %) instead of the correct value of 30 %. The method mentioned in this paper will classify this point in rock type 1.|$|R
50|$|During construction, {{it became}} clear that the airport would become {{significantly}} more expensive due <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> actual costs in an over-optimistic calculation; construction flaws; and increased expenses for soundproofing nearby homes. The series of delays in opening is expected to lead to a number of lawsuits against FBB, which may result in large-scale damage compensation for the affected airlines and airport businesses. Air Berlin already announced its intention of such a move.|$|R
25|$|One {{of crucial}} {{failures}} of the Luftwaffe was <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> role of civil aviation on the Soviet Union. The Germans believed that it accounted for only 12 to 15 percent of all logistical traffic, {{and the nature of}} the Soviet terrain meant that rail was relied upon to deliver around 90 percent of Soviet supplies to the front, making it the prime target. The civil air organisation was deemed too primitive and ineffective. In wartime, it would contribute significantly to supporting logistics.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that recombination frequency tends <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> distance between two linked genes. This is because as the two genes are located farther apart, the chance of double or even number of crossovers between them also increases. Double or even number of crossovers between the two genes results in them being cosegregated to the same gamete, yielding a parental progeny instead of the expected recombinant progeny. As mentioned above, the Kosambi and Haldane transformations attempt to correct for multiple crossovers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to obtain reliable estimates concerning {{the number of children}} trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice. It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated. This process of gathering data is only {{complicated by the fact that}} very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking. As a result, the available statistics are widely thought <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> actual scope of the problem.|$|E
50|$|Seven learns a {{bit more}} about being human by {{experiencing}} human remorse—as she tells the Doctor—and the Doctor also agonizes over {{the result of his}} hypnosis of Seven. He asks Captain Janeway to delete the algorithms which have been driving him to expand beyond his original programming in order to improve himself. This impulse inspired him to add the subroutines to act as a psychologist. <b>The</b> Doctor admits <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> complexities of this field of profession.|$|R
30|$|Women {{perceived}} {{the risk of}} minor complications and life threatening complications to be significantly less with LH compared to AH. They appeared <b>to</b> also <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> true frequency of occurrence of complications with LH.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} approximating the nite sample null-distribution of a {{test statistic}} as its asymptotic distribution under a local alternative. We focus on the Likelihood Ratio test for the rank of cointegration and use nonlinearities that represent some nite sample distributional features. Reliable approximations are obtained using a class of locally explosive models. An empirical evaluation of the concordance of European business cycles through cointegration shows that some standard corrections lead <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> number of cointegrating relations and induce volatile results...|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, some {{indication}} {{of the level of}} search interest by adoptees can be gleaned from the case of England and Wales which opened adoptees' birth records in 1975. The UK Office for National Statistics has projected that 33% of all adoptees would eventually request a copy of their original birth records, exceeding original forecasts made in 1975 when it was believed that {{only a small fraction of}} the adoptee population would request their records. The projection is known <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> true search rate, however, since many adoptees of the era get their birth records by other means.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with BPD {{sometimes}} use {{mental health}} services extensively. People with this diagnosis accounted for about 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations in one survey. The majority of BPD patients continue to use outpatient treatment in a sustained manner for several years, but the number using the more restrictive and costly forms of treatment, such as inpatient admission, declines with time. Experience of services varies. Assessing suicide risk {{can be a challenge}} for {{mental health services}} (and patients themselves tend <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> lethality of self-injurious behaviours) with typically a chronically elevated risk of suicide much above that of the general population and a history of multiple attempts when in crisis.|$|E
25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often not be known until the child starts school. People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it is important not <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} delayed several times, at first due <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> {{developmental}} complexity and manufacturing learning {{curve of the}} production composite construction, and later due to the technical difficulties of correcting a pitch damping problem and developing the stall-warning system. By the end of development, the Starship had grown larger in cabin volume than the King Air 350 while having the same gross ramp weight of 15010 lb. Starship development cost $300 million. The first production Starship flew on April 25, 1989.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> enemy strength, <b>the</b> nationalists also <b>underestimated</b> <b>the</b> Communist capacity <b>to</b> repair damages {{inflicted by}} the opposing side. The nationalist intelligence calculated {{that after the}} air strikes that destroyed the vital Nine Dragons Bridge (Jiulong Jiang Daqiao, 九龙江大桥), it would take at least two days for the enemy to repair the bridge, but in reality, the enemy had the bridge repaired in only two hours. As the news reached the surprised nationalists, {{it was obvious that}} the mission was over and in order to avoid complete disaster, the Nationalists wisely chose to give up the fighting by withdrawing the surviving forces and abandoned the island.|$|R
50|$|Gott's 'reference class' in his {{original}} 1993 paper {{was not the}} number of births, {{but the number of}} years 'humans' had existed as a species, which he put at 200,000. Also, Gott tried to give a 95% confidence interval between a minimum survival time and a maximum. Because of the 2.5% chance that he gives <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> minimum he has only a 2.5% chance of overestimating the maximum. This equates to 97.5% confidence that extinction occurs before the upper boundary of his confidence interval.|$|R
25|$|Lower-than-expected {{levels of}} HbA1c {{can be seen}} in people with {{shortened}} red blood cell lifespan, such as with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle-cell disease, or any other condition causing premature red blood cell death. Blood donation will result in rapid replacement of lost RBCs with newly formed red blood cells. Since these new RBCs will have only existed {{for a short period of}} time, their presence will lead HbA1c <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> actual average levels. There may also be distortions resulting from blood donation which occurred as long as two months before due to an abnormal synchronization of the age of the RBCs, resulting in an older than normal average blood cell life (resulting in an overestimate of actual average blood glucose levels). Conversely, higher-than-expected levels {{can be seen in}} people with a longer red blood cell lifespan, such as with Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Hortense {{intensified}} into {{a tropical}} storm, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued by the respective governments from Martinique to the United States Virgin Islands. Late on September7, about 57hours before the hurricane's Puerto Rico landfall, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico; however, the watch was discontinued at 1500UTC on September8 after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region. At the same time, a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands 12hours earlier. At 1500UTC on September9– about fifteen hours before landfall– a hurricane warning was issued in Puerto Rico. The downgrade of the warning on the island led residents <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> hurricane's threat. Before Hortense struck Puerto Rico, the local National Weather Service office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding , with higher totals in the mountains.|$|E
25|$|It is easy today <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> {{extent to}} which the novel {{challenged}} existing social and legal structures. May Sinclair, in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. Anne's heroine eventually left her husband to protect their young son from his influence. She supported herself and her son by painting while living in hiding, fearful of discovery. In doing so, she violated not only social conventions, but English law. Until 1870, when the Married Women's Property Act was passed, a married woman had no independent legal existence apart from her husband; could not own property, sue for divorce, or control custody of her children. If she attempted to live apart, her husband had the right to reclaim her. If she took their child, she was liable for kidnapping. By living on her own income she was held to be stealing her husband's property, since any property she held or income she made was legally his.|$|E
30|$|Consequently, in {{the present}} case, {{surgical}} resection for liver tumors might be unnecessary according to the guideline [22]. Retrospectively, a preoperative histological confirmation for a hepatic lesion should have been performed. However, limited sampling size obtained with an aspiration biopsy might have also led to a misdiagnosis or <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> malignancy [23, 24]. Therefore, a possibly malignant liver lesion should be resected. A conclusive preoperative diagnostic method for malignancy of liver tumors should be established; otherwise, clinicians should carefully consider the indication for surgery against the possibility of malignancy.|$|R

50|$|The Japanese {{attempt to}} destroy the Allied landing force by counter-landing had failed, due <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> size of the Allied landing forces. Out of a force of 850 {{soldiers}} which were sent, only 475 were landed. Over 250 were killed, the rest withdrew into the jungle. Most of those {{were killed in the}} artillery barrages and the air strike between 7 and 9 November. The landing site was also an unfortunate choice: its location was very close to that of the Allied beachhead, which the Japanese believed to be further east around Cape Torokina.|$|R
25|$|Lyon {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{defeat of the}} season the following week against relegation strugglers Nantes. Lyon came into the match apparently looking ahead to their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> West Coast side, who defeated Lyon 1–2 with two goals from the Croat Ivan Klasnić. The loss was promptly followed by a showdown for first place with rivals Marseille the following week. Other than battling for first place, the return of Hatem Ben Arfa to the Stade Gerland was {{on the minds of}} supporters, as well as the players. However, despite the hype and build-up leading up to the match, including achieving a record television audience, both clubs failed to score a goal as the match ended in another 0–0 draw. Lyon finally ended their winless run with a 1–0 victory over Caen with Benzema scoring Lyon's lone goal, his tenth of the league campaign. With the victory, Lyon were assured first place heading into the three-week winter break.|$|E
500|$|The hard–easy {{effect is}} a {{cognitive}} bias that manifests itself as a tendency to overestimate the probability of one's success at a task perceived as hard, and <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of one's success at a task perceived as easy. The hard-easy effect takes place, for example, when individuals exhibit a degree of underconfidence in answering relatively easy questions and a degree of overconfidence in answering relatively difficult questions. [...] "Hard tasks tend to produce overconfidence but worse-than-average perceptions," [...] reported Katherine A. Burson, Richard P. Larrick, and Jack B. Soll in a 2005 study, [...] "whereas easy tasks tend to produce underconfidence and better-than-average effects." ...|$|E
500|$|Orton then {{produced}} {{a copy of}} SmackDown! magazine, which featured The Undertaker on the cover. Heeding Graham's advice, Orton said he would set himself apart from all other wrestlers by ending The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania. Throughout March 2005, Orton taunted The Undertaker, claiming he was unafraid of him. On the March 21 Raw, Orton turned into a villain once more after he delivered an RKO to his unsuspecting on-screen girlfriend, Stacy Keibler, knocking her unconscious. During Orton's promos, he ran for cover whenever signs of The Undertaker's appearance (lightning, darkness, or smoke) occurred. When legendary wrestler Jake Roberts advised Orton not <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker, Orton performed an RKO on Roberts as well. In {{the weeks leading up}} to WrestleMania, Orton became more defiant and unafraid of The Undertaker, taunting and assaulting him in the ring following distractions from his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton. At WrestleMania 21, however, the heavily hyped match was unsuccessful for Orton, as he lost despite his father's interference.|$|E

40|$|The {{cost of the}} {{financial}} crisis to the real economy has so far remained underexamined,probably because of the difficulty in making such an assessment. The crisis was precipitatedby an unsustainable bubble that artificially inflated economic fi ures, so what should be used as a benchmark for measuring the effects of the crisis on the real economy? How reliable are current estimates of the output gap? Could overestimating this indicator lead <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> <b>the</b> current risk of inflation?
