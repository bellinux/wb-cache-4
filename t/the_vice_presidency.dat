5|$|Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913– December 26, 2006) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 38th President of the United States from August 1974 to January 1977, following the resignation of Richard Nixon. Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew. He was the first person appointed to <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> {{under the terms of the}} 25th Amendment, and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office. Before his appointment to <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency,</b> Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader.|$|E

Moore praised his devotion to freedom of religion and his opposition to imprisonment for debt.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|Initially a Republican, {{he became}} an early member of the Prohibition Party.

5|$|Murray M Chotiner (October 4, 1909– January 30, 1974) was an American {{political}} strategist, attorney, government official, {{and close}} associate {{and friend of}} President Richard Nixon {{during much of the}} 37th President's political career. He served as campaign manager for the future president's successful runs for the United States Senate in 1950 and for <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1952, and managed the campaigns of other California Republicans. He was active in each of Nixon's two successful runs for the White House in low-profile positions.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor {{had been}} George H.

Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him.|$|E
5|$|The PJ held primary {{elections}} for the 1989 presidential elections between Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, and Antonio Cafiero, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Menem won these elections, with Duhalde as candidate for <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> under his ticket, and then won the general elections. Duhalde {{did not like the}} legislative work, and preferred to work with the actual administration of a district. Menem suggested that he run for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province, which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province. This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín, which led to a steady alliance between both politicians. Duhalde was elected governor, ending the political influence of Cafiero.|$|E

5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} native-born citizen of the United States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and {{did not come to}} the United States until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 2009.

He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5|$|By {{her second}} {{year on the}} seven member board, she was a {{unanimous}} selection to be second in command as Columbus School Board Vice President. She was unanimously re-elected the following year. In her fourth year of service on the board beginning on January 3, 1995, she lost a 4–3 election for Columbus School Board President when the incumbent, Robert W.

She subsequently declined <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> During her fourth year, she unsuccessfully attempted to include a sexual orientation policy in the school district's nondiscrimination policy that would protect homosexuals. She was reelected in 1995. In 1996, she contested Ohio's 16th district seat in the Ohio State Senate with Eugene Watts, but she lost by a 51.80–37.46% margin in a five-way contest.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> {{president of a}} club or organization is {{to be prepared to}} assume the powers and duties of the office of the president {{in the case of a}} vacancy in that office.

50|$|Summerville {{was elected}} <b>vice</b> {{president}} in <b>the</b> 1901 elections under President Garretson W. Gibson, and was reelected in 1903 and 1905 under President Arthur Barclay. However, Summerville died on July 27, 1905 prior to taking office {{for his third}} term. As no constitutional provision allowed for the replacement of a vice president, meaning that President Barclay would {{have been forced to}} serve his entire term without a <b>vice</b> president, <b>the</b> constitution was amended in 1905 to allow for a special election to be held in the event of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency's</b> vacancy.|$|R
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency,</b> with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the delegates}} turned to <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> Edmund Pettus, {{representing}} Alabama, moved {{the nomination of}} William Hayden English, a banker and former representative from Indiana. English, {{a member of the}} Indiana delegation, was fairly unknown to most delegates. He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and hard money supporter; more crucially, he hailed from an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. John P. Irish of Iowa nominated former governor Richard M. Bishop of Ohio but, after all the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election.

He served as one of the president's advisers and a liaison between the White House and Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt's patronage system. Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

5|$|With Speaker Schuyler Colfax’ {{election}} to <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 1868, {{the leadership of}} the House became vacant.

He was elected with the unanimous vote of the Republican members {{at the start of the}} 41st Congress in March 1869. Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House.
