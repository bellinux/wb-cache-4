500|$|In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and {{selectors}} wagered {{the potential}} returns in finishing games with two openside flankers {{on the field}} {{as a way to}} counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> there. The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when you pull the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do stop, you naughty, fretty baby. I'm {{tired of}} your screaming, and it's high <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to sleep. Bless me! what's Miss Shadow doing with her baby?" [...] said Polly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You might {{mention that}} the next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to her house," [...] said Captain Asher. [...] "I don't believe {{it has ever been}} {{properly}} considered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' said Wali Dad, 'next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> that way, {{give her}} this little bracelet, with the respectful {{compliments}} {{of one who}} admires virtue far more than he desires wealth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you'd better {{break your}} rules next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{out in the}} woods where Harry is," [...] said the turkey-hunter, [...] "or he'll pop you over for a turkey or a musk-rat. He's a sharp shot, I kin tell ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hey, you Sitting Bull," [...] says I, [...] "don't scrouge so. Anyhow, don't {{you think}} it's about <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> in on a customs payment and got reissued? For {{a series of}} 1899 you're a sight." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes!--with a {{mother-in-law}} who is {{a perfect}} Turk and Tartar, for all I hear--with Indian war-whoops howling all around you and with a danger of losing your scalp, or of being eat up by a wild beast every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out for yourself, that's all I'm sayin'," [...] Master Jellison replied angrily. [...] "I'm watchin' you, an' {{the very}} first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to meddlin' with that feller from the country, what's got to be drove out this city, I'll make you sorry for it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said I--I expect with {{flashing}} eye--"but {{the next}} <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> into the disciple business I {{recommend that you}} take boys who {{really need to know}} something about farming, and not fine-as-fiddle young women that you might as well be ballet-dancing with as raking with, for all the hankering after knowledge they have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> down, give {{a fellow}} warning," [...] {{retorted}} his brother, scrambling to his feet; {{and then the}} two boys, with Jack and Fred, entered the sitting-room, doing this just as their fathers {{came in from the}} direction of the kitchen and just when old Uncle Randolph made his unfortunate attack on the fish-globe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> home," [...] the {{official}} finally said, in an angry tone. [...] "You {{know so much}} about this thing that I don't believe it's safe to have you where there are many valuable things which might be stolen." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hardly, Dick, {{considering}} that last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> out <b>you</b> tumbled off three times at some jumps two feet wide, and that, were you {{to fall in}} front of a pig, he would rip you up before <b>you</b> had <b>time</b> to think about it; besides which, you would almost certainly stick somebody with your spear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{you don't}} {{mean to tell}} me that you're taking a {{shipboard}} flirtation seriously. Why, you're expected {{to fall in love with}} a different girl every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on a voyage. You'll get over this in a week. You'd have got over it now if you hadn't gone and buried yourself in a depressing place like Bingley-on-the-Sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> courting a {{young lady}} in secret," [...] said Silas, [...] "make sure that the moon goes down first, or wait for a cloudy sky. You were seen in the garden, Master Jago; and {{you may as well}} tell us the truth for once in a way. Did you find her open to persuasion, sir? Did she say 'Yes?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} time came when they must really part, or she would be late for lunch, and mamma would know all; mamma would read everything. He looked her wistfully in the face.

5000|$|They ordered {{us where}} to {{position}} ourselves, {{how we should}} sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang {{you knew it was}} Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who had to get on the phone, if you were standing, if <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> to the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the <b>times</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's high <b>time</b> <b>you</b> did <b>go</b> to church," [...] remarked Eleanor, contemplating, {{not without}} pride, her husband's close-cropped, pugnacious head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Possibly," [...] I said, [...] "for a man {{who rode}} in nothing but his bones. I only know that I tried it myself, and that to {{a man who}} wore flesh it was agony. Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> over a stone or a rut it nipped you; it was like riding on an {{irritable}} lobster. You rode that for a month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But then, {{with your}} {{well-known}} fidelity, considering that you're staying here {{at least a}} fortnight, you won't have any illusions left about me by the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> I give you a week, Cassandra. I shall see my power fading day by day. Now it's at the climax; but to-morrow it'll have begun to fade. What am I to wear, I wonder?

6000|$|By the way, {{talking of}} light suits, {{have you ever}} noticed how people stare at you the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out {{in a new light}} suit They do not notice it so much afterward. The {{population}} of London have got accustomed to it by the third time you wear it. I say [...] "you," [...] because I am not speaking from my own experience. I do not wear such things at all myself. As I said, only sinful people do so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then why don't {{you let me}} {{have some}} money of my own?' {{retorted}} Joe, sorrowfully; 'why don't you, father? What do you send me into London for, giving me only the right to call for my dinner at the Black Lion, which you're to pay for next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> as if I {{was not to be}} trusted with a few shillings? Why do you use me like this? It's not right of you. You can't expect me to be quiet under it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Those {{understanding}} eyes of Lucilla's {{were drinking}} in each word, but Uncle Kit ruthlessly said--'There, it's your walking <b>time,</b> children; <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out now.' ...|$|R
5000|$|You don't {{have to go}} to court, {{no matter}} how bad your problem is. The only <b>times</b> <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> to court are when: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why not? It's due you to {{know how}} splendid Glenn was.... I tell you, Carley, all the boys here love you for the way you've stuck to Glenn. Some of them knew him, and I've told the rest. We thought he'd never pull through. But he has, and we know how you helped. Going West to see him! He didn't write it to me, but I know.... I'm wise. I'm happy for him--the lucky dog. Next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> West--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] said another, [...] "Diggs' tommy is only open once a-week, and if you're {{not there}} in <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> over for another seven days.

6000|$|... 'But it's so {{much harder}} {{to do it to}} your face, Mr. Walters,' Selah said, again blushing. 'Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away I say to myself, [...] "I shall call him Herbert as soon as ever he comes back again;" [...] and every time you come back, I feel too much afraid of you, the moment I see you, ever to do it. And yet of course I ought to, you know, for when we're married, why, naturally, then I shall have to learn to call you Herbert, shan't I?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are they now? Well {{perhaps they}} are. And {{how do you}} think our Miss Madeline is looking? She wasn't just well for one short <b>time</b> after <b>you</b> <b>went</b> away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Stephen," [...] she pleaded, [...] "I am sorry--to {{be such a}} fool--but {{this thing}} has lived with me a long <b>time,</b> and--would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away? It would be kindest." ...|$|R
