40|$|The aim of {{this inquiry}} is to {{investigate}} which ideals of democracy that three <b>proposals</b> for strengtening <b>the</b> democracy in the European Union consists of and to judge if the desired effects of <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> are reachable. <b>The</b> method that is used is an analysis of ideas and contents.

The theories are used to investigate if the ideas in <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> correspond to <b>the</b> ideals of deliberative and participatory democracy. The major result is that <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> fail to fulfil {{the ideas of the}} theories. The reason is that <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> are lacking ideas of how to make the citizens more aware and active in politics. The point of departure in <b>the</b> <b>proposals</b> is that <b>the</b> European Union will be more democratic if the people are brought in to the politics, but they do not suggest how people should form opinions through communication and become conscious and competent in political issues through participation.

5|$|Filming for <b>The</b> <b>Proposal</b> {{initiated}} in April 2008 in Rockport, Massachusetts. In the oncoming days leading to production, {{areas of the}} town were temporarily remodeled to represent Sitka, Alaska, the setting {{of most of the}} film. Principal photography officially began on April 9 at Bearskin Neck, where it continued over a period of 24 hours. Filming continued at the Motif Number One building on Bradley Wharf (April 14–16), the Haskins Building (April 15–18), and the central business district of Rockport (April 17). Principal photography relocated to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts on April 22, where it resumed over an approximate period of two weeks. In response, city officials accommodated the producers by renting out all publicly owned parking lots. Filming for <b>The</b> <b>Proposal</b> was shortly delayed after Bullock and her husband were involved in a car accident. The wedding scene was filmed in a three-story twentieth century Victorian home; photography took place at the residence for three weeks. In an interview with the New York Times, the owners of the home stated that Nelson Coates knocked on their door asking for leaves. Initially, the owners directed Coates to other residences in the area; however, they eventually gave the film's producer a tour of the house. Production occurred {{on the first floor of}} the home. Outside of the Cape Ann area, filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts at the State Street Bank Building and in Lower Manhattan in New York City. <b>The</b> <b>Proposal</b> contained 350 special effect shots, and some parts were edited using computer-generated imagery.
