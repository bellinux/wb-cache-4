40|$|Tourism {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{economical}} drivers for small island developing states. An adhoc approach towards tourist accommodation developments may have major, economic, social and environmental impacts. If in the future Curaçao only maximizes economic benefits and ignores environmental issues, it may experience the pitfall of unsustainable mass <b>tourism.</b> <b>Tourism</b> <b>developments</b> have been identified as a tool for local economic development and could also contribute towards social development of communities, and conservation of the natural environment. If managed and developed in a sustainable way. In order to determine what the effects of physical <b>tourism</b> <b>developments</b> are on the economy, society and the environment, a set of sustainability indicators (SIs) has been selected and assessed which has lead towards guidelines and a sustainable vision for plantage Santa Catharina located in Curacao. The objectives of the study were to determine the elements of sustainable <b>tourism</b> <b>developments</b> from existing literature; to identify a framework for selecting both generic and site-specific SIs; to select appropriate indicators for <b>tourism</b> <b>developments</b> in Curacao context; and to do a baseline assessment of three tourist development sites to determine the suitability of the selected methods and indicators. Data were collected by making use of structured interviews and collected data from Curacao tourism bureau which served as primary source of material in the attempt to develop sustainability assessment maps (SAMs). The research draws on the work of Ko (2005) in which he developed a conceptual approach for conducting a sustainable assessment. His work is used as a basis for the research, because of the scope of this study only three dimensions has been analysed. The results of the study show that the identified indicators provide a means of determining overall sustainability of physical <b>tourism</b> <b>developments.</b> Visualizing research findings is a good way of presenting data to interested parties that are involved in planning, monitoring aspect of <b>tourism</b> <b>developments.</b> Throughout the process of the research and study for this paper, it has become obvious that there are a huge number of directions for future research in relation to this similar area. In order to conduct a further and deeper research study, some indications are provided as these are: -Further analysis of Ko (2005) Sustainable assessment the other nine dimensions. Example this research was based only on three dimensions. -Further analysis of Sustainable assessment on <b>tourism</b> <b>developments.</b> Example this research was based on SIDS, it is better to sample from a worldwide level. -Further analysis of the development of good practice in sustainable tourism through developing a transparent measurement, monitoring and reporting system. - Further analysis of eco certificate for <b>tourism</b> <b>developments,</b> awarded good practice examples, e. g. Fiskars Village (Finland), the winner from the Royal Awards for sustainable tourism. The above recommendations are made for improving the overall sustainability of <b>tourism</b> <b>developments.</b> Finally there needs to be a more manageable overview of indicators.

5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's <b>tourism</b> <b>development</b> strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E

By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society.

5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for <b>Tourism</b> <b>Development</b> in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E

In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy.

During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October–November), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair. The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels.
