40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential utilization of ostrich meat trimming in hamburger preparation, as well as its physicochemical and sensory characterization. Using ostrich meat trimmings from the legs and neck, four different formulations were prepared with varied amounts of bacon and <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein.</b> Physical analysis of yield, shrinkage percentage, and water retention capacity and chemical analysis of proximate composition, cholesterol levels, and calories were performed.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} cashew fiber in combination with <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein</b> for the preparation of vegetable burger. Two treatments were studied to reduce fiber size (mechanical pressing with or without enzymatic maceration) {{and its impact on}} physical chemical characteristics, sensory acceptance and stability of burgers stored at - 18 °C for 180 days. Both burger formulations had high moisture and carbohydrate contents and low lipid contents. Enzymatic fiber maceration resulted in harder products with lower moisture content. During storage, reduction in pH and ascorbic acid and increase in acidity values were observed, with no tendencies for color values. Throughout the storage period, burgers were within microbiological standards of the Brazilian legislation for human consumption and average sensory acceptance was within acceptance zone. It was concluded that the inclusion of enzymatic maceration in the fiber treatment process has no advantages and that burgers elaborated with cashew fiber and <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein</b> can be consumed up to six months of frozen storage...|$|R
