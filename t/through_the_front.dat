5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is able to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door and return to Earth, {{the presence of a}} Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|Big Run, a {{tributary}} stream of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage. Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{lawn of the}} house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own car and drove it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 340 south of Front Royal in Warren County, heading east into dense forests in Shenandoah National Park as a two-lane undivided road. The road curves south and passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> Royal Entrance Station, where a ranger station is located. At this point, the drive winds south and ascends the Blue Ridge Mountains. The roadway heads southwest {{and comes to}} the Shenandoah Valley Overlook {{on the west side}} of the road.|$|E
5|$|Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), {{under the}} command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, set their sights on the {{occupation}} of the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. General George S. Patton's Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine, while General Courtney Hodges's First Army was ordered to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> near Aachen. Hodges had initially hoped to bypass the city itself, believing it to be held only by a small garrison, which would presumably surrender once isolated.|$|E
60|$|They now {{looked more}} {{carefully}} at the sand-boat, {{and saw that the}} bottom was modelled with two sharp runners which would glide <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sand. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> sand-boat was pointed like the bow of a ship, and there was a rudder at the stern to steer by.|$|R

5|$|The property's {{original}} {{area was}} 2acres (8,000 m²), {{but this was}} reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, {{between the house and}} river. On May 31, 1860, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad opened with a train from Danville. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran behind the house. The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's course <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> yard; the track behind the house no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{returned to}} the front on 7 June, relieving the 8th Light Horse Regiment on Walkers Ridge. The 2nd and 9th Squadrons manned the front trench, with the 6th Squadron in reserve. Trench warfare, shelling and sniping continued all month {{but there was no}} major attack. The regiment spent their time rotating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and resting at the rear. On 1 July reinforcements of four officers and ninety-seven other ranks arrived. On 18 July the regiment {{returned to the}} front, relieving the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, each squadron with two troops forward and the other two in reserve. They remained there until 31 July when they were relieved by the 10th Light Horse Regiment. Returning to the rear, the regiment only had twenty-four officers and 338 other ranks, almost 200 men short of full establishment.|$|E
5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, {{with one of the}} divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{different}} ways to insert the needle into the stitch. Knitting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of a stitch is called Western knitting.

A third method, called combination knitting, goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of a knit stitch and the back of a purl stitch.|$|E
25|$|To further {{solve the}} problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the {{corporation}} was stipulating two door bus bodies with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and alighting - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> (28').|$|E
