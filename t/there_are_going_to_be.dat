500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Red Dress" [...] {{was directed by}} Tim Royes and filmed in January 2006. Berrabah revealed details about the music video during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "We're shooting the vid this week with director Tim Royce. We're {{really looking forward to}} it as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lots of costume changes. It's going to have a catwalk show theme with lots of mad outfits – very [...] over the top and extravagant – we can't wait!" [...] Royes went on to direct the music video for Sugababes' single [...] "Easy" [...] in the same year. The Sugababes wore endorsed hosiery in scenes for the video as part of their endorsement with Pretty Polly.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|About.com writer Ryan Cooper {{praised the}} album, awarded it four stars {{out of five}} and said it [...] "laughs {{in the face of}} those who think passionate realism, artistic {{integrity}} and mass commercial appeal are all mutually exclusive. Daybreaker balances all three with pretty much perfect dexterity." [...] Raziq Rauf writing for the BBC praised the band for the album's musical diversity with its use of electronic songs like album-opener [...] "The Bitter End" [...] and the band's use of technicality and melody in songs. He summarised the album by saying, [...] "Daybreaker is a great album. It’ll go down as one of Architects’ finest worksit’s certainly their most well-rounded release to date." [...] Big Cheese writer Paul Hagen praised the album's lyrical content, saying, [...] "Socially turbulent times seems to produce the best music and if bands can keep channelling genuine anger into their art, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some more really great albums released over the next few years".|$|E

500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
2500|$|The {{settlement}} was mediated by retired judge Sir Henry Brooke. Before settlement had been reached, Chris Mallender explained: [...] "We {{have reached a}} view that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no outright winners in this. In the circumstances we feel that it's better that we try and find a middle ground, we settle in a way that's fair to the families, but is also fair {{in terms of the}} residual burden on the council tax payer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 12, 2015, Verizon {{announced}} plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. Armstrong, who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. [...] "If you look forward five years, you're {{going to be in}} a space where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon." [...] he said. [...] "It's really not about selling the company today. It's about setting up for the next five to 10 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} a March 2005 GLAAD Media Award for its coverage of LGBT issues, One Life to Live was met with criticism when married district attorney Daniel Colson (Mark Dobies) was revealed to have murdered two people {{to cover up the}} fact that he was secretly gay. GLAAD itself criticized the storyline [...] "for reinforcing the idea that being gay is something to be ashamed of," [...] while TV Guide noted [...] "It's hard to disagree with those who say that's a lousy representation of gay folks." [...] Executive Producer Frank Valentini defended the story, saying, [...] "This is a story about the harsher side of intolerance and about one man not being true to himself. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> meaningful, frank discussions that come out of this." [...] Then-head writer Dena Higley explained, [...] "The number one rule of soap opera is never cut drama. Daniel being gay and keeping that a secret is a dramatic story." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2007, Libby {{was sentenced}} to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of {{probation}} (supervised release) after the expiration of his prison term. According to The Washington Post, Judge Walton expressed his belief that the trial did not prove Libby knew that Plame worked in an undercover capacity when he disclosed her identity to several reporters. He added, however, that [...] "anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency ... make every conceivable effort" [...] to verify their status before releasing information about them. Walton stated [...] "While {{there is no evidence}} that Mr. Libby knew what the situation was, he surely did not take any efforts to find out,...I think public officials need to know if they are going to step over the line, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consequences.... causes people to think our government does not work for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healey was {{appointed}} Shadow Chancellor in April 1972 after Roy Jenkins resigned {{in a row}} over the European Economic Community (Common Market). At the Labour Party conference on 1 October 1973, he said, [...] "I warn you that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> howls of anguish from those rich enough to pay over 75% on their last slice of earnings". In a speech in Lincoln on 18 February 1974, Healey went further, promising he would [...] "squeeze property speculators until the pips squeak." [...] He alleged that Lord Carrington, the Conservative Secretary of State for Energy, had made £10m profit from selling agricultural land at prices 30 to 60 times {{as high as it}} would command as farming land. When accused by colleagues including Eric Heffer of putting Labour's chances of winning the next election in jeopardy through his tax proposals, Healey said the party and the country must face the consequences of Labour's policy of the redistribution of income and wealth; [...] "That is what our policy is, the party must face the realities of it".|$|E

2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{is known}} for his physical, north-south style of game. Brown {{considers}} himself a clean hitter: after a controversial hit on Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Michal Rozsíval in the 2012 Western Conference Finals, Brown defended himself by saying, [...] "I take pride in playing the game clean and hard. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hits that are unfortunate but still clean." [...] Brown had never been issued a fine or suspension from the NHL Department of Player Safety until April 24, 2013, when he received two-game suspension for an illegal elbow to the head of Minnesota Wild forward Jason Pominville on April 23, 2013. Rob Blake said Brown [...] "comes at guys straight on, face-to-face. He goes right through guys." [...] Despite his aggressive style, Brown has not missed a game due to injury in four seasons. Brown {{is one of the most}} effective NHL players at drawing penalties, having led the League in that category in five of seven post-lockout seasons. Brown's unparalleled success in that area has led several commentators, including ex-NHL referee Kerry Fraser, to say that Brown has acquired a reputation for embellishing infractions in order to draw penalties. Beyond his physicality and agitation, Brown has provided a consistent offensive threat for the Kings, scoring at least 22 goals five consecutive years. Brown plays an effective two-way game and has matured into an elite defensive and penalty-killing forward.|$|E
2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E

2500|$|The {{season was}} first {{announced}} on February 1, 2007. That same day, {{it was confirmed that}} Arnold Shapiro had {{stepped down as}} producer, opting instead to appear as the executive consultant. On the decision, Shaprio stated he was [...] "gratified that (he and Allison) were able to successfully ‘re-invent’ BB2 and turn the series into an annual summer hit." [...] Grodner later stated [...] "We consider ‘All-Stars’ sort of the end of an era, and now we’re getting a chance to start once again with a fresh cast and new twists." [...] Rich Meehan replaced Shapiro as the executive producer. Casting for the season concluded on May 5, 2007. Grodner later promised fans of the series that Big Brother 8 would be more interactive, commenting [...] "It's not just about sitting down and watching television [...] We're a summer event that's always with you. I don't think any other show has that sort of reach." [...] Ghen Maynard of CBS later stated [...] "This year, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some new things that make the show even more ubiquitous and interactive [...] there will be something die-hard fans will love. It will give them the opportunity to participate even more than they have in the past." [...] Shortly before the premiere, a cast list began circulating the internet; casting director Robyn Kass, however, denied that this was the real cast. The cast was revealed on June 28, 2007.|$|E
