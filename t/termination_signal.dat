5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia.

40|$|Translation {{termination}} in eukaryotes {{is mediated}} by two release factors, eRF 1 and eRF 3. eRF 1 recognizes {{each of the}} three stop codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA) and facilitates release of the nascent polypeptide chain. eRF 3 is a GTPase that stimulates the translation termination process by a poorly characterized mechanism. In this study, we examined the functional importance of GTP hydrolysis by eRF 3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that mutations that reduced the rate of GTP hydrolysis also reduced the efficiency of translation termination at some <b>termination</b> <b>signals</b> but not others. As much as a 17 -fold decrease in the termination efficiency was observed at some tetranucleotide <b>termination</b> <b>signals</b> (characterized by the stop codon and the first following nucleotide), while no effect was observed at other <b>termination</b> <b>signals.</b> To determine whether this stop signal-dependent decrease in the efficiency of translation termination was due to a defect in either eRF 1 or eRF 3 recycling, we reduced the level of eRF 1 or eRF 3 in cells by expressing them individually from the CUP 1 promoter. We found that the limitation of either factor resulted in a general decrease in the efficiency of translation termination rather than a decrease at a subset of <b>termination</b> <b>signals</b> as observed with the eRF 3 GTPase mutants. We also found that overproduction of eRF 1 was unable to increase the efficiency of translation termination at any <b>termination</b> <b>signals.</b> Together, these results suggest that the GTPase activity of eRF 3 is required to couple the recognition of translation <b>termination</b> <b>signals</b> by eRF 1 to efficient polypeptide chain release...|$|R

50|$|Disequilibrium {{syndrome}} (DES) {{was first}} {{described in the}} 1970s as a non-progressive, neurological disorder. In a 2005 study, DES was renamed as VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia (VLDLRCH) after its cause was linked to a disruption in the VLDLR gene. At least six mutations affecting the homozygous recessive allele of the VLDLR gene have been identified and found to cause VLDLRCH. Several of these mutations have been localized to specific exons encoding the gene. One such mutation is a cytosine to thymine transition at base pair 1342 in exon 10 that causes a substitution at Arg448 for a <b>termination</b> <b>signal.</b> Likewise, {{there is evidence of}} a cytosine to thymine transition at base pair number 769 in exon 5 that causes a substitution at Arg257 for a <b>termination</b> <b>signal.</b> A third known mutation is caused by a homozygous 1-base pair deletion in exon 17 that causes a frameshift and premature termination in the O-linked sugar domain. All such alterations to the VLDLR gene prevent the production of VLDLR and are therefore termed loss-of-function mutations. The recognized symptoms of VLDLRCH are moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, seizures, dysarthria, strabismus and delayed locomotion. In some cases, children with VLDLRCH learn to walk very late in development after the age of six years, or never learn to walk independently. The frequency of this disorder is unknown because early diagnosis of VLDLRCH is difficult using imaging techniques. It is associated with parental consanguinity and found in secluded communities such as the Hutterites and inbred families from Iran and Turkey.|$|E

This structure forms when the cell has an excess of tryptophan and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded.

This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{model for}} the {{mechanism}} of intrinsic transcription termination involves dissociation of the RNA from forward-translocated (hypertranslocated) states of the complex [Yarnell WS, Roberts JW (1999) Science, 284 : 611 - 615]. The current study demonstrates that halted elongation complexes of T 7 RNA polymerase {{in the absence of}} <b>termination</b> <b>signals</b> can also dissociate via a forward-translocation mechanism. Shortening of the downstream DNA or the introduction of a stretch of mismatched DNA immediately downstream of the halt site reduces a barrier to forward translocation and correspondingly reduces the lifetime of halted complexes. Conversely, introduction of a cross-link downstream of the halt site increases the same barrier and leads to an increase in complex lifetime. Introduction of a mismatch within the bubble reduces a driving force for forward translocation and correspondingly increases the lifetime of the complex, but only for mismatches at the upstream edge of the bubble, as predicted by the model. Mismatching only the two most upstream of the eight bases in the bubble provides a maximal increase in complex stability, suggesting that dissociation occurs primarily from early forward-translocated states. Finally, addition in trans of an oligonucleotide complementary to the nascent RNA just beyond the hybrid complements the loss of driving force derived from placement of a mismatch within the bubble, confirming the expected additivity of effects. Thus, forward translocation is likely a general mechanism for dissociation of elongation complexes, both in the presence and absence of intrinsic <b>termination</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
