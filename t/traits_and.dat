40|$|Four {{types of}} {{matrices}} of expectations which serve as targets in Procrustes rotation are presented and investigated. These types were matrices with trait expectations, matrices with <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> method expectations, matrices with <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> method expecta-tions which {{are independent of}} each other <b>and</b> matrices with <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> method expec-tations which are adjusted and independent of each other. All the matrices with <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> method expectations are expected to separate trait influences from method influ-ences. Procrustes rotation with these matrices as target was applied to multitrait-multimethod matrices. The results demonstrate that trait expectations are not always sufficient for the identification of trait influences. The additional consideration of method expectations improved the results. The matrix with <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> method expecta-tions as target led to the best results...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} sensitivity, specificity, {{and positive}} and negative predictive value of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) for screening alpha-thalassemia- 1 <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> beta-thalassemia <b>trait</b> Material <b>and</b> Method: Descriptive analysis, diagnostic test, was conducted on 396 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic between September 2007 and June 2008. Blood samples were collected from pregnant women after counseling and getting informed consent. MCH was measured in all samples by automated hematology analyzer. Determination of HbA 2 level for diagnosis of beta-thalassmia <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> PCR for alpha-thalassemia- 1 gene (SEA type) were performed in all cases as a gold standard. The data were collected and analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, and {{positive and negative}} predictive value of MCH for screening alpha-thalassemia- 1 <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> beta-thalassemia <b>trait.</b> Results: Based on the ROC curve, the best cut-off level of MCH in predicting the thalassemia carriers was 26. 5 picrograms. Positive MCH (< 26. 5 picrograms) gave the sensitivity of 95. 2 % and specificity of 82. 3 % in screening alpha-thalassemia- 1 <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> beta-thalassemia <b>trait.</b> The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 40. 4 % and 99. 3 % respectively.

The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic <b>traits</b> <b>and</b> mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini.

The diagnostic accuracy for the H-M index was 19. 4 % for alpha-thalassaemia trait, 72. 1 % for beta-thalassaemia <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> 91. 1 % for iron deficiency. By comparison, the DF gave a diagnostic accuracy of 75. 0 % for alpha-thalassaemia trait, 81. 4 % for beta-thalassaemia <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> 88. 9 % for iron deficiency when using a locally derived value for the constant (k) = 19. 2.

5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable <b>traits,</b> <b>and</b> ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel <b>traits</b> <b>and</b> speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

The present research {{was designed to}} study them together. We tested the relation between <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> perceived environmental competitiveness, and tested these variables as separate and sequential predictors of both performance-based goals and performance attainment. Methods: In Studies 1 a (n= 387) and 1 b (n= 322), we assessed participants’ <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> perceived environmental competitiveness, as well as third variable candidates. In Study 2 (n= 434), we sought to replicate and extend Study 1 by adding reports of performance-based goal pursuit. In Study 3 (n= 403), we sought to replicate and extend Study 2 by adding real-world performance attainment. The studies focused on both the classroom and the workplace. Results: <b>Trait</b> <b>and</b> perceived environmental competitiveness were shown to be positively related, and were shown to positively predict separate variance in performance-approach and performance-avoidance goal pursuit. Perceived environmental competitiveness and performance-based goal pursuit were shown to be sequential mediators of the indirect relation between <b>trait</b> competitiveness <b>and</b> performance attainment. Conclusions: These studies highlight the importance of attending to the interplay of the person and the (perceived) situation in analyses of competitive striving...|$|R

A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological <b>traits</b> <b>and</b> mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with congenital heart disease (ConHD) report a diminished health-related quality of life. PURPOSE: This study examines the mechanisms by which ConHD affects health-related quality of life. We hypothesize that (1) the relation between <b>trait</b> anxiety <b>and</b> quality of life is mediated by a negative interpretation bias for heart sensations, specifically in ConHD, and that (2) the relation between <b>trait</b> anxiety <b>and</b> interpretation bias is mediated by state anxiety. METHOD: Sixty-six patients with ConHD and 50 healthy participants read a vignette about a person experiencing ambiguous heart-related sensations. Interpretation bias to these sensations was assessed with the Implicit Models of Illness Questionnaire. Participants completed Spielberger <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> state anxiety questionnaires and the physical subscales of a quality-of-life questionnaire. RESULTS: Path-analysis demonstrated that interpretation bias mediated the relation between <b>trait</b> anxiety <b>and</b> daily functioning. However, <b>trait</b> anxiety <b>and</b> interpretation bias were less influential with respect to gross motor functioning. Moreover, state anxiety mediated the relation between <b>trait</b> anxiety <b>and</b> interpretation bias. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that patients with ConHD who display both elevated levels of <b>trait</b> <b>and</b> state anxiety exhibit the most pronounced negative interpretation bias for heart sensations and in turn diminished daily functionin...|$|R

For example, individual trends in uncertainty (stressor) and worrying (strain) were related, whereas worrying also showed a short-term relationship with time pressure (another stressor).
