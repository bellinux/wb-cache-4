5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of <b>threads,</b> namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured <b>threads.</b> The wrapping <b>threads</b> give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft <b>threads.</b> Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft <b>threads,</b> which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp <b>threads,</b> leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but uneven sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} <b>threads</b> above. Insects {{that hit the}} stopping <b>threads</b> fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto it by the spider, and are held by sticky <b>threads</b> on the sheet until the spider can attack from below.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder <b>threads</b> {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck <b>threads</b> can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
50|$|A Unified <b>Thread</b> Standard UNC <b>thread</b> is {{mechanically}} interchangeable with a USS <b>thread</b> of {{the same}} diameter. However, there are tolerance and other differences between a <b>thread</b> compliant with the USS <b>thread</b> and a Unified <b>Thread</b> Standard UNC <b>thread.</b> The Unified <b>Thread</b> Standard for quarter inch and larger <b>threaded</b> fasteners was adopted on November 18, 1948, and was subsequently adopted for smaller <b>thread</b> series.|$|R
50|$|United States Standard <b>thread</b> (USS <b>thread),</b> {{also known}} as Sellers Standard <b>thread,</b> Franklin Institute <b>thread</b> and American Standard <b>thread,</b> is a {{standard}} for inch based <b>threaded</b> fasteners and washers.|$|R
25|$|Machine {{embroidery}} commonly uses polyester, rayon, or metallic embroidery <b>thread,</b> though other <b>thread</b> {{types are}} available. 40 wt <b>thread</b> {{is the most}} commonly used embroidery <b>thread</b> weight. Bobbin <b>thread</b> is usually either 60 wt or 90 wt. The quality of <b>thread</b> used can greatly affect the number of <b>thread</b> breaks and other embroidery problems. Polyester <b>thread</b> is generally more color-safe and durable. High quality embroidery <b>thread</b> is produced by Exquisite, Gunold, Madeira, Amann and Robison-Anton.|$|R
5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} <b>threads,</b> those <b>threads</b> spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more <b>threads)</b> increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft <b>threads</b> back over the warp <b>threads</b> when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal <b>threads,</b> curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa a {{hydrostatic}} test is required every 4 years, and visual inspection every year. Eddy current testing of neck <b>threads</b> {{must be done}} according to the manufacturer's recommendations.|$|E
50|$|A client <b>thread</b> {{sending a}} message is BLOCKED (the process <b>thread</b> {{execution}} is temporarily suspended) until the server <b>thread</b> sends a received message acknowledgement, processes the message, and executes a reply. When the server <b>thread</b> replies the client <b>thread</b> becomes READY (unblocked). The server <b>thread</b> typically loops, waiting to receive a message from a client <b>thread.</b>|$|R
30|$|Prediction of sewing <b>thread</b> {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the significant factors in <b>thread</b> procurement. In apparel industry both garment manufacturers and <b>thread</b> suppliers predict <b>thread</b> consumption per unit length of stitch for their <b>thread</b> purchasing and logistics processes. Inaccurate <b>thread</b> consumption predictions lead to inaccurate costing and reduction of warehouse utilization for both garment manufacturers and sewing <b>thread</b> manufacturers. Purchase of excess or shortage quantities of <b>thread</b> cones make suppliers to endure those excess or shortage <b>thread</b> quantities, so that both parties undergo inflexible logistic process (Jaouadi et al. 2006). In this context sewing <b>thread</b> manufacturers and garment manufacturers are looking for accurate method predicting sewing <b>thread</b> consumption for given stitch lengths so that wastages could be minimized.|$|R
25|$|<b>Thread</b> cutting, as {{compared}} to <b>thread</b> forming and rolling, is used when full <b>thread</b> depth is required, when the quantity is small, when the blank is not very accurate, when <b>threading</b> up to a shoulder is required, when <b>threading</b> a tapered <b>thread,</b> or when the material is brittle.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} run safely on {{multiprocessor}} machines, access to shared resources (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that <b>threads</b> or processes do {{not attempt to}} modify the same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple <b>threads</b> from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, DragonFly employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. While both Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, DragonFly does not. Until recently, DragonFly also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneous {{multithreading}} (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is {{the best}} known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle from multiple <b>threads.</b> Temporal multithreading {{on the other hand}} includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple <b>threads.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spherical spores measure 3–5μm, {{including}} an outer covering (an epispore) of about 0.5μm. Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted. They have an oil droplet, and a translucent pedicel (a small stalk) up to 2.5μm long. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 10–12.5μm long by 5–7.5μm wide. The capillitium comprises short, highly branched (resembling antlers) and entangled <b>threads</b> measuring 5–10μm wide with walls up to 2.5μm thick.

The resulting <b>thread</b> form has the same low friction properties as a square <b>thread</b> form but at about twice the shear strength due to the long <b>thread</b> base. This <b>thread</b> form also is easy to machine on a <b>thread</b> milling machine, unlike the difficult to machine square <b>thread</b> form.
