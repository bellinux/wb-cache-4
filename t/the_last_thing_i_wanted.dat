500|$|A {{backlash}} against grunge {{began to develop}} in Seattle; in late 1992 Jonathan Poneman {{said that in the}} city, [...] "All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [...] Because the whole thing is a fabricated movement and always has been." [...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be."

500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Miller {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson: [...] "There's a real hope. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do is another Mad Max, but this script came along, and I'm completely carried away with it." [...] The film's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles. Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative. However, he {{stated that he}} thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age. Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008. On 5 March 2009, it was announced that an R-rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road, although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a [...] "different route", a [...] "renaissance" [...] of the franchise. Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for {{what he wanted to do}} with the franchise. Miller was also developing an action-adventure tie-in video game based on the fourth film, along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years, according to Miller, with a release date of either 2011 or 2012. Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios, a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} one splendid morning, all blue and silver, {{in the summer}} holidays when I reluctantly tore myself away from the task of doing nothing in particular, {{and put on a}} hat of some sort and picked up a walking-stick, and put six very bright-coloured chalks in my pocket. I then went into the kitchen (which, {{along with the rest of}} the house, belonged to a very square and sensible old woman in a Sussex village), and asked the owner and occupant of the kitchen if she had any brown paper. She had a great deal; in fact, she had too much; and she mistook the purpose and the rationale of the existence of brown paper. She seemed to have an idea that if a person wanted brown paper he must be wanting to tie up parcels; which was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do; indeed, it is a thing which I have found to be beyond my mental capacity. Hence she dwelt very much on the varying qualities of toughness and endurance in the material. I explained to her that I only wanted to draw pictures on it, and that I did not want them to endure in the least; and that from my point of view, therefore, it was a question, not of tough consistency, but of responsive surface, a thing comparatively irrelevant in a parcel. When she understood that I wanted to draw she offered to overwhelm me with note-paper, apparently supposing that I did my notes and correspondence on old brown paper wrappers from motives of economy.|$|E

5000|$|Olson {{has said}} that while he campaigned for George W. Bush in 2000, he did not support his {{re-election}} in 2004: [...] "Foreign policy and defense blunders aside, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> was an administration combining aggressive social conservatism with uncontrolled spending and big new government programs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Green {{moved on}} to the Sunday Pictorial (as the Sunday Mirror was then named) in 1959 filling the same post as before. Since 1955, her {{immediate}} boss had been Lee Howard, and she became associate editor of the Daily Mirror in 1961 when Howard was appointed as the newspaper's editor. Green recalled her new colleagues response to her: [...] "They were all being as helpfully 'feminine' as they could, which was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted.</b> My plan was to make the pages interesting to men, too." ...|$|E

The Daytona 500 is - {{as a kid}} what you - this is the {{pinnacle}} of our sport and I’m just proud to be here. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was wreck off turn four with my Toyota teammates {{and none of us}} win.

5000|$|Everything {{came to a}} {{grinding}} halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run {{for almost two decades}} but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that “... {{no one wants to be}} the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn’t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to become was one of them.” [...] - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again.|$|E
5000|$|Hamm {{continued}} {{working as}} a waiter and, briefly, as a set designer for a softcore pornography movie. After repeatedly failing to get promising roles, Hamm set his 30th birthday as a deadline to succeed in Hollywood, stating: [...] You either suck that up and find another agent, or {{you go home and}} say you gave it a shot, but that's the end of that. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be out here was one of those actors who's 45 years old, with a tenuous grasp of their own reality, and not really working much. So I gave myself five years. I said, if I can't get it going by the time I'm 30, I'm in the wrong place. And as soon as I said that, it's like I started working right away.|$|E

Ressler, {{the executive director of}} vehicle engineering for Ford Motor Company at the time and one of the founding fathers of SVT, the 1993 Cobra R's brakes [...] "were the most expensive brakes ever fitted to a production Mustang. I bought the brakes for the R model out of my engineering budget. I wanted big brakes, and we didn't have them. The program couldn't afford it. Unbeknownst to the higher-ups at Ford, I spent like $2,100 per car to buy those big brakes. But <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> was a fast car that didn't stop. We ended up putting good brakes on all those R vehicles." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} Franck Vestiel's {{first as a}} director. Eden Log uses a muted palette. The film is shot with only {{hand-held}} cameras in underground locations 60 ft below the surface, {{as well as in}} a sewer. A gray and blue multilevel set is used in Eden Log, which, according to Vestiel, was designed to [...] "avoid the look of the usual science fiction future ... <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> was for Eden Log to fall into the trap of those science fiction films where the characters live in super-sterile, bathroom-like environments. ... And I did not want {{people to be able to}} date the film by identifying the technology, which is why I have no apparatuses, no dials, no buttons." [...] The surrealistic landscapes of Eden Log were inspired by Vestiel's favorite films, such as Escape From New York and Dawn of the Dead, and comics and literature, such as Frank Miller's Daredevil and Métal Hurlant.|$|E
5000|$|Director Craig Gillespie {{said that}} he had been hoping to recruit A. R. Rahman to do the music right from the time the former signed the Disney film to helm the project. In an {{interview}} with CBS News, Rahman stated that the film's scale was very attractive to him. He began composing for the film's score in 2013, setting seven queues of score to be featured on the soundtrack album. Eventually, the number of tracks increased as per screenplay length. The recording of the score was completed by February 2014. On working for the film he stated, [...] "For three years, I was avoiding Indian-based subjects in Hollywood as I was anyway doing them in Hindi. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> was to be typecast as a composer who'd only work on English films with an Indian setting. But when this script came along, I {{thought it was a good}} time to start again. It helped that the story was also hybrid in nature. Million Dollar Arm is more contemporary. In terms of music, it is more orchestral." ...|$|E
