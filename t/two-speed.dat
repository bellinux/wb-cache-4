5|$|Single-stage, <b>two-speed</b> gearbox: {{experimental}} Merlin X (1938), production Merlin XX (1940–1945).|$|E
5|$|Two-stage, <b>two-speed</b> gearbox with intercooler: mainly Merlin 60, 70, and 80 series (1942–1946).|$|E
5|$|The E {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class {{following}} in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F class were repeats of the E's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the <b>Two-Speed</b> Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the <b>Two-Speed</b> Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a <b>two-speed</b> supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the <b>two-speed</b> superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} based on the {{preceding}} B class, but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director control tower for British destroyers. The 'C' class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and wheelhouse separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating <b>Two-Speed</b> Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and ASDIC (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked ASDIC and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C's, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and ASDIC.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of water}} {{modulating}} by-pass systems {{is not recommended}} during freezing weather. In such situations, the control flexibility of variable speed motors, <b>two-speed</b> motors, and/or <b>two-speed</b> motors multi-cell towers {{should be considered a}} requirement.|$|E
25|$|The H2-H2R {{engine is}} a 998cc inline-4, four-valve, dual {{overhead}} cam design with a <b>two-speed,</b> centrifigual supercharger. The supercharger {{is driven by}} a series of gears and shafts connecting the flywheel to a planetary drive, finally spinning a dog-shifted <b>two-speed</b> shaft attached to the impeller. Rider control is throttle by wire.|$|E
25|$|One F6F-3 {{fitted with}} a <b>two-speed</b> {{turbocharged}} 2,100hp (1,567kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-27 Double Wasp radial piston engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine was}} the Packard V-1650-7, a licence-built {{version of the}} Rolls-Royce Merlin 60 series, fitted with a two-stage, <b>two-speed</b> supercharger.|$|E
25|$|Ford F-Series - {{permanent}} {{four-wheel drive}} (1974-1979) <b>two-speed</b> New Process 203 transfer case, center differential with 50:50 torque split and lock.|$|E
25|$|Introduced a <b>two-speed</b> {{two-stage}} supercharger with aftercooler {{similar to}} that on Merlin 61; 2,035hp (1,520kW) at 7,000ft (2,100m) and 1,820hp (1,360kW) at 21,000ft (6,400m); used on Spitfire F.Mk.XIV, Mk.21.|$|E
25|$|The Pegasus was {{produced}} in many variants, early prototype engines were unsupercharged but the majority used a geared supercharger, either single-speed or <b>two-speed.</b> Variant differences included compression ratios, propeller reduction gear ratios and accessories.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet Rounded-Line K Fleetside, K Stepside, K Blazer, and K Suburban - {{permanent}} {{four-wheel drive}} (1973-1979) <b>two-speed</b> New Process 203 transfer case, center differential with 50:50 torque split and lock. An Eaton Automatic Differential Lock was optional for the rear hypoid differential.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} three six-cylinder engines carried {{over to the}} HT series, however the {{transmission}} options for the V8 engines were many and varied. Initially, the 253 V8 only came with either three-speed column- or four-speed floor-mounted manual transmissions. The 307 V8 was only available with <b>two-speed</b> Powerglide automatic. This arrangement continued until the 307 stocks were exhausted, following which the 253 and 308 locally built V8 engines could then be ordered with any manual or automatic transmission across the range, excepting the Holden Brougham which was always specified as a 308 automatic. A new locally manufactured three-speed automatic transmission, the Tri-Matic, was introduced late {{in the life of}} the HT range, except on HT Brougham which retained the <b>two-speed</b> automatic Powerglide transmission.|$|E
25|$|The same {{assortment}} of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the <b>two-speed</b> Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option {{this year was}} a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|Replacing the old Dynaflow-based <b>two-speed</b> {{automatic}} transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The <b>two-speed</b> Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available {{with the standard}} two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine {{as well as the}} 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Timothy Brown (November 21, 1854 – January 31, 1929) was an inventor, engineer, {{businessman}} and entrepreneur in Syracuse, New York and {{was credited with}} over 100 inventions. He invented the Smith Premier typewriter, the L. C. Smith breech-loading shotgun and the <b>two-speed</b> Hi-Lo Bi-Gear for bicycles.|$|E
25|$|The first US patent, US1, was {{obtained}} in 1836 by John Ruggles for a Locomotive steam-engine for rail and other roads. Ruggles' proposed locomotive had a <b>two-speed</b> gear and a rack mechanism {{which was only}} engaged when climbing steep hills. It is not known whether it was actually built.|$|E
25|$|The <b>two-speed</b> Jetaway {{automatic}} {{that was}} previously offered {{as an option}} on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely {{in favor of the}} GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option.|$|E
25|$|Engines were {{unchanged}} {{from previous}} years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The <b>two-speed</b> Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres {{and all other}} full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a Leyland 313 {{turbocharged}} water-cooled four-stroke diesel engine coupled to a five-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox and <b>two-speed</b> transfer case. There is permanent (4 × 4) drive. The front axle has a rating of 5,000kg, with an offset bowl to reduce overall cab height. The rear axle has a rating of 7,500kg.|$|E
25|$|A <b>two-speed,</b> {{two-stage}} supercharger and intercooler {{were used}} to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{became the}} first chief to test Funny Cars in a wind tunnel. Other {{innovations}} included equipping dragsters with data recorders, installing a two-stage lockup-style clutch, and a fuel delivery system with two sources. He developed dynamometer testing for nitromethane. Some innovations later outlawed {{because they were too}} costly or too fast for the track included a three spark plug per cylinder magneto and a <b>two-speed</b> supercharger.|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a <b>two-speed</b> {{semi-automatic}} transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included <b>two-speed</b> heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} M1070 {{is powered}} by a Detroit Diesel 8V-92TA 12.06-liter diesel engine developing 500 hp at 2100 rpm and 1993 Nm torque at 1200 rpm. This is coupled to an Allison CLT-754 five-speed automatic transmission and Oshkosh 55000 <b>two-speed</b> transfer case. The M1070A1 {{is powered by}} a Caterpillar C-18 six-cylinder diesel developing 700 hp, this coupled to an uprated Allison 4800SP seven-speed automatic transmission and Oshkosh 30000 single-speed transfer case.|$|E
25|$|These {{articles}} {{present a}} brief history of the Spitfire through all of its variants, including many of the defining characteristics of each sub-type. This particular article deals only with Spitfire variants powered by early model Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, which mostly utilised single-speed, single-stage superchargers. The second article describes Spitfire variants powered by later model Merlins, featuring two-stage, <b>two-speed</b> superchargers, while the final article covers the later Spitfire variants which were powered by the larger Rolls-Royce Griffon engines.|$|E
25|$|Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional <b>two-speed</b> automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.|$|E
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: <b>two-speed</b> hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E
25|$|Some luxury market buyers {{purchased}} {{either the}} Starfires {{or the new}} Toronados in 1966 but the 98 remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; windshield washer and <b>two-speed</b> wipers; foam seat cushions; electric clock and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|Motive {{power is}} {{provided}} by a digitally-controlled Gale Banks Engineering 866T V-8 diesel, this based on {{the architecture of the}} General Motors (GM) Duramax. Power output is undisclosed, but estimated to be around 300 hp. In commercial use power output of the standard Duramax engine is currently up to 397hp (296kW) at 3000 rpm. An unspecified fully automatic Allison Transmission is fitted, this coupled to an Oshkosh transfer case. It is currently not known if this is a single-speed or <b>two-speed</b> (high/low ratio) transfer case.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles {{continued}} to evolve {{to suit the}} varied needs of riders. The derailleur developed in France between 1900 and 1910 among cyclotourists, and was improved over time. Only in the 1930s did European racing organizations allow racers to use gearing; until then {{they were forced to}} use a <b>two-speed</b> bicycle. The rear wheel had a sprocket {{on either side of the}} hub. To change gears, the rider had to stop, remove the wheel, flip it around, and remount the wheel. When racers were allowed to use derailleurs, racing times immediately dropped.|$|E
25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a <b>two-speed</b> transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} change {{made to the}} later Merlin (60, 70, 80 and 100 series) and Griffon engines (60 and 80 series) was the incorporation of a two-stage, <b>two-speed</b> supercharger, which provided a considerable increase in power, especially at higher altitudes. Two-stage refers {{to the use of}} two impellers on a common driveshaft, constituting two superchargers in series. As air was drawn through the air intake, fuel was pumped into the airstream by the carburettor. The first-stage impeller compressed the air-fuel mixture and this was then fed to the smaller second-stage impeller which further compressed the mixture.|$|E
