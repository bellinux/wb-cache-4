25|$|In 1837, Palmer {{experienced}} {{what she}} called entire sanctification. She began leading the Tuesday Meeting for the Promotion of Holiness. At first only women attended these meetings, but eventually Methodist bishops and other clergy members began to attend them also. In 1859, she published The Promise of <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>in</b> which she argued in favor of women in ministry, later to influence Catherine Booth, co-founder of the Salvation Army.

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>in</b> my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>in</b> his name.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 10th century {{no attempt}} was made to use a human to symbolize God <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>in</b> Western art. Yet, Western art {{eventually}} required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the image of His own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} colonial years, social {{boundaries}} were fluid between indentured laborers and slaves, {{and there was}} considerable intermarriage. Gradually the terms of enslavement became more rigid, and slavery became a racial caste. South Carolina used Virginia's model of declaring all children born to slave mothers as slaves, regardless of the race or nationality of <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> <b>In</b> the Upper South, there were many mixed-race slaves with white planter fathers.

25|$|Initially, Christian {{lived with}} his parents and many {{siblings}} at Gottorf Castle, where the family stayed with Duke Friedrich Wilhelm's parents-in-law. However, on 6 June 1825, Duke Friedrich Wilhelm was appointed Duke of Glücksburg by his brother-in-law Frederick VI of Denmark, as the elder Glücksburg line had become extinct in 1779. He subsequently changed his title to Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and founded the younger Glücksburg line. Subsequently, {{the family moved to}} Glücksburg Castle, where Christian was raised with his siblings under their father's supervision. Following the early death of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>in</b> 1831, Christian grew up in Denmark and was educated in the Military Academy of Copenhagen.|$|E

This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.|$|E
