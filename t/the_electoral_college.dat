5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory in <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, {{but even if the}} anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b>|$|E
5|$|His death {{came before}} <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> balloted. His 66 electoral votes were divided among four others, principally Indiana governor-elect Thomas A. Hendricks and Greeley's vice presidential running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Clinton {{advocated}} for eliminating <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> {{and promised to}} co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.|$|E
50|$|Elections to the European Parliament {{were held}} in Belgium on June 12, 1994. <b>The</b> Dutch-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 14 MEPs, <b>the</b> French-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 10 MEPs and <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 1 MEP.|$|R
50|$|Belgium {{is split}} into 3 constituencies: <b>the</b> Dutch-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> <b>the</b> French-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> and <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> <b>The</b> first {{two of these}} elect their MEPs using party list PR, but the German-speaking {{constituency}} only has 1 member, who is therefore not elected by a proportional method.|$|R
50|$|Elections to the European Parliament {{were held}} in Belgium on June 13, 1999. <b>The</b> Dutch <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 14 MEPs, <b>the</b> French <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 10 MEPs and <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> elected 1 MEP.

5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan. They proposed {{that a group of}} states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ed Miliband {{subsequently}} won the election, {{the result}} of which was announced on 25 September 2010, after second, third and fourth preferences votes were counted, achieving the support of 50.654% of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> defeating his brother by 1.3%. In the fourth and final stage of the redistribution of votes after three candidates had been eliminated, Ed Miliband led in the trade unions and affiliated organisations section of <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> (19.93% of the total to David's 13.40%), but in both the MPs and MEPs section (15.52% to 17.81%), and Constituency Labour Party section (15.20% to 18.14%), came second. In the final round, Ed Miliband won {{with a total of}} 175,519 votes to David's 147,220 votes.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b> In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b> Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
50|$|The European Parliament {{election}} of 2014 in Belgium {{is an election}} held on 25 May 2014 in the three Belgian constituencies: <b>the</b> Dutch-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> <b>the</b> French-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> and <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> This election was held {{on the same day}} alongside the Belgian federal election and the Belgian regional elections.|$|R
50|$|Abil {{was elected}} President by Vanuatuâ€™s 58-member <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> on 2 September 2009. Abil was elected on <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college's</b> {{third round of}} voting in two days. No {{candidate}} had garnered the required two-thirds of <b>the</b> vote in <b>electoral</b> <b>college</b> in previous two rounds of voting.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the Treaty of Nice - that became active in November 2004 - the number of Belgian delegates in the European Parliament {{decreased}} from 24 (in 2004) to 22 delegates: 13 delegates were elected by <b>the</b> Dutch-speaking <b>Electoral</b> <b>College,</b> 8 delegates by <b>the</b> Francophone <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> and 1 by <b>the</b> German-speaking <b>Electoral</b> <b>College.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was {{ratified}} in 1961, {{granting the}} District three votes in <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> {{for the election}} of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The current {{president}} of Pakistan is Mamnoon Hussain of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). He {{was elected president}} on 30 July 2013, winning a majority in <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> with 432 of 702 votes, and took oath on 9 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

50|$|Abil {{defeated}} {{six other}} candidates {{who had been}} nominated for president in <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college's</b> third round. With the support of Prime Minister Natapei, he secured 41 votes within <b>the</b> 58-member <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> which won <b>the</b> presidency of Vanuatu. He {{was sworn in as}} President of Vanuatu on the evening of 2 September 2009.|$|R
5|$|During the 1860s, Parker {{continued}} {{both his}} {{legal and political}} careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District. By the fall of 1864, he was serving {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> and voted for Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, Parker won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{court cases}} are {{heard in the}} United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and appeals are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

5|$|Greeley {{was the new}} Liberal Republican Party's {{candidate}} in the 1872 U.S. presidential election. He lost in a landslide, despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party.

5|$|In 2001, Northwestern University law {{professor}} Robert Bennett suggested {{a plan in}} an academic publication to implement a National Popular Vote through a mechanism that would embrace state legislatures' power to appoint electors, rather than resist that power. By coordinating, states constituting a majority of <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> could effectively implement a popular vote.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college,</b> {{the vote}} was more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfieldâ€™s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214â€“155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>college.</b> Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Adams won the {{presidency}} by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> votes were dispersed among nine other candidates. This is the only election to date in which a {{president and vice president}} were elected from opposing tickets.|$|E

5|$|Several {{proposals}} to abolish <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> by constitutional amendment {{have been introduced}} in Congress over the decades. These efforts have, however, been hampered {{by the fact that}} a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states, where ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of the states is required for it to become operative.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} {{arising out}} of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College</b> elects a president and a vice president. The new procedure was enacted through the 12th Amendment, which {{became a part of}} the Constitution in June 1804, and was first followed in that year's presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the timesâ€”that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the officeâ€”Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> <b>College,</b> but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E
