5|$|The {{battle was}} over by 4:00p.m. in a {{crushing}} victory for Li Yuan, who <b>then</b> <b>led</b> his troops against Huoyi itself. Although he lacked any siege equipment, the garrison {{in the town}} {{was too small to}} effectively resist Li Yuan's army, and Huoyi fell within a few hours.|$|E

5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are <b>then</b> <b>led</b> by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface.

5|$|This {{small company}} was {{acquired}} in 1944 by two young entrepreneurs: Joan Llopart and Enric Riera. With {{the availability of}} plastic in the 1950s, the company expanded the range of its products and introduced in its catalog sanitary and household products. This <b>then</b> <b>led</b> to the figures of plastic toys decorated by hand.|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} later, the Zimbabwean players {{returned}} to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they <b>then</b> <b>led</b> the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.|$|E

5|$|After another Chicago punt, the Colts {{advanced}} to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning <b>then</b> <b>led</b> the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Arnold <b>then</b> <b>led</b> {{many of the}} {{remaining}} smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress. The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found Trumbull, New York, Enterprise, and Revenge, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as Liberty, which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the month}} the 2/6th had reached Nassau Bay where it secured landing beaches for an amphibious landing by US troops from the 162nd Regimental Combat Team. Once established, the 2/6th <b>then</b> <b>led</b> the way back west towards Bitoi Ridge, ranging ahead of the Americans as the Allies began to {{encircle}} Mubo. In early July, the 2/7th attacked Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north to act in support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge.

5|$|By the mid-18th century, the {{economic}} and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire, from Punjab to Bengal, led to its dissolution. Internal unrest resulted in multiple battles for independence and further deterioration of the region, which <b>then</b> <b>led</b> to formal colonialisation as established by the Government of India Act 1858, with direct control under the British Raj from 1858 to 1947. In 1880, Poham Young CIE, a British colonial officer, proposed {{construction of a new}} strategic town within the area. His proposal was supported by Sir James Broadwood Lyall and the city of Lyall was developed. Historically, Faisalabad, (Lyallpur until 1979), {{became one of the first}} planned cities within British India.|$|E

5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the Chinese military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway <b>then</b> <b>led</b> the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the SWP's {{national}} committee issued an Open Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World and organised the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). This {{was a public}} faction which initially included, {{in addition to the}} SWP, Gerry Healy's British section The Club, the Internationalist Communist Party in France (<b>then</b> <b>led</b> by Lambert who had expelled Bleibtreu and his grouping), Nahuel Moreno's party in Argentina and the Austrian and Chinese sections of the FI. The sections of the ICFI withdrew from the International Secretariat, which suspended their voting rights. Both sides claimed they constituted a majority of the former International.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, {{when the}} {{agreement}} was concluded, Lützow was fitting-out in Bremen. Her main battery guns had been transferred to the German army and placed on railway mountings; {{they had to be}} dismantled and returned to Bremen. The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company. The two navies agreed that Germany would be responsible for naval escort, which included destroyers and smaller vessels. Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation. Feige <b>then</b> <b>led</b> an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship.|$|E

The Terrapins' defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass to wide receiver Chris Wellington was completed for Nevada's first touchdown. With the extra point, Nevada took the lead, 7–6. Wolf Pack placekicker Brett Jaekle executed a 69-yard kickoff to Torrey Smith, and he returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7, with 7:53 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
