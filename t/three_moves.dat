5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} without a clock, but then there is usually a rule {{preventing}} a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely.

5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of <b>three</b> <b>moves,</b> and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
25|$|Pawn {{and three}} moves: White plays the first <b>three</b> <b>moves,</b> and Black plays without the f7-pawn. In odds games with extra moves (pawn and two moves, pawn and <b>three</b> <b>moves),</b> the odds-receiver cannot {{move beyond the}} fourth rank with those moves. Otherwise, White could win {{immediately}} with 1.e3 2.Bd3 3.Qh5+ g6 4.Qxg6+ hxg6 5.Bxg6#.|$|E

25|$|Rybka, a top-rated {{computer}} chess engine designed by International Master Vasik Rajlich, played {{a series of}} handicap matches against strong human players. In March 2007, Rybka defeated Grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest after giving pawn odds (removing a different pawn each time). In January 2008, Rybka defeated Grandmaster Joel Benjamin after giving draw odds. On March 2008, Rybka gave pawn and move (removing a different pawn each time) to Grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili, drawing the match 4–4. In June 2008, Rybka gave knight odds to FIDE Master John Meyer, losing 4–0. On July 6, 2008, Rybka gave Meyer odds of pawn and <b>three</b> <b>moves,</b> winning 3–1.|$|E

5000|$|Mushiking is a rock-paper-scissors-style battle {{game that}} can be played by one player against CPU-controlled beetles, or with two or more players {{against each other in}} Tournament mode or Tag Battle mode.

2500|$|The game itself {{began on}} October 16, 1933 with Go Seigen taking black and lasted {{for a period}} of almost three months. During the opening of the game, Go Seigen caused quite a {{sensation}} by playing his first <b>three</b> <b>moves</b> at 3-3 (San San), 4-4 (Hoshi) and center (Tengen) points. Such a fuseki had never before been witnessed in a professional game, and the newspapers covering the game recorded top sales all throughout the match.

2500|$|Triangulation occurs most {{commonly}} in endgames with only kings and pawns when one king can maneuver on three adjacent squares {{in the shape}} of a triangle and maintain the basic position while the opposing king only has two such squares. [...] Thus, if one king triangulates by using <b>three</b> <b>moves</b> to return to the original square and the opposing king cannot do the same, he has lost a crucial tempo and reached the same position with the other player to move. [...] Triangulation can occur in other endgames and even in some middlegames [...]|$|E
2500|$|The 2/7th Londons were rapidly recruited, {{and marched}} to Burgess Hill in Sussex on 19 November 1914 to begin training.

2500|$|General {{advice for}} the opening {{includes}} rapid development {{of at least one}} chariot and putting it on open files and ranks, as it is the most powerful piece with a long attack range. There is a saying that only a poor player does not move a chariot in the first <b>three</b> <b>moves</b> (Chinese: 三步不出車，必定要輸棋); however this is not to be taken literally, and is in fact often violated in modern Xiangqi games. Attacking and defending the centre, especially the central soldiers / central pawns, are common themes in the opening, hence the Central Cannon openings. Usually, at least one horse should be moved to the middle in order to defend the central soldier; however undefended central soldiers can also become [...] "poisoned pawns" [...] in the early moves, especially if the attacking side does not have an immediate follow-up to retain the pressure on the central file.|$|E

Playing Bd5 at this stage is a half dozen moves slower than Fine's method, but White can still continue to mate in the h1 corner by e.g. Ne6, Bc4 sealing the black king behind the b1-h7 diagonal and leading to Delétang's first net.) 82...Kg3 83.
