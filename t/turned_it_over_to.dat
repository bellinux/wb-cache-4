25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of February 16, at a council of war, the generals and field {{officers}} decided to surrender their army. Floyd, concerned that he would be arrested for treason if captured by the Union Army, turned his command over to Pillow, who immediately <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Buckner. Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest and his entire Tennessee cavalry regiment escaped while Pillow escaped on a small boat across the Cumberland. The next morning Floyd escaped by steamboat with the 36th Virginia and 51st Virginia Infantry regiments, two artillery batteries and elements of the other units from his old command. He safely reached Nashville, having escaped just before Buckner surrendered to Grant in one of the greatest strategic defeats of the Civil War. He never satisfactorily explained upon what principles he appropriated all the transportation on to the use of his particular command". Floyd was relieved of his command by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, without a court of inquiry, on March 11, 1862. He resumed his commission as a major general of Virginia Militia, but his health soon failed and he died a year later at Abingdon, Virginia, where he is buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill {{from the heat and}} the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed. With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E

The final section, from Betheden Church to Hardship Branch, was constructed as a [...] concrete road. The highway from the state-aid {{section on the}} north side of Berlin to Showell was constructed as a [...] concrete road in 1917 and 1918. A [...] concrete road was built north from Showell along a new alignment to tie in with the southern end of the DuPont Highway at Selbyville in 1921. By 1923, the town of Snow Hill resurfaced its Main Street and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Maryland SRC, and Berlin gave its concrete Main Street to the state for maintenance, completing the highway from Pocomoke City to the Delaware state line.|$|E

The Jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and Zhang took refuge in Yanjing. Even though the Song agreed to execute him in late 1123, this incident put tension between the two states, because the 1123 treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors. In 1124, Song officials further angered the Jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures. The new Jin emperor Taizong (r. 1123–1135), Aguda's brother and successor, hesitated, but warrior princes Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Zongwang (...) vehemently refused to give them any more territory. Taizong eventually granted two prefectures, but by then the Jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor.|$|E

500|$|After having {{completed}} the 24-reel cut of Greed, von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives {{that he could}} not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on The Devil's Pass Key and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was [...] "very distasteful". Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out [...] of quick [...] "flash" [...] shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock's version of Greed retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.|$|E
500|$|Standish's last {{significant}} expedition {{was against}} the French, having defended Plymouth from Native Americans and Englishmen. The French established a trading post in 1613 on the Penobscot River {{in what is now}} Castine, Maine. English forces captured the settlement in 1628 and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Plymouth Colony. It was a valuable source of furs and timber for the Pilgrims for seven years. However, in 1635, the French mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement. [...] William Bradford ordered Captain Standish to take action, determined that the post be reclaimed in Plymouth Colony's name. [...] This was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which Standish had previously led and, to accomplish the task, he chartered the ship Good Hope captained by a man named Girling. [...] Standish's plan appears to have been to bring the Good Hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the French into surrender. [...] Unfortunately, Girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board. Standish gave up the effort.|$|E
500|$|During the searches, {{the pirates}} stole a [...] "sturdy, {{copper-plated}} boat" [...] from Cabo Rojo and escaped. The ship was originally stolen in San Juan by Gregorio Pereza and Francisco Pérez (both arrested during {{the search for}} Caballo Blanco) and given to Cofresí. When the news became public, mayor José María Hurtado asked local residents for help. On August 5, 1824, Antonio de Irizarry found the boat at Punta Arenas, a cape in the Joyuda barrio. The mayor quickly organized his troops, reaching the location on horseback. Aboard the ship they found three rifles, three guns, a carbine, a cannon, ammunition and supplies. After an unsuccessful search of nearby woods, the mayor sailed the craft to Pedernales and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Mendoza. A group left behind continued the search, but did not find anyone. Assuming that the pirates had fled inland, Hurtado alerted {{his colleagues in the}} region about the find. The mayor resumed the search, but abandoned it due to a rainstorm and poor directions.
