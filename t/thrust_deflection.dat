This scheme, which combines favorable characteristics of both the A- 6 /CCW and QSRA, employs the flow entrainment properties of CCW to pneumatically deflect engine thrust {{in lieu of the}} mechanical USB flap system. Results show that the no moving parts blown system produced static <b>thrust</b> <b>deflections</b> in the range of 40 deg to 97 deg (depending on thrust level) with a CCW pressure of 208, 900 Pa (30. 3 psig). In addition, the ability to vary horizontal forces from thrust to drag while maintaining a constant vertical (or lift) value was demonstrated by varying the blowing pressure. The versatility of the CCW/USB system, if applied to a STOL aircraft, was confirmed, where rapid conversion from a high drag approach mode to a thrust recovering waveoff or takeoff configuration could be achieved by nearly instantaneous blowing pressure variation...|$|R

40|$|Technology {{developed}} for the Circulation Control Wing high-lift system has been extended to augment lift by entraining and redirecting engine thrust. Ejecting a thin jet sheet tangentially over a small curved deflecting surface adjacent to the slipstream of a turbofan engine causes the slipstream to flow around that deflecting surface. The angle of deflection is controlled pneumatically by varying {{the momentum of the}} thin jet sheet. The downward momentum of the slipstream enhances wing lift. This concept of pneumatically deflecting the slipstream has been applied to an upper surface blowing high-lift system and to a thrust deflecting system. The capability of the pneumatic upper surface blowing system was demonstrated in a series of investigations using a wind tunnel model and the NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA). Full-scale <b>thrust</b> <b>deflections</b> greater than 90 deg were achieved.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{circulation}} control to deflect turbofan engine thrust beyond 90 deg. has been proven in full-scale static ground tests of the circulation-control-wing/upper-surface-blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This powered high-lift system employs a circular, blown trailing edge to replace the USB mechanical flaps to entrain engine-exhaust flow, and to obtain both a vertical-thrust component and an augmented circulation lift for short takeoff and landing (STOL) applications. Previous tests (Phase 1), done in 1982, of a basic configuration installed on the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft confirmed these CCW/USB systems capabilities. A second phase (Phase 2) of full-scale, static, thrust-deflection investigations has reconfirmed the ability to deflect engine thrust from 40 to 102 deg., depending on thrust level. Five new configurations were evaluated and performance improvements noted for those configurations with larger blown span, fences or favorable engine interactions, smaller slot height, and larger radii with less than 180 deg. of CCW surface arc. In general, a 90 deg. circular arc with a smaller slot height provided the best performance, demonstrating that adequate thrust turning can be produced by a trailing-edge shape which may have minimal cruise-performance penalty. <b>Thrust</b> <b>deflections</b> were achieved at considerably lower blowing momentum than was required for the baseline case of Phase 1. Improved performance and versatility were thus confirmed for the CCW/USB system applied to STOL aircraft, where the potential for developing a non-moving-parts pneumatic thrust deflector to rapidly vary horizontal force from thrust to drag, while maintaining constant vertical force, appears quite promising. The conversion from high-lift to lower-drag cruise mode by merely terminating the blowing provides an effective STOL aircraft system...|$|R

The potential gain of overall lift depends highly on the way the engine exhaust jet interacts with the flap system. The most common way to design an externally blown flap system for civil transport aircraft is to generate additional lift by means of a <b>thrust</b> <b>deflection.</b> A <b>thrust</b> <b>deflection</b> directly implies the interaction of the highly turbulent jet flow with the solid flap surface which finally results in an airframe noise source. Within the German national founded research project HIT (High Lift Innovative Technologies) the effect of externally blown flaps on farfield radiated noise was investigated by means of dedicated experiments in DLR’s Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig. The noise tests were performded with a 2 D 2 -element high lift system and an exhaust jet simulator. By means of pressurized air jet flow speeds of up to Ma= 0. 67 were realized.
