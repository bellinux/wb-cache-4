5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> {{protruded}} above the main deck. <b>The</b> <b>turret</b> extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b> Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number {{did not include the}} cost of the guns themselves.|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b>|$|E

5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal {{bearing down}} on the {{recovery}} team, and time and money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> main gun <b>turrets</b> had 203 mm thick {{sides and}} 2 in roofs and <b>the</b> {{intermediate}} <b>turrets</b> were protected by 6.5 in sides and had 1.2 in roofs. The supports for <b>the</b> <b>turrets</b> ranged from 4 to 7.2 in in thickness for <b>the</b> main <b>turrets</b> and 2.5 to 5.2 in for <b>the</b> intermediate <b>turrets.</b> <b>The</b> conning tower was 203 mm thick.|$|R
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to <b>the</b> <b>turret,</b> particularly {{popular with the}} French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than <b>the</b> <b>turret,</b> needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Four of the {{officers}} were {{of the line and}} responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b> In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E

50|$|All <b>the</b> main <b>turrets</b> of Swea class {{ships were}} {{installed}} at Ellenabbsfortet, located at Aspö, {{a small island}} near Karlskrona harbour. The guns were removed in 1936. <b>The</b> <b>turrets</b> were scrapped.|$|R
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. <b>The</b> <b>turret</b> was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company on 7 February 1900, the third member of the class to be begun. She was {{launched}} on 28 December 1901 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1903. The ship {{was assigned to the}} North Atlantic Fleet after entering service. She steamed out of Norfolk to begin her sea trials off the Virginia Capes on 4 February 1904 before joining the rest of the fleet in the Caribbean for training exercises. On 13 April, the ship suffered an accident during gunnery training; the port 12-inch gun in her rear turret flared backward on firing and ignited three propellant charges in <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b> The resulting fire suffocated 36men in <b>the</b> <b>turret,</b> though quick action among surviving members of <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> crew prevented the fire from spreading to the magazines, where it would have destroyed the ship. For their actions, three men were awarded the Medal of Honor. Missouri returned to Newport News for repairs, which were completed by early June.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b> A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. <b>The</b> <b>turret</b> was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in <b>the</b> <b>turret.</b> In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded <b>the</b> <b>turret,</b> knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> partially functional within an hour.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s {{planning}} for a major maintenance and modernization program began. The largest modifications were the electrical system in <b>the</b> <b>turrets</b> and <b>the</b> gun periscope. New periscopes were ordered from Yugoslavia, but the break-up {{of the nation and}} the resulting Yugoslav wars caused delays. The guns were equipped with gun computers and laser range-finders, and some of <b>the</b> <b>turrets</b> also with night-vision systems. The electrical systems were replaced using western components and the guns and gun positions were overhauled. Externally the most visible change was new thermal insulation dome on top <b>the</b> <b>turrets</b> that also gives them a more rock-like appearance for camouflage.|$|R

While <b>the</b> <b>turrets</b> were originally a story taller than the house to provide views of the surrounding area, Larson later had them lowered for aesthetic reasons. The main entrance to the house, located between <b>the</b> <b>turrets,</b> features a portico with Doric columns and a balustrade along the second-story porch roof. The second story {{of the house is}} sided with scalloped wooden shingles, a Queen Anne-inspired element which contrasts with the roof shingles. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>turrets,</b> <b>the</b> roof includes both gabled and hipped sections and dormers, which is typical of Queen Anne works. Decorative iron pieces top the roof's various ridges, and Swedish-styled lightning rods are located in several places.|$|R
5|$|The chassis {{was used}} for both a command tank (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) which {{featured}} extra radios (20 built) and also as an artillery tractor (Artillerie Schlepper 35(t)) by removing <b>the</b> <b>turret</b> and upper hull and covering the gap with canvas (49 converted from March 42 onwards).|$|E
