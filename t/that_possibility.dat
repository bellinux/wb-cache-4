5|$|Hernan rapidly {{weakened}} inland, and it {{was estimated}} that it had weakened to a tropical storm only two hours after landfall. By 0000 UTC on October 4, Hernan weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Hernan re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted <b>that</b> <b>possibility</b> for the depression to restrengthen into a tropical storm. Hernan weakened further as a large portion of its circulation remained on land, while the low-level center became difficult to locate. By 2100 UTC October 4, satellite images and surface reports indicated that Hernan had degenerated into a broad area of low pressure. Hernan finally dissipated at 0000 UTC the next day while centered over Nayarit.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{convened a}} {{commission}} to investigate the explosion {{the day after the}} incident with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February 1918, however, and no problems were discovered, which made <b>that</b> <b>possibility</b> less likely. The commission made recommendations on tighter control of production and handling of cordite that were successfully adopted by the navy. The Japanese Navy considered salvaging Kawachi, but ultimately decided that it would be too expensive and would delay the construction of one battlecruiser by over a year. Stricken from the navy list on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support <b>that</b> <b>possibility.</b> The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{defenders}} ran out {{of water}} on May 8 (according to a report later submitted by Madero himself) and were confined to only a few buildings {{in the center of}} the city. Most of the fighting at this point was at close quarters; as a result, the advantage in machine guns and artillery that the federals enjoyed earlier was no longer a factor. According to some accounts, Gen. Navarro's troops were on the verge of mutiny and he was worried that they would turn on his officers. To forestall <b>that</b> <b>possibility,</b> Navarro began negotiations with the rebel forces. He surrendered the town two days later, at 2:30p.m. on May 10, 1911.|$|E
5|$|Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source {{mentions}} {{him being}} invested by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, {{which he would}} have been unlikely to do if Gerard had been invested by Henry, <b>that</b> <b>possibility</b> seems remote. At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric. Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury–York dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope, who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule <b>that</b> <b>possibility</b> out entirely.|$|E

5|$|The British {{army was}} {{defeated}} by an army {{under the direction of}} Santiago de Liniers, and Spanish authority was restored. It was expected that the British would return, and the whole city started to prepare for <b>that</b> <b>possibility.</b> Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires after the reconquest, and put himself under the command of Liniers. He was appointed sergeant of the Patricians Regiment, under the command of Cornelio Saavedra, and started to study military strategy. After some conflicts with other officials, he resigned as sergeant and served again under the command of Liniers. A new British attack took place in July 1807. During the battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by Balbiani. After a successful resistance against the British, Belgrano resumed his work in the Consulate and discontinued his military studies. Because of his knowledge of French he had a brief interview with the defeated Robert Craufurd, who proposed British support for an independentist movement. Belgrano rejected the offer, considering that Britain would readily remove their support if they had a more lucrative option in Europe, and in such case the revolutionaries would be helpless against a Spanish counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad {{previously}} began {{a sexual}} relationship with the tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson at an unspecified time around the Vendetta plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex {{in the back of a}} gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but <b>that</b> <b>possibility</b> is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.|$|E

50|$|Byrne (2005) {{outlined}} {{a set of}} cognitive principles <b>that</b> guide the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> people think about when they imagine an alternative to reality. Experiments show that people tend to think about realistic possibilities, rather than unrealistic possibilities, {{and they tend to}} think about few possibilities rather than many. Counterfactuals are special in part because they require people to think about at least two possibilities (reality, and an alternative to reality), and to think about a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> is false, temporarily assumed to be true. Experiments have corroborated the proposal that the principles <b>that</b> guide the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> people think about most readily, explain their tendencies to focus on, for example, exceptional events rather than normal events, actions rather than inactions, and more recent events rather than earlier events in a sequence.|$|R
