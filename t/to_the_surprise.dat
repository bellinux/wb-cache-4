5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of all.|$|E
5|$|At the Flophouse, a wild celebration takes place. Fauna, {{at first}} in the costume of a witch, seems to {{transform}} her costume into that of a Fairy Godmother.

25|$|Stessel, therefore, decided <b>to</b> {{surrender}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprised</b> Japanese generals on 2 January 1905. He {{made his}} decision without consulting either the other military staff present, or the Tsar and military command, who all {{disagreed with the}} decision. Stessel was convicted by a court-martial in 1908 {{and sentenced to death}} on account of an incompetent defense and for disobeying orders. He was later pardoned.|$|R
50|$|A {{complication}} {{arises when}} Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray), a lifelong friend of Godfrey's, recognizes {{him at a}} tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey quickly ad-libs that he was Tommy's valet at Harvard. Tommy plays along, embellishing Godfrey's story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Dismayed, Irene impulsively announces her engagement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprised</b> Charlie Van Rumple (Grady Sutton), but she soon breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, Romeo and Juliet {{was finally}} staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> {{of all of}} its participants, the dancers having {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} music's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet was an instant success, and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet.|$|E

The next day, after much prior deliberation, Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott's house and begins unpacking her belongings.|$|E
5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of some in his army, ordered a retreat {{all the way back}} to the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
2500|$|Ozaki {{was opposed}} to militarism and was {{sometimes}} confined by the authorities for expressing unpopular views. [...] He could also applaud those whose beliefs differed from his own. For example, in 1921, would-be assassins rushed into his house while he hid in the garden with his daughter, Yukika. [...] The father {{of one of these}} dangerous young men later approached Ozaki to apologize in person for the actions of his son. [...] Ozaki immediately responded with a 32-syllable tanka poem, which he handed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprised</b> man: ...|$|R
50|$|Earlier, James Wade overcame flu and Mark Dudbridge 4-2 to {{go through}} to his first World quarter-final and Kirk Shepherd {{defeated}} Barrie Bates 4-2 <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> quarter-finalist.

50|$|Coach Dennis Felton failed <b>to</b> {{follow up}} <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> successes of 2008 with {{victories}} in 2008-09, {{and he was}} fired on January 29, 2009.|$|R
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of the town, the {{surviving}} {{members of the}} group returned to San Antonio on December 6.

5|$|Upon release, The Dark Knight Rises {{received}} a positive critical response and was successful {{at the box}} office, going on to outgross its predecessor and become the 18th-highest-grossing film of all time grossing over $1.08 billion. However, unlike its predecessors, the film was not nominated for any Oscars during its year of eligibility at the 85th Academy Awards, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of film industry insiders.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} booked for showing on 3 November 2014 at the Cornerhouse Manchester (UK) {{as part of}} Asia Triennial Manchester 14, and a 161-minute version arrived, {{somewhat}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisers' <b>surprise.</b> <b>The</b> film was well received at this screening.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> fictional <b>Surprise</b> is {{sold out}} of the service in The Reverse of the Medal, being {{purchased}} by Stephen Maturin and employed first as a letter of marque and later as His Majesty's hired ship Surprise under Aubrey's command. Maturin agrees <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>Surprise</b> <b>to</b> Aubrey in <b>The</b> Nutmeg of Consolation, though later novels suggest that never transpired and Maturin continued <b>to</b> own <b>the</b> ship. <b>Surprises</b> ultimate fictional fate is unknown although she was still at sea in Blue at the Mizzen, when Aubrey receives news of his promotion <b>to</b> rear-admiral of <b>the</b> blue in her great cabin {{at the end of}} the book.|$|R

5|$|After the {{foremost}} Turkish troops crossed the fortifications {{and dealt with}} the Bulgarian defenders, they began plundering the vicinity. However, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men were {{standing in front of}} the city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E
40|$|We use {{data from}} the Federal Funds Futures market to show that {{exchange}} rates respond <b>to</b> only <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> component of an actual US monetary policy change and we illustrate that failure <b>to</b> disentangle <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> component from <b>the</b> actual monetary policy change can lead to an underestimation {{of the impact of}} monetary policy, or even to a false rejection of the hypothesis that monetary policy impacts exchange rates. Unlike <b>the</b> recent contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> literature on exchange rates and monetary policy news, our testing method avoids the imposition of assumptions regarding exchange rate market efficiency. We also add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate on how quickly exchange rates respond to news by showing that the exchange rates under study absorb monetary policy <b>surprises</b> within <b>the</b> same day as the news are announced. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows that}} {{exchange}} rates respond <b>to</b> only <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> component {{of an actual}} US monetary policy change and that failure <b>to</b> disentangle <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> component from <b>the</b> actual monetary policy change can lead to an underestimation {{of the impact of}} monetary policy, or even to a false acceptance of the hypothesis that monetary policy has no impact on exchange rates. This finding implies {{that there is a need}} for reexamining the empirical analyses of asset price responses to macro news that do not isolate the unexpected component of news from the expected element. In addition, we add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate on how quickly exchange rates respond to news by showing that the exchange rates under study absorb monetary policy <b>surprises</b> within <b>the</b> same day as the news are announced...|$|R
5|$|Joy and Bing Bong {{try to use}} Bing Bong's old wagon rocket {{to escape}} the Memory Dump, but after several tries, Bing Bong realizes their {{combined}} weight is too much and jumps out, sacrificing himself to allow Joy to escape.

5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of astronomers.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council. Wilson resolved to {{wait until after the}} British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith.

5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E

Its next engagement was in reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> German offensive in the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge. This was followed by Operation Varsity, the last Allied airborne mission of the war. After this, the brigade advanced across Germany, reaching the Baltic Sea by the end of fighting in the European theatre.|$|E
