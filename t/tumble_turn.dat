25|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> {{is to make a}} {{somersault}} earlier with straight legs, throwing the legs toward the wall and gliding to the wall. This has a small risk of injury because the legs could hit another swimmer or the wall.|$|E
25|$|The front crawl swimmer uses a <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> (also {{known as}} a flip turn) to reverse {{directions}} in minimal time. The swimmer swims close to the wall as quickly as possible. In the swimming position with one arm forward and one arm to the back, the swimmer does not recover one arm, but rather uses the pull/push of the other arm to initialize a somersault with the knees straight to the body. At {{the end of the}} somersault the feet are at the wall, and the swimmer is on his or her back with the hands over the head. The swimmer then pushes off the wall while turning sideways to lie on the breast. After a brief gliding phase, the swimmer starts with either a flutter kick or a butterfly kick before surfacing no more than 15 m from the wall.|$|E

50|$|The 1924 Olympics {{were the}} first to use the {{standard}} 50 metre pool with marked lanes. In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were eventually incorporated at the 1936 Olympics. The <b>tumble</b> <b>turn,</b> better known as the flip turn, was developed in the 1950s. The Trudgen, introduced in England during the 1880s, has been completely supplanted by the front crawl, also known as the Australian crawl.Lane design created in the early 1970s has also cut down on turbulence in water.|$|E
50|$|Another {{innovation}} {{is the use}} of flip turns for backstroke. According to the rules, a backstroke swimmer had to touch the wall while lying less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal. Some swimmers discovered that they could turn faster if they rolled almost 90 degrees sideways, touched the wall, and made a forward <b>tumble</b> <b>turn,</b> pushing off the wall on their backs. The FINA has changed the rules to allow the swimmers to turn over completely before touching the wall to simplify this turn and to improve the speed of the races.|$|E
40|$|We derive an {{effective}} {{equation of motion}} for the orientational dynamics of a neutrally buoyant spheroid suspended in a simple shear flow, valid for arbitrary particle aspect ratios and to linear order in the shear Reynolds number. We show how inertial effects lift the degeneracy of the Jeffery orbits and determine the stabilities of the log-rolling and tumbling orbits at infinitesimal shear Reynolds numbers. For prolate spheroids we find stable tumbling in the shear plane, log-rolling is unstable. For oblate particles, by contrast, log-rolling is stable and tumbling is unstable provided that the aspect ratio is larger than a critical value. When the aspect ratio is smaller than this value <b>tumbling</b> <b>turns</b> stable, and an unstable limit cycle is born. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

50|$|Don Cameron Thomson (born October 14, 1941) is an American water skier and {{a pioneer}} in the sport of barefoot skiing. He {{expanded}} early barefoot endurance records from 5 to over 30 minutes and introduced new maneuvers to the sport such as doubles barefooting, front to back and back to front turns, and participated {{in the development of the}} <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> with Terry Vance. Thomson was also a Master's rated 3 event skier, a proponent of water ski technology and of professional show skiing in the United States and Japan. He introduced backward barefooting to show skiing at Cypress Gardens in 1962, and was instrumental in the introduction of carbon fiber in molded skis, and the slalom fin.|$|E
50|$|Prior to September 1992 {{swimmers}} had {{to touch}} the wall on their back before initiating the turn or rolling off their back in order to turn. After September 1992 when approaching the wall, the swimmer is allowed to turn {{to his or her}} breast and make one push/pull phase with one arm or simultaneous double arm pull. Next, the swimmer makes half a <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> forward, resting the feet against the wall. The arms are in the forward position at this time, and the swimmer pushes their body off the wall. Similar to the start, the swimmer can remain up to 15 m under water, with most swimmers using a butterfly kick for speed. This rule change allowed for faster turns.|$|E

5000|$|A special {{attraction}} in the holen tournament was the [...] "Slam-dyols Competition", where contestants performed {{a series of}} athletic and acrobatic maneuvers before slamming home a marble into {{the hole in the}} ground. Pao's routine consists of an out-of-water <b>tumble</b> <b>turn,</b> a 360° spin, and {{what seems to be a}} reverse pike or split. Bab's routine begins with an all-out rush accelerating him to full speed. He then performs a high leap but Senator Cabalfin trips him up. The resulting triple somersault ends with Bab's face buried in the dirt. Polgas takes his turn. His routine begins in a similar manner to Bab's - a full gallop. He then performs a double somersault with a full twist. Upon landing on the ground, he burrows under for some distance, explosively emerges and slams home the marble. The judges extremely liked his routine; it appeared that he would take gold. However, as Tomas and Barbie were arguing in the stands, Barbie gave Tomas an uppercut that almost sent him into orbit. Upon reaching the apex of his flight, Tomas came crashing back down to earth, ending with half his torso buried head-first in the dirt. This was considered as Lumo Team's second slam-dyols routine called the Skywalk Dyols - and Pata Team took the gold medal.|$|E
50|$|Another {{modification}} {{was developed}} for breaststroke. In breaststroke, breaking the water surface increases the friction, reducing {{the speed of the}} swimmer. Therefore, swimming underwater increases the speed. This led to a controversy at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and six swimmers were disqualified as they repeatedly swam long distances underwater between surfacing to breathe. The rule was changed to require breaststroke to be swum at the surface starting with the first surfacing after the start and after each turn. However, one Japanese swimmer, Masaru Furukawa, circumvented the rule by not surfacing at all after the start, but swimming as much of the lane under water as possible before breaking the surface. He swam all but 5 m under water for the first three 50 m laps, and also swam half under water for the last lap, winning the gold medal. The adoption of this technique led to many swimmers suffering from oxygen starvation or even some swimmers passing out during the race {{due to a lack of}} air, and a new breaststroke rule was introduced by FINA, additionally limiting the distance that can be swum under water after the start and every turn, and requiring the head to break the surface every cycle. The 1956 Games in Melbourne also saw the introduction of the flip turn, a sort of <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> to faster change directions at the end of the lane.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the research outlined in {{this paper is to}} provide real-time quantifiable measures of individual foot positioning and force exerted during the <b>tumble</b> <b>turn,</b> as opposed to the single contact point of the currently employed force plate systems [1]. A thin film pressure sensor has been employed to measure pressure exerted on the wall during the turn. Real-time automated image processing algorithms have been developed to measure a swimmer's performance for tumble turns. The algorithms yield performance parameters including contact time, foot orientation, distance between feet, lane position, depth of contact with the pool wall and the perpendicular force exerted per foot during the turn. The system significantly improves the efficiency of the analysis process and provides real-time feedback to the coaches, sports scientists and athletes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe turn {{has been}} {{identified}} as a key factor in swimming performance in all events over 50 m in length, long course and 25 m, short course, with turn time being positively correlated with swimming performance. The turn (time taken from 5 m into and 10 m out of the wall) has been found to contribute 21 % of the overall race time for the 200 m freestyle, where a 1 % increase in turn performance would have resulted in the swimmer who finished third in the 200 m freestyle Olympic final taking gold. Within competitive swimming the <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> is the preferred method to change direction when swimming freestyle. The <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> has been described as the movement of the body around a nearly horizontal transverse axis followed by a twisting action about the longitudinal axis as the swimmer pushes off the wall. Within the literature the turn has been split into five separate stages, approach; the turn; the push-off; the glide; and the pull-out. This paper focuses on the push-off stage of the turn, looking at the angle of the feet at push off, contact time and peak force. Current literature within this area focuses on peak force and impulse, but {{there is a lack of}} data regarding the foot positioning on the wall and its affect on performance, resulting in two conflicting stand points on turn technique. These differences in opinion are concerned with where in the turn you should rotate the body 180 ° about the longitudinal axis, whether it should be prior to foot contact or after, in the push off phase. this paper details the research and development of an automated system that enables in depth analysis of the contact and push off phases of a swimming turn, including contact time, foot orientation, distance between feet, and lane position, and a case study where the sensor has been used...|$|E
40|$|The swim turn {{makes up}} a {{substantial}} portion of the total swim time in competition, and efficient turns can determine finishing positions in many competitions. Swim turns can be a neglected area of performance gain. This is largely due to the difficulty in extracting performance measures that might lead to improvement. An inertial sensor was used to assess the different phases of the swimming turn and the data were then compared to the synchronised video data. As a case study, two elite swimmers, a competitive pool swimmer and an elite Triathlete, were compared as a demonstration of the technology as a potential tool for routine use. The participants were asked to perform their typical <b>tumble</b> <b>turn</b> at two velocities. Timing of the rotation relative to the turn’s push off was measured. The inertial sensor detected differences in rotation between the two swimmers tested. The sensor reported that push off occurred for the competitive swimmer before 90 °and for the Triathlete after 90 °of rotation and was confirmed by video footage...|$|E
