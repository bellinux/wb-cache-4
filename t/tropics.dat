5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in the <b>tropics.</b> In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the <b>tropics</b> is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation {{affects the}} {{precipitation}} distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, {{and throughout the}} <b>tropics.</b> There is also evidence {{that global warming is}} leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the <b>tropics</b> and subtropics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tropic</b> hormones are {{hormones that}} have other {{endocrine}} glands as their target. Most <b>tropic</b> hormones are produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus secretes <b>tropic</b> hormones that target the anterior pituitary, and the thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which targets the hypothalamus {{and therefore can}} be considered a <b>tropic</b> hormone.|$|R

5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the <b>tropics,</b> but {{air in the}} <b>tropics</b> is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn (or the Southern <b>Tropic)</b> is {{the circle}} of {{latitude}} that contains the subsolar point on the December (or southern) solstice. It is thus the southernmost latitude where the Sun can be directly overhead. Its northern equivalent is the <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer.|$|R
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the <b>tropics</b> daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{geographical}} features {{inside the}} park include: U-shaped valleys, 660 tropical glaciers (the largest glaciated area in the <b>tropics),</b> 300 glacial lakes and high plateaus intersected by ravines with torrential creeks.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the <b>tropics,</b> but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E

5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid <b>Tropics</b> (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping {{and the use of}} organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.|$|E

50|$|The area of Earth {{located in}} between the <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer and <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn is called the {{tropical}} (torrid) zone. The points on the <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer are the northernmost points up to which the Sun can pass directly overhead. Similarly, the southernmost points are on the <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn which follow the same criteria. Location at {{the north of the}} <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer shows the Sun appearing at the south of the zenith. The sunniest countries of the world are on the African continent, ranging from Somalia- Horn of Africa-, east to Niger, west and north to Egypt.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tropic</b> Air is {{an airline}} {{operating}} scheduled services. Founded in 1979 by John Greif III {{with just a}} single airplane and two employees, <b>Tropic</b> has steadily grown to become {{the largest and most}} experienced airline in Belize. <b>Tropic</b> Air, the airline of Belize flies to 18 destinations that include Belize, Mexico, Guatemala & Honduras. The airline offers various tours, including the Blue Hole tour twice a week. <b>Tropic</b> Air operates eleven Cessna Grand Caravans (208B) - Glass Cockpit, two Gippsland GA8 Airvans, and one Cessna 172. <b>Tropic</b> Air is also the only airline in Belize to have IATA standard Safety Assessment (ISSA) Certification.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the <b>tropics</b> can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the <b>tropics</b> twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>tropics</b> {{there is}} little {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} <b>tropics.</b> A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the <b>tropics</b> and subtropics.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the <b>tropics</b> {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E
5|$|Several Australian species {{practice}} acoustic and vibration {{behavior as}} {{an aspect of}} courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's <b>tropics.</b>|$|E
