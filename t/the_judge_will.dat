25|$|This {{exercise}} is {{a modified version}} of the Stand for Exam. It is generally used in novice level classes and requires the handler to order the dog to sit and then to move away from the dog the length of the leash. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> then approach the dog and pet the dog's head.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

2500|$|In this {{exercise}} {{the dog and}} handler will set up in heel position at least 8 {{feet away from the}} lowest board of the broad jump. On the judge's command the handler will command or signal the dog to stay in a sit, and walk away from the dog to stand facing {{the right side of the}} jump, about 2 feet from the side of the jump. The handler's left shoulder is towards the dog. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> command [...] "Send your dog". The handler will command or signal the dog to jump over the broad jump.

Each part is identical except for use a different jump for each part. The handler will stand centered between the jumps and about twenty feet from them. On the judges command to send the dog, the handler will command and/or signal the dog to go {{to the other end of}} the ring about twenty feet past the jumps. Once the dog reaches that point, the handler will call the dog's name and give the command to sit. The dog should quickly turn to face the handler and sit facing them. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> then order either [...] "Bar" [...] or [...] "High" [...] jump (it is the judge's decision which jump to use first).

2500|$|Justice Souter {{wrote that}} the majority's opinion did not avoid the {{fundamental}} Sixth Amendment violation caused by judicial factfinding even though the presumption of reasonableness is merely an appellate presumption. [...] "Without a powerful incentive to risk reversal on the sentence, a district judge faced with evidence supporting a high subrange Guidelines sentence will do the appropriate factfinding in disparagement of the jury right and will sentence within the high subrange." [...] Because what [...] "works on appeal determines what works at trial," [...] <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> be tempted in turn to perform judicial factfinding {{in violation of the}} Sixth Amendment.

2500|$|Much {{like the}} sit {{exercise}} the down exercise {{is common to}} all levels of competition and has many variations between governing organizations.

Just like the sit exercise the later two requirement as well as the length of time that dog is required to remain in the down position changes as the level of competition increases. The dog is also required to remain in the down position for a longer period of time then during the sit exercise. [...] Also, like the sit exercise, this exercise can be performed in a group and should a dog break the down position the team will usually fail the exercise and thus receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a statute}} grants a power for a {{particular}} purpose, it is unlawful for the decision-maker to exercise that power for another purpose or to frustrate {{the object of the}} statute by exercising the power. The purpose for which the power was conferred is a question of law to be determined by the court by construing the statute as a whole. The judge has to place himself in the position of the statute's draftsman and [...] "ascertain what facts were within the draftsman's knowledge, and what statutory objectives he had both generally and as to the particular provision to be construed". After doing so, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> {{be in a position to}} read the statutory language in its [...] "primary and most natural sense which it bears in its context". In general, the court may not refer to the statement of a minister set out in Hansard (reports of parliamentary debates) concerning the scope of a statutory power, unless the minister has given [...] "a categorical assurance to Parliament that a power would not be used in a given situation, such that Parliament could be taken to have legislated on that basis," [...] which is unlikely to happen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} task of a {{judge is}} to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the rule of law. Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as police officers and coroners, prosecutors or public procurators. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role {{of a judge}} varies between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while {{the prosecution and the}} defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>will</b> then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de la loi ("The judge is the mouth of the law"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.|$|E
