5|$|Early in {{his tenure}} Norreis {{appears to have}} been {{somewhat}} circumspect and did not greatly annoy his monks. The change appears to have happened around 1195, when <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> are first recorded as appealing to higher authority. Because Evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester, in which it was located, <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> could only appeal to the papacy or to a papal legate. Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin, held a legateship for England until July 1195 and so <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> appealed to him. Walter forced Norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates, but the truce did not last long, and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> once again complained of their treatment. They were visited by the new Bishop of Worcester John of Coutances some time between 1196 and 1198, but Norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to the bishop. <b>The</b> <b>monks</b> again appealed to Walter in about 1200, but between the archbishop's preoccupation with political affairs and Norreis's promises to reform, no solid changes occurred.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, {{he created}} {{the first of his}} {{successful}} Monk comic strips featuring monkey-like characters. Knocko <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> was soon followed by new figures such as Rhymo <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> Mufti <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> Freshy <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> Henpecko <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> Groucho <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> and <b>the</b> most popular, Sherlocko <b>the</b> <b>Monk.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Maori chases <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> to {{more open}} ground, where <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> takes up a {{fighting}} stance with his staff. They fight, continuously blocking each other's moves. Finally, the taiaha breaks <b>the</b> <b>Monk's</b> staff. <b>The</b> <b>Monk</b> slowly backs up, trying to dodge repeated taiaha attacks, but is hit. The Maori tries to sweep <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> {{off his feet}} but he flips {{into the air and}} avoids this. <b>The</b> <b>Monk</b> readies histwin hooks as the Maori attacks again. He effortlessly blocks the taiaha then hooks it from the Maori's hands. The Maori tries to come at him, but <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> links <b>the</b> twin hooks together and swings them, cutting into the Maori's stomach. Infuriated, he charges at <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> sending him to <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>Monk</b> kicks him away and quickly jumps back up.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>monk</b> {{was dropped}} {{as one of}} the {{standard}} character classes available in the second edition. The Complete Priest's Handbook did, however, allow for clerics to take on some aspects of <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> class via <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> kit. This version of <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> retained clerical spellcasting and gained unarmed combat skills.|$|R
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber was used by <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> to defend their {{claims to be the}} real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of <b>the</b> <b>monks.</b> Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of <b>the</b> <b>monks,</b> and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica {{and a number of}} his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and <b>the</b> <b>monks.</b> Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

50|$|Later {{that night}} he is {{surprised}} by <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> who leads him to a hidden chamber, containing a statue of the Virgin Mary. Before continuing on, <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> kneels performing self-flagellation. Continuing to a second chamber full of relics, <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> tells Marcello {{that he has to}} swear a secret oath before continuing. However, before being able to promise the two are interrupted by a tolling bell causing <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> and Marcello to flee. <b>The</b> <b>monk</b> asks Marcello to return the following night.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>monk</b> was reintroduced as {{a second}} edition class of the priest group in Faiths & Avatars and Player's Option: Spells & Magic. This version of <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> is a fully playable {{character}} class, but differs significantly from previous incarnations of <b>the</b> <b>monk.</b> This version of <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> gains priestly spells (though from different spheres of influence than the cleric) and retains skill with unarmed attacks and unarmored defenses, but no other abilities attributed to earlier versions of <b>the</b> <b>monk.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his abbey into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the abbey during the vacancy. He convinced <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the conditional approval of Archbishop Anselm, contingent on papal approval. Paschal signalled his approval, and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the abbey itself became the cathedral and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of the abbey became <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited too much from the cult of Thomas Becket.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} {{becoming}} abbot, one {{morning after the}} Divine Liturgy a group of approximately thirty monks rose against Symeon, who drove them away. Breaking the locks on the monastery gate on their way out, <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> took their appeal to the Patriarch Sisinios, who sided with Symeon and sent <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> into exile. Symeon pleaded on their behalf, doing {{everything he could to}} have <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> return to the monastery, including seeking out some of <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> to apologize to them. During his time as abbot, Symeon wrote Hymns of Divine Love (completed during his exile), the Discourses, and many letters and polemical works which have been lost. He also wrote articles relating to his disputes with the church theologians—these survived as his theological and ethical treatises. In 1005 Symeon resigned as abbot of St. Mammas, appointing one of his disciples in his stead, and taking up a more solitary life at the monastery.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{they fight}} with emei piecers against shark tooth and mere clubs. The Maori attacks <b>the</b> <b>Monk,</b> who grabs {{his arm and}} pulls the mere club from his hand. The Maori swings his shark tooth club and hits <b>the</b> <b>Monk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Monk</b> spins an emei piercer, {{momentarily}} distracting the Maori and allowing <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> to punch him in <b>the</b> gut. <b>The</b> <b>Monk</b> tries to stab the Maori, but is blocked by the shark tooth club. He spins and elbows the Maori, then stabs him in both the neck and temple with his emei piercers. The Maori falls and <b>the</b> <b>Monk</b> bows his head in respect for the dead Maori Warrior.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>monk</b> {{agreed to}} <b>the</b> fish's request and {{continued}} {{his quest for}} seventeen years. After getting the scriptures, he returned to China via the river, which was flooding again. As <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> worried about how to cross, the fish came back to help. It asked if <b>the</b> <b>monk</b> had made <b>the</b> request to the Buddha. To <b>the</b> <b>monk's</b> dismay, he had forgotten. The fish became furious and splashed <b>the</b> <b>monk,</b> washing him into the river. A passing fisherman saved him from drowning, but unfortunately the sutras had been ruined by the water.|$|R

5|$|Foliot took an {{interest}} in the Dorset monastery of Cerne Abbey, which in 1145 received the Prior of Gloucester Abbey, Bernard, as abbot. Bernard was an active reformer, and Foliot supported Bernard's efforts, but <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> objected to the new abbot, and drove him out of the monastery. Both abbot and monks appealed to the papacy, which supported the abbot. Although Matilda wrote to Foliot, and interceded on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>monks,</b> Foliot pointed out that he was unable to disobey a papal command.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{ordered an}} inquest into the {{revenues}} and resources of his bishopric, {{along with the}} customs of the see. This took place in 1183, {{and when it was}} finished, the results were entered into a register that became known as the Boldon Book. Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee <b>the</b> <b>monks,</b> a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> rights and privileges exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E
5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared {{was an attempt to}} take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to <b>the</b> <b>monks.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, {{with the}} {{approval}} of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.

Following his death <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.|$|E
5|$|In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger {{attempted}} to investigate Norreis's conduct, {{but under the}} leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the bishop refused. Norries then fled the monastery, while <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals, Mauger was supported by Eustace, Bishop of Ely, and Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. <b>The</b> <b>monks</b> and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> and the bishop over the ownership of some properties. <b>The</b> <b>monks</b> and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge-delegates, but Mauger objected {{to the fact that the}} appointed judges were all Benedictine monks, and travelled to Rome to appeal.|$|E

5|$|Not all of <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted {{to reform the}} Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging <b>the</b> <b>monks</b> {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears.
