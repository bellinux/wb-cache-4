The player, controlling Mustafa, {{explores the}} Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals that move about <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him information about <b>the</b> <b>facility,</b> sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing {{him to find}} and retrieve objects scattered throughout <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to highlight}} the effectiveness of <b>the</b> existing <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> persons with disabilities in public universities while the objectives {{of this research is}} to review the effectiveness of existing <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD provided in public universities, to reveal users perception on <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD in public universities, and finally to outline ways to improve the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD in public universities. This research is expected to help the disabled students to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD provided in public universities as much as other people enjoy <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> being provided. Therefore, this research will indirectly helps {{to improve the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> provided for <b>the</b> PWD in public universities. The methods used in collecting data are through interviews, questionnaires and observations. The questionnaires were distributed to 30 respondents of normal and disabled students. From the results, it is clear that the students feel that <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD provided still need to be improved. From the result, we know that although <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD are provided in public universities, the PWD still cannot move independently and need help from the normal students. Moreover, <b>the</b> existing <b>facilities</b> are not built according to the standards. Two major recommendations were made to the study which are firstly, <b>the</b> number of <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD need to be increased in public universities and secondly, <b>the</b> existing <b>facilities</b> for <b>the</b> PWD need to be improved so that the disabled students can use <b>the</b> <b>facilities</b> efficiently...|$|R
