5|$|The Residences at <b>The</b> <b>Ritz-Carlton</b> is {{a luxury}} {{residential}} skyscraper in Center City in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At , the 48-story skyscraper is the twelfth-tallest building in Philadelphia, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991. One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, was delayed for years {{as a result of}} a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at <b>The</b> <b>Ritz-Carlton</b> site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at <b>The</b> <b>Ritz-Carlton</b> tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each other's towers.|$|E

The feud between Arden Group's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz-Carlton</b> began in May. The Residences at <b>The</b> <b>Ritz-Carlton</b> opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire.
