5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent. Because the series explores {{the tension and}} mentality behind <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their differences to fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds {{on the surface of}} water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E

5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E
5|$|Nesomys narindaensis {{is known}} from a damaged skull, missing {{part of the}} back, a {{mandible}} (lower jaw) with the first two molars (m1 and m2), and four isolated molars (one first upper molar, M1, one third upper molar, M3, and two m2). It is larger than {{each of the three}} living species, and the known material additionally differs from those in a few details that may not hold in larger samples. Total skull length is 61.3mm, longer than in the largest living species, N.lambertoni (50.3–53.8mm). The width of the palate between the M1 is 8.7mm (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni) and the length of the upper toothrow is 9.04 and 9.16mm on <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the skull (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni).|$|E
5|$|Once US12 intersects {{the eastern}} end of its {{business}} loop, it returns to Michigan Avenue for the remainder of its routing in the state. The roadway is a boulevard in this area, a street divided by a central median. It runs through Canton Township and parallel to the Lower River Rouge. US12 intersects I-275 on {{the eastern side of the}} township before crossing into Wayne. The highway is bounded by a mix of industrial and commercial properties in suburban Metro Detroit. In downtown Wayne, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Michigan Avenue split apart, surrounding the central business district of the city and separated by two to three city blocks.

5|$|Survey markers were {{erected in}} Lloydminster to demark the Saskatchewan–Alberta {{boundary}}. Lloydminster {{is one of}} two Canadian cities on a provincial boundary and the gateway to Alberta. It currently ranks in size as the 89th largest city in Canada. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the city rank 10th in Alberta and 11th in Saskatchewan in municipal population. If the city were entirely in one province or the other, Lloydminster's population would rank ninth in Alberta and fifth in Saskatchewan. It is renowned for its booming petroleum industry and the OTS Heavy Oil Science Centre. The highway is surveyed north of the Battle River and south of the North Saskatchewan River. Marshall is the first town southeast of Lloydminster with 533 residents is also the hometown of NHL Goaltender, Braden Holtby. Lashburn, a town of 967 in 2011 maintains the Lashburn Municipal Campground.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, {{and it is still}} used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Route 7 begins at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 1-9 Truck and County Route 645 (Charlotte Avenue) in Jersey City, Hudson County, heading to the west on a four-lane highway that is signed eastwest. The route crosses the Hackensack River on the Wittpenn Bridge into Kearny. Route 7 interchanges with County Route 659 (Fish House Road) and widens to a six-lane divided highway. The route than passes by industrial areas and a railroad yard and then interchanges with County Route 508. Past this interchange, Route 7 becomes the four-lane, divided Belleville Turnpike, with {{the eastern end of}} the Newark Turnpike running in the division between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Route 7. It then becomes an undivided two-lane road, heading northwest, narrowing to two lanes before it passes through the New Jersey Meadowlands, under the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and then the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike a short distance later.|$|E

5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E
5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line will create a loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced all the old stock. By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E
