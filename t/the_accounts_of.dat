40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> Czech company's branch {{established}} in Slovak Republic.

In 1980, a film The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch, was released; it received eight Academy Award nominations. Merrick was played by John Hurt and Frederick Treves by Anthony Hopkins.

5|$|During the Anarchy (1135–1153) rival {{factions of}} King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom and Worcestershire {{proved to be}} a key battleground. The first attack on Worcester itself {{occurred}} in late 1139 when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city. After an attempt to take the castle {{on the south side of}} the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, looting and burning. Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, before joining the Empress's faction. In response, Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict. From <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> these sieges, it appears that Worcester still lacked substantial walls during this period.|$|E

His successor, George VI also preferred his own original home, the Royal Lodge in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth.
