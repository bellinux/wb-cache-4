5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most {{able to do this}} of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
25|$|Golden Retrievers require regular {{grooming}} {{and occasional}} baths. Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but {{are known to}} shed profusely twice a year. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness.|$|E
25|$|In general, it is {{the psychosocial}} model rather than, or in {{addition}} to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work. This may include a focus on social causation, labeling, critical theory and social constructivism. Many argue social workers {{need to work with}} medical and health colleagues to provide an effective service but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be at the forefront of processes that include and empower service users.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{international}} duties in 2009, the Malaysia national U-21 team was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{participate in the}} 2010 AFC U-19 Championship qualification.

Once {{they think they have}} {{memorised}} the symbols, they may proceed to the observatory were they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> match the symbols with the name of the Zodiac to receive their next clue. For Vinh & Terje's Handicap, they not only had to memorise the symbols but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> know the names and their correct sequencing.|$|R
25|$|How can we {{solve these}} problems? How {{can we make}} sure that {{both males and females}} in Ivory Coast have the same level of education? First of all, we can make sure that the parents of these {{children}} keep them in school until their preferred level (college, university, etc.). <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> possess good passing skills and close control {{to hold the}} ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. Deep-lying playmakers typically require a good first touch under opposition pressure {{and the ability to}} play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.|$|E
25|$|Simulated {{patients}} are often {{recruited from the}} local amateur and professional acting community, through advertisements in local newspapers, or by word of mouth. Actual patients who take an active and self-taught role in their own healthcare may also be recruited. Graduate students in nearby universities may also agree to take up these roles. Patients and medical students working as a SP can be paid upwards of $100/hour for their services. SPs need to draw on their own personal experiences with physicians, conversations with healthcare professionals, talking to specific patient populations etc. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be trained to accurately and reliably simulate particular clinical scenarios. Frequent quality assessment {{may be needed to}} ensure consistency in the portrayal of the patient role; especially since SPs may absorb a significant amount of clinical knowledge from their interactions with healthcare professionals.|$|E

25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pick up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E

50|$|Atari {{felt that}} <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> expand the {{language}} to add better {{support for the}} specific hardware features of their computers, similar to what Apple had done with their Applesoft BASIC. This increased the size from 9 kB to around 11 kB. Atari had designed their ROM layout in 8 kB blocks, and paring down the code from 11 to 8 kB {{turned out to be}} a significant problem. Adding to the problem was the fact that the 6502 code supplied by Microsoft was undocumented.|$|R

500|$|The English {{localization}} {{was handled}} by Atlus USA, led by Nich Maragos and Yu Namba. During translation, {{the team had}} a mixed experience translating the katakana names. While names such as [...] "Williams" [...] were easy, names such as [...] "Skogsra", a demon based on a Scandinavian forest spirit, proved a challenge and required specific research on the name's origins. Some of the localization choices were made due to the team's knowledge of Ishida's enthusiasm for western culture. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> create varied speaking styles for the various demons, from middle English to a more modern vernacular, which proved a time-consuming process.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{full-size}} sawmill, the blades are mounted on wheels with a diameter large {{enough not to}} cause metal fatigue due to flexing when the blade repeatedly changes from a circular to a straight profile. It is stretched very tight (with fatigue strength of the saw metal being the limiting factor). Bandsaws of this size {{need to have a}} deformation worked into them that counteracts the forces and heating of operation. [...] This is called [...] "benching". <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be removed and serviced at regular intervals. Sawfilers or sawdoctors are the craftsmen responsible for this work.|$|E
2500|$|Their central {{position}} {{enables them}} to have an all-round view of the match. [...] Since most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played. It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the middle area of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder {{is expected to have}} good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be good at tackling to win the ball back.|$|E
2500|$|Touring {{sound systems}} {{have to be}} {{powerful}} and versatile enough to cover many different halls and venues, and they are available many different sizes and shapes. Touring systems range from mid-sized systems for bands playing nightclub and other mid-sized venues to large systems for groups playing stadiums, arenas and outdoor festivals. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> use [...] "field-replaceable" [...] components such as speakers, horns, and fuses, which are easily accessible for repairs during a tour. Tour sound systems are often designed with substantial redundancy features, {{so that in the}} event of equipment failure or amplifier overheating, the system will continue to function. [...] Touring systems for bands performing for crowds of a few thousand people and up are typically set up and operated by a team of technicians and engineers who travel with the performers to every show.|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of global incorporation, mission of military equipments were getting diversification. In addition to traditional combat mission, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> accomplish other tasks, such as disaster rescue. These transformations induced many difficulties to logistics support. This paper mainly focused on decomposing operational mission, and constrcuting mission-oriented reliability and maintainability parameter set for equipments. Consequrntly, RM model of baisc equipment combat unit was established, with multiple modeling theories and methods, such as phased-mission system and reliability block diagram, etc. This model could provide the foundation for operational mission-oriented support resource deployment and support efficiency evaluation...|$|R
50|$|Clemens Kirschbaum and {{his colleagues}} at the University of Trier sought to {{overcome}} these limitations by combining different stress-generating tasks in a highly standardized format, which included elements of public speaking, mental arithmetic, and anticipation. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> design a task that would be mild enough to be approved by most human subjects protection committees. Their task, which they named the Trier social stress test, consistently produced very large physiological effects in the majority of their participants, thus overcoming the limitations of earlier research. They first reported on the test in 1993, in the journal Neuropsychobiology.|$|R
40|$|George Polya’s book, How {{to solve}} it (1945), {{is likely to have}} been one of the first books to focus on {{building}} students’ skills as problem solvers. Polya, a Hungarian professor of mathematics, realised that it was not sufficient that his students knew their mathematical facts [...] <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> have a relational understanding of the subject in order to use mathematics as a tool.

2500|$|Heinz Kohut thought {{similarly}} to Freud's idea of transference. He used narcissism {{as a model}} of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut {{had a significant impact on}} the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally [...] "sink into" [...] and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.|$|E
2500|$|Not all plant cells {{respond to}} hormones, but those cells that do are {{programmed}} to respond at specific points in their growth cycle. [...] The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell's life, with diminished effects occurring {{before or after}} this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations. [...] <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> disengage the effects that hormones have when {{they are no longer}} needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the meristems, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved {{to other parts of the}} plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones. [...] They can store them in cells, inactivate them, or cannibalise already-formed hormones by conjugating them with carbohydrates, amino acids, or peptides. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones. Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{minimum limit}} listed above (MTOea/erm2/fc), mean that EU member states having {{ratified}} the Fiscal Compact and being bound by its fiscal provisions, {{are obliged to}} select a MTO which does not exceed a structural deficit of 1.0% of GDP at maximum {{if they have a}} debt-to-GDP ratio significantly below 60%, and of 0.5% of GDP maximum if they have a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60%. As of January 2015, the following six states are not bound by the fiscal provisions of the Fiscal Compact (note that for non-Eurozone states to be bound by the fiscal provisions, it is not enough just to ratify the Fiscal Compact, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> attach a declaration of intent to be bound by the fiscal provisions, before this is the case): UK, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Hungary.
