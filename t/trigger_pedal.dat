50|$|The KBA {{offers a}} wide range of firing modes: single shot; {{programmable}} rapid single shot with a rate of fire of up to 200 rds/min; and full automatic fire of 600 rds/ min. The cannon functions, such as cocking and firing, are electrically actuated by remote control unit or in auxiliary mode mechanically by a hand crank and a <b>trigger</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The above, however, {{ignores the}} fact that many DirectInput {{controller}}s, such as gamepads with dual analog sticks and racing-wheel controller sets, already map <b>triggers</b> and <b>pedals</b> independently. In addition, many DirectInput devices also have vibration effects. At least one driver, XBCD, gives the Xbox 360 controllers the vibration support, dead zones and (optionally) independent triggers through DirectInput. This suggests that Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller driver intentionally has weaker DirectInput support, rather than due to any differences between DirectInput and XInput APIs. On the other hand, Xbox 360 controller and XInput support only very basic control of vibration motors in contrast with great palette of various effects supported by DirectInput.|$|R
5000|$|Dennerlein {{modified}} a Hammond's pedalboard {{to trigger}} samples of an acoustic bass, and, impressed with results, decided {{to modify the}} manuals to play samplers too. Her performances include solo performances as well as quintets (e.g. her [...] "Bebab" [...] band). In both, she uses MIDI technology and <b>triggers</b> built into <b>pedals</b> and manuals to trigger synthesizers and samples to her sound.|$|R
50|$|When {{performed}} live, {{many of the}} synthesizers {{and sound}} effects heard in the original track are <b>triggered</b> through <b>pedals</b> used by Lee and Lifeson, plus Peart's electronic drum pads. The song was first performed live during the Power Windows Tour and was the show opener on the Hold Your Fire Tour (as heard on the 1989 live album A Show of Hands). The song would be performed during most of Rush's later tours, including the Roll the Bones Tour, the Test for Echo Tour, the Vapor Trails Tour (documented on the 2003 album Rush in Rio), and most recently, the Clockwork Angels Tour (documented on the 2013 album of the same name).|$|R
5000|$|A one-man band or one-woman band is a {{musician}} {{who plays a}} number of instruments simultaneously using their hands, feet, limbs, and various mechanical and/or electronic contraptions. One person band musicians also often sing while they perform. The simplest type of [...] "one-person band" [...] — a singer accompanying him/herself on acoustic guitar and playing a harmonica mounted in a metal [...] "harp rack" [...] below the mouth — is often used by buskers and folk music singer-guitarists. More complicated setups may include wind instruments strapped around the neck, a large bass drum mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, cymbals strapped between the knees or <b>triggered</b> by a <b>pedal</b> mechanism, tambourines and maracas tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a banjo, ukulele or guitar). Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum <b>triggers,</b> and electronic <b>pedal</b> keyboards into their set-ups. In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals enables singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo and/or sing over it.|$|R
500|$|Jazz, blues, and gospel musicians {{continued}} to use Hammond organs into the 21st century. Barbara Dennerlein has received critical acclaim for her performances on the Hammond, particularly her use of the bass pedals, and has modified the instrument to include samplers <b>triggered</b> by the <b>pedals.</b> Joey DeFrancesco embraced the instrument during the 1990s, and later collaborated with Jimmy Smith. He is positive {{about the future of}} the Hammond organ, saying [...] "Everybody loves it. It makes you feel good... I think it's bigger now than ever." [...] Grammy-winning jazz keyboardist Cory Henry learned to play the Hammond organ at age two and used it on 2016's The Revival.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a'low tech'approach {{to producing}} interactive virtual environments {{for the evaluation}} of design proposals. The aim was to produce a low cost alternative to such expensive installations as CAVE virtual reality systems. The system utilises a library of pre-rendered animation, video and audio files and hence is not reliant on powerful hardware to produce real time simulation. The participant sits astride a bicycle exercise machine and animation is <b>triggered</b> by the <b>pedal</b> revolution. Navigation is achieved by steering along and around the streets of the animated design. This project builds on the work of Desmond Hii. (Hii, 1997) The innovations are the bicycle interface and the application to urban scale simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Geddy Lee's high-register vocal {{style has}} always been a {{signature}} of the band - and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially {{during the early years of}} Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. A review in The New York Times opined Lee's voice [...] "suggests a munchkin giving a sermon". Although his voice has softened, it is often described as a [...] "wail". His instrumental abilities, on the other hand, are rarely criticized. He has cited Jeff Berlin, Jack Casady, John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Chris Squire as the bassists who had the biggest impact on his playing style. An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and ability on the bass guitar have proven influential in the rock and heavy metal genres, inspiring such players as Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, John Myung of Dream Theater, Les Claypool of Primus, and Cliff Burton of Metallica among others. Lee is notable for his ability to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously. This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, sing, manipulate keyboards, and <b>trigger</b> foot <b>pedals</b> as in the song [...] "Tom Sawyer". Because of this, he remains in one place during songs with complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{frequently}} ignored {{safety regulation}} {{mentioned in the}} report was the [...] "deadman's pedal", which a locomotive engineer had to keep depressed for the train to remain underway. [...] Were he to fall asleep or pass out, his foot would slip from the <b>pedal,</b> <b>triggering</b> an alarm and engaging the train's brakes automatically a few seconds later. [...] However, many engineers found this tiresome and bypassed the pedal by placing a heavy weight (often a worn out brake shoe) on it. [...] It was uncertain whether the pedal had been bypassed {{in this case because}} the lead locomotive of the train had been destroyed. [...] A more advanced safety device was available, the reset safety control (RSC), which required crew members to take an action such as pushing a button at regular intervals, or else automatic braking would occur, but neither lead locomotive was equipped with this safety feature. [...] While the second locomotive in the freight train was equipped with RSC, it was not assigned as the lead locomotive because it lacked a [...] "comfort cab". [...] Management and union practice was to place more comfortable locomotives at the front of trains, even at the expense of safety.|$|R
