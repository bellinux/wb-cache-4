40|$|A {{prototype}} {{data acquisition}} and processing system is developed {{for evaluating the}} insulation condition of a power transformer winding in real-time. The Transformer Insulation Condition Monitoring System (TICMS) evaluates the insulation condition by calculating the winding <b>transadmittance</b> function. The winding <b>transadmittance</b> function is used to fingerprint the insulation system and provides a means of monitoring its condition. The use of a transfer function for evaluating the insulation condition of a power transformer winding was proposed by Malewski and Poulin in 1988 [6, Chapter 1]. The work described in this thesis extends their work {{in a number of}} important areas and makes the following contributions to the state-of-the-art. Firstly, the TICMS is able to calculate the <b>transadmittance</b> function to 3 MHz, which is sufficient to detect breakdown between individual turns in an Extra High Voltage (EHV) transformer. This is a key distinguishing feature of this work and is important as faults between individual turns can quickly snowball into a catastrophic failure. Previous attempts have been successful at determining the <b>transadmittance</b> function to around 1. 5 MHz, which only allows breakdown between discs to be detected in an EHV transformer. Second, the TICMS is able to determine the <b>transadmittance</b> function on-line and in real-time for a fully energised transformer. This is another key distinguishing feature of this work as it allows action to be taken to remove a faulty transformer from service prior to catastrophic failure. Previous attempts have calculated the <b>transadmittance</b> function in an offline situation over a period of minutes using pre-recorded data. Recent advances in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology and the availability of high speed Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) have made it possible to extend the work of Malewski and Poulin as described above. This thesis describes the key design features of the TICMS which provide it with the ability to determine the <b>transadmittance</b> function over a 3 MHz bandwidth in real-time. These features include the application of an excitation with tailored spectral characteristics, a novel transducer arrangement that allows the effective dynamic range of the digitizer to be extended {{and at the same time}} online measurements to be performed, a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory arrangement that allows the high speed data acquisition section to easily interlace to the data processing section, and a powerful 32 -bit floating point Digital Signal Processor (DSP) that enables the trans admittance function to be determined in real-time. The graphical user interlace to the laboratory prototype is also presented. Also described are the signal processing techniques, both applied and developed, that are used by the TICMS to determine the trans admittance function in real-time. These include the deconvolution of the voltage and current channel transducer output signals, a radix- 2 decimation-in-time (DIT) fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that transforms the voltage and current channel inputs into the frequency domain simultaneously, the calculation of the <b>transadmittance</b> function magnitude and phase from the recorded transients, and a zooming algorithm that is used to accurately determine pole height. The <b>transadmittance</b> function of a 7. 5 kVA 11 kV/ 230 V distribution transformer is determined and compared with that obtained by performing a time consuming sweep frequency test. Artificial faults are inserted into a 2 nd 7. 5 kVA 11 kV/ 230 V distribution transformer to establish relationships between the location and size of a fault and the corresponding changes in the <b>transadmittance</b> function. Sets of tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of fault size, fault location, the introduction of simulated partial discharges, and single turn faults. The ability of the system to detect single turn faults is a key feature as this allows faults to be detected before they can snowball into catastrophic failures. The effect of temperature on the location and height of poles in the <b>transadmittance</b> function of a 7. 5 kVA 11 kV/ 220 V distribution transformer is established through the use of the TICMS. On-line testing of an energised transformer is performed to evaluate the effect of supply voltage magnitude, load current magnitude, and the point in the 50 Hz AC cycle when the insulation test is initiated. This information allows the system to compare successive <b>transadmittance</b> functions and generate an alarm signal if insulation condition degradation is found to have taken place. This information will allow the system to eventually become a 'black box' that permanently sits beside a transformer continuously evaluating insulation condition...|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{new class}} of disk, contour-mode, piezoelectric, micromechanical {{resonators}} based on single-crystal Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 As films has been developed. The shape of the disk resonator is based on the velocity propagation profile of the elastic wave in the plane of the piezoelectric film, with lateral dimensions scaled to the half wave length of the desired resonance frequency. The resonators are designed with supports to emulate free-free boundary conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) model for this resonator is created in Ansys software, the simulation results validate the design concept. The performance parameters extracted from the FEA models show that this novel disk resonator outperforms the beam type counterpart. A unique 7 -mask MEMS fabrication process based on the epitaxial, heterostructure Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 As films has been developed and successfully implemented to produce the prototypes of the new disk resonators. Fully experimental characterizations on the prototypes were conducted and the measured results from the prototypes are: a Q factor of 7031 at 30. 2 MHz with 1. 11 k&# 937; intrinsic motional resistance; a Q factor of 6515 at 40. 8 MHz with 1. 26 k&# 937; intrinsic motional resistance; a Q factor of 3300 at 62. 3 MHz with 2. 43 k&# 937; intrinsic motional resistance. The measured power handling level is about 1. 6 mW, which is the highest power handling capability to date. These measured performance aspects are better than that of the previously developed beam type resonators. Based on this new disk resonator, two novel, two-port resonators (i. e., filters) designs have been introduced. The FEA models of both designs were created and the simulation results verify these design concepts. Equivalent circuit models for these filters were established with the parameters obtained from the FEA models. Furthermore, the optimal electrode configuration to provide minimum insertion loss is obtained through the analytical <b>transadmittance</b> function of the equivalent circuit. The prototypes of the filters were successfully fabricated. Measured results on these prototypes are summarized here: for the circular patter design, the best insertion loss is - 45. 7 dB at 37. 8 MHz with quality factor 4372; for the half plane electrode design, the best insertion loss is - 42. 8 dB at 38. 1 MHz with quality factor 3632...|$|E
