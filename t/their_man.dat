5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for <b>their</b> <b>man</b> of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as <b>their</b> <b>man</b> of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E

The Romanians made <b>their</b> <b>man</b> advantage pay; their 3–1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.|$|E

5|$|Cleared of any {{responsibility}} for McKay's death, Byrne collected his £200 prize money, {{and as the}} winner {{earned the right to}} fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £250 plus an additional £250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid £200. Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew <b>their</b> <b>man</b> in the 33rd round.|$|E

Adultery is violating the property right of a man.

25|$|In {{association}} football, {{the award}} typically {{goes to a}} player on the winning side. Players who score a hat-trick, or goalkeepers who keep a clean sheet under resounding pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball {{whether or not they}} are officially named man of the match. However, not all tournaments/leagues have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites/newspapers instead. In the Premier League, for example, a player will receive a small black and gold trophy, 20 centimeters in height, 6.4 centimeters in width and 6.4 centimeters in depth, for <b>their</b> <b>man</b> of the match performance.|$|E

The fee of £5,000 was a world football transfer record, and represented the only time a Scottish team has broken the record. So eager were the Falkirk supporters to land <b>their</b> <b>man</b> that they themselves raised money for the purchase by setting up a public conscription. Puddefoot himself earned a £390 fee for agreeing the transfer.

25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men {{will allow them to}} interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find <b>their</b> <b>man</b> in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be in a totally different position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E

The Bishop of Pittsburgh called to urge him to accept, as did a group of Pittsburgers who called themselves the 'Golf Club crowd'. He ultimately did, and in 1955 launched {{what he called the}} interdenominational 'Pittsburgh Experiment,' seeking to bring Christianity into everyday life, and about which he wrote The Experiment of Faith(1957).

The bosses had chosen <b>their</b> <b>man,</b> but his nomination was not a given—many, including organized labor, felt Wilson was an inexperienced newcomer. Nevertheless, the bosses marshaled their forces at the party convention, and on September 14 Wilson was nominated, despite his endorsement of the local option on the liquor issue in opposition to his political machine. He submitted his letter of resignation to Princeton on October 20.|$|E

The race authorities informed Benetton that <b>their</b> <b>man</b> had been penalised 5sec for his transgression but they did not realise that it was a stop/go penalty and did not call Schumacher in, so he was black-flagged; which he ignored for six laps. For failing to respond to the black flag, Schumacher was disqualified, having finished second on the road. Hill won the race at 125.609mph from Jean Alesi in the Ferrari and Mika Häkkinen (McLaren).|$|E

25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} WBO Heavyweight Champion Sultan Ibragimov at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 23 February 2008 {{to unify}} the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov {{proved to be a}} huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov into a corner and proceeded to push down Ibragimov's glove with his left hand so he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round, the crowd in New York City began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give <b>their</b> <b>man</b> any meaningful advice. Klitschko did not fight again in the United States until 2015 where he defeated Bryant Jennings.|$|E
25|$|The {{civil war}} era in Norway (Norwegian: borgerkrigstiden) {{is the history}} of Norway between 1130 and 1240. During this time a series of civil wars were fought between rival kings and pretenders to the throne. The reasons for the war was the weak {{succession}} of King Sigurd the Crusader, leaving the country between his bastard son Magnus and his alleged (but uncertain) brother, Harald Gillekrist, who were on bad terms long before King Sigurd died. The goal of the warring parties was always to put <b>their</b> <b>man</b> on the throne, starting with the death of King Sigurd the Crusader in 1130, a supposedly adored monarch. In {{the first decades of the}} civil wars, alliances shifted and centered on the person of a king or pretender, but eventually, towards the end of the 12th century, two rival parties emerged, known as the Birkebeiner and the Bagler. After these two parties were reconciled in 1217, a more ordered system of government centered on the king was gradually able to bring an end to the frequent risings. The failed rising of duke Skule Bårdsson in 1240 was the final event of the civil war era.|$|E
25|$|Whether Norie-Miller {{simply did}} not take to {{political}} life, or found it clashed too greatly with his business responsibilities or if he just felt {{he was too old}} at 76 to give Parliament its proper attention, he decided not to contest the 1935 general election in November that year. There had clearly been some confusion about his candidacy and its joint support by local Liberal and Conservative Associations. Shortly before the election, a Captain Harry Houldsworth, looked set to contest the seat as a National Conservative but suddenly withdrew claiming he had misunderstood the local position and in the belief that Norie-Miller wished to continue. There was division in the Conservative ranks about whether to renew support for Norie-Miller. On 26 October, Norie-Miller did withdraw from the electoral race, citing medical reasons and the confusion of the position but the Unionists did not re-select Captain Houldsworth as <b>their</b> <b>man,</b> turning instead to Thomas Hunter, who was described in The Times newspaper as the Lord Provost of Perth and who could also rely on Liberal support. So no Liberal candidate of any stripe contested the 1935 general election in Perth which was won by the Unionists in a straight fight with Labour.|$|E
