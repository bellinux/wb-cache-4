The variables influencing travel pattern choices are investigated using: (a) Cluster Analysis (CA), grouping and characterizing the Traffic Zones (17), proposing the independent variable called Origin Cluster and, (b) Decision Tree (DT) to find a priori unknown relations among socioeconomic characteristics, land use attributes of the origin TZ and destination choices. The analysis {{was based on the}} origin-destination home-interview survey carried out in SPMA in 1997. The DT application revealed the variables of greatest influence on the travel pattern choice. The most important independent variable considered by DT is car ownership, followed by the Use of Transportation ""credits"" for <b>Transit</b> <b>tariff,</b> and, finally, activity participation variables and Origin Cluster. With these results, it was possible to analyze the influence of a family income, car ownership, position of the individual in the family, use of transportation ""credits"" for <b>transit</b> <b>tariff</b> (mainly for travel mode sequence choice), activities participation (activity sequence choice) and Origin Cluster (destination/travel distance choice).

In the 12th Century are a weekly markets in town. Starting in 1387 two yearly markets opened and by the 19th Century that it had increased to eight yearly markets. The local industry covered only the simplest needs of the city and its limited market area. The limited industry and area provided too little money to support the formation of trade-oriented guilds. Diessenhofen was never dominated by a single industry or a special craft. It never was involved in the international Lake Constance trade industry. The town's location on the Rhine favored the development of fisheries, and it benefited from the salt trade.

40|$|This thesis project {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a Cost-Benefit Model (CBM) for shipping in the Arctic, considering the requirements outlined in the newly adopted Polar Code. The model is constructed to provide a live feasibility decision making tool for comparing vessels transit times, expenses, operational limitations and need for icebreaker escort; on either the Northwest Passage, Northern Sea Route, Suez Canal Route, or the Panama Canal Route. The model inputs ship parameters, ice conditions, and economic factors including: additional insurance premiums, canal tolls & <b>transit</b> <b>tariffs,</b> port fees, competent crew costs, bunker price, and unexpected maintenance costs due to ice damage. The model was developed using relevant information gathered from literature on both economic feasibility studies and ship-ice interactions, as well as from interviews with ship owners and operators with invested interests in Arctic shipping. The CBM is used to run a research simulation for two cases studies representing the highest and lowest cost differentials between the southern and northern routes. From these two case studies, it was found that fuel costs are the largest contributor to total voyage expense and that this cost is directly influenced by the ship speed in ice calculation routine. A Polar Class 4 and Finnish-Swedish 1 A ice class ships were compared within the research simulation. The results show that either ship on the northern routes is a feasible option as the interpretation of the CBM results must be considered from both a time-saved and revenue earned perspectives. The CBM results are dependent on the ice data input, the accuracy of the voyage, operational and capital inputs as well as the market conditions according to which the results are to be analyzed and compared under...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{problems of}} pollution and traffic congestion require {{the definition of}} a model of sustainable mobility [...] in particular, in large, urban areas. An indirect control on these negative externalities associated with private transport may be pursued by means of policies aimed at improving quality and accessibility of public transit networks. To that end, one popular option is the design of an Integrated Tariff System (ITS) : the crucial question remains whether such a policy can be effective in raising the number of public transport users. In this study, we use a twelve-year panel of 69 Italian public transit providers (with or without ITS) and estimate alternative specifications of the demand function. Results show that the impact due to ITS introduction is, on average, moderate. Results also highlight the importance of taking into account the specific features of ITS, such as its validity over an extended network, the availability of a single ticket option, and the application of zonal pricing schemes.

40|$|These {{site-specific}} installations {{were created}} at Lokaal 01 in Breda, Holland for the State Your Business exhibition curated by Leigh Clarke. As I {{was only in}} Breda {{a week before the}} show was to open, my response was shaped more by my views from far away. In looking at the history of The Netherlands, I noticed that economic transmissions and translation from one currency to another were central to shaping this country. In current times, natural gas is a huge component of the economy of The Netherlands, and the transit of gas through a complex system of pipelines {{is one of the key}} driving forces of the Dutch economic system, once again dictated through the intricate tariff systems  that shaped its past. At Lokaal 01, my site-specific installation created a sense of the huge complex of pipelines that moves gas within the country from Groningen to the south, and that is used as a passageway for gas moving from Norway to other countries, from the north of Germany to its southern provinces, and from east to west, linking Dutch to British gas pipelines. For the sound elements, I recorded continuous spoken word narratives as text fragments and spliced and superimposed those sections over the top of each other to fracture the flow of reading and to build new narratives on top of the original text. At the same time I began working with pipe constructions to funnel the sound, as an intimate experience is created when the listener has to come up close to the opening to listen to the sound. The other aspect of this is that the works announce themselves visually first and through sound second, allowing the viewer to slowly engage with them. Working with a dense economics text on gas <b>transit</b> <b>tariffs,</b> I created two sound works piped through PVC tubing constructions installed in the exhibition space. The Jepma Effect is a sound shred with segments of the text in Dutch, German and English layered over the top of each other, creating breaks in the flow of reading and giving a sense of different transmissions going through at the same time. For the second piece, Route Service Interruption, I worked with the noise emanating from gas pipes, both the constant noise leaks reported by people living near the pipelines and the frequent emissions recorded at compressor sites along the route...|$|R

The interest of this research was to simulate, test and evaluate impacts of a Transit Oriented Development regional plan, using the LUTI modelling tool. Therefore were analyzed evolution of transport demand modal share and dynamics of real estate market and of localization choices of population and activities. TOD is a model of urban development that promotes high quality, mixed and multi-functional densification, located in proximity of transit nodes and corridors, with priority to non-motorized mobility and with the aim to reduce land consumption and car dependency. Multiple TOD examples can be found at urban and metropolitan scale, with different characteristics depending on the socio-economic and territorial contexts, while rarer are interventions at a regional scale. Therefore this research aim to analyze the application of a TOD regional plan, applied to a specific group of regional railway nodes and corridors, selected for their TOD potential. Results showed that some rail corridors initially selected, clearly confirmed their TOD potential and that TOD effects are more evident in areas with good basic levels of attractiveness and of economic dynamism. Furthermore, if policy of densification clearly contributes to concentrate residential demand in urban zones and to limit urban sprawl, further incentives has to be organized in favor of transit use. More interesting effects are in fact found by simulating <b>transit</b> integrated <b>tariff</b> policies between regional train and bus services, as well as interventions discouraging car use, in addiction to TOD urban configurations...|$|R
