40|$|A novel fully {{differential}} difference CMOS potentiostat {{suitable for}} neurotransmitter sensing is presented. The described architecture {{relies on a}} fully differential difference amplifier (FDDA) circuit to detect {{a wide range of}} reduction-oxidation currents, while exhibiting low-power consumption and low-noise operation. This is made possible thanks to the fully differential feature of the FDDA, which allows to increase the source voltage swing without the need for additional dedicated circuitry. The FDDA also reduces the number of amplifiers and passive elements in the potentiostat design, which lowers the overall power consumption and noise. The proposed potentiostat was fabricated in 0. 18 µm CMOS, with 1. 8 V supply voltage. The device achieved 5 µA sensitivity and 0. 99 linearity.

40|$|The recent advancements in neuroprosthetics {{have pushed}} forward the {{development}} of new implantable electronic interfaces between the Peripheral Neural System (PNS) and a robotic limb [1]. One of the main advantages of the neuroprostheses is the possibility to restore the sensory feedback to the patient. This is possible thanks tocustom designed devices able to transduce the external information, picked up by sensors collocated on the robotic limb, into electrical currents to be injected through the nerve [2]. In this paper, a neural stimulator able to deliver bi-phasic current pulses to eight different channels is presented. An Integrated Circuit (IC), implemented in a HV 0. 35 µm technology from AMS has been realized and successfully tested. The impedance at the electrode-tissue interface is highly variable and degrades with time, therefore a high voltage supply is needed to guarantee the selected stimulation current even in case of high impedance contact [3]. For this reason, a voltage booster has been introduced in the design to provide a highvoltage supply to the stimulator output stage. Fig. 1 represents the block diagram of our system: the stimulation currents are generated by 6 -bit current DACs implemented in a low voltage domain tosave power and area. The current is then mirrored into a high voltage output stage, powered by the voltage generated by the booster. Finally, the current is injected into the patient nerve by means of intrafascicular <b>electrodes</b> [4]. <b>The</b> current must be generated avoiding charge accumulation at the tissue interface, in fact, this can cause severe damages to the cells. Bi-phasic waveforms prevent this risk balancing the current injected in the first phase with a second opposite phase. A third phase, in which <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>terminals</b> are shorted together, has been added to eliminate any residual charge. The circuit used to realize this pattern and the pulse diagram are shown, respectively, in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The current can be programmed via-PC by the user in terms of amplitude, pulse width and period as indicated in Table 1. The experimental setup used to test the stimulator (Fig. 4) is made up of a custom PCB, that hosts the IC, and a Xilinx FPGA Spartan- 6 LX 45, used to configure the IC and to manage the communication with the PC. The chip occupies an area of 17. 68 mm 2 (the layout is represented in Fig. 5) and consumes 29 mW in high power mode. First, the capability of the voltage booster to generate programmable voltages has been tested. Fig. 6 shows as a supply voltage up to 15. 8 V can be generated by the booster. The current programmability is shown in Fig. 7, where, using a 10 kΩ resistance to emulate <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> impedance, a biphasic pulse with different amplitudes has been obtained. With this impedance, currents up to 326 µAcan be reached. Fig. 8, shows a pulse train acquired choosing a pulse width of 150 µs and a frequency of 400 Hz.

The parameters were varied to confirm battery design concepts and to determine optimal operating conditions. Spacecraft power requirements are constantly increasing. Special spacecraft such as the Space Station and platforms will require energy storage systems of 130 and 25 kWh, respectively. The complexity of these high power systems will demand high reliability, and reduced mass and volume. A system that uses batteries for storage will require a cell count in excess of 400 units. These cell units must then be assembled into several batteries with over 100 cells in a series connected string. In an attempt to simplify the construction of conventional cells and batteries, the NASA Lewis Research Center battery systems group initiated work on a nickel-hydrogen battery in a bipolar configuration in early 1981. Features of the battery with this bipolar construction show promise in improving both volumetric and gravimetric energy densities as well as thermal management. Bipolar construction allows cooling in closer proximity to the cell components, thus heat removal can be accomplished at a higher rejection temperature than conventional cell designs.
