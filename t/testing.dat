5|$|Animal <b>testing,</b> {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo <b>testing,</b> {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal <b>testing</b> varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include <b>testing</b> disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics <b>testing.</b> In education, animal <b>testing</b> is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR <b>testing</b> for HIV RNA or DNA, or via <b>testing</b> for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR <b>testing</b> and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody <b>testing.</b> In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E

5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} <b>testing</b> sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} <b>testing.</b> Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to <b>testing</b> and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's <b>testing.</b> Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's <b>testing</b> time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated on <b>testing</b> engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component <b>testing</b> on the fourth day.|$|E

5|$|Following the French Grand Prix on 2 July, six teams {{conducted}} <b>testing</b> {{sessions at}} the Silverstone Circuit between 4–6 July {{to prepare for}} the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring. Frentzen was fastest {{on the first day of}} <b>testing,</b> ahead of Sauber's Pedro Diniz. Alexander Wurz's car was afflicted with an gearbox issue, resulting in repairs which limited his team's <b>testing</b> time. Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen for Arrows was quickest on the final day of <b>testing,</b> although his car's front wing was damaged when his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Ferrari and McLaren opted to test at the Mugello Circuit where both teams concentrated their efforts on aerodynamic and suspension set-ups between 4–7 July. Ferrari spent one further day performing shakedown runs of their cars at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Autódromo do Estoril between 5–7 July where <b>testing</b> consisted of tyre, engine, aerodynamic and set-up optimisation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Monaco Grand Prix on 4 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} <b>testing</b> sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6–8 June {{to prepare for}} the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day's fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. <b>Testing</b> was halted when Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR's Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his <b>testing</b> time as repairs were made to his car. Jenson Button for Williams was quickest on the third day. Ferrari undertook additional <b>testing</b> at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with their test driver Luca Badoer who performed practice pit stops and starts, utilising different car set-ups, <b>testing</b> new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic <b>testing</b> {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic <b>testing</b> can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the <b>testing</b> procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic <b>testing,</b> only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo <b>testing</b> for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static <b>testing</b> services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 <b>testing</b> and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and <b>testing</b> services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV <b>testing.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether an allergen that has been prepared from a mucoid strain of Brucella abortus triggers a serum antibody response that interferes with the interpretation of serologic <b>tests</b> results. Fifteen cattle seronegative for Brucella antigen were <b>tested</b> with the SDTH <b>test</b> several times. Blood samples were collected weekly and <b>tested</b> with the serum agglutination <b>test</b> and complement fixation <b>test.</b> Results show that some cattle <b>tested</b> seronegative after each of the SDTH <b>tests</b> while other cattle <b>tested</b> weakly positive with the serum agglutination <b>test</b> or the complement fixation <b>test.</b> All seropositive cattle <b>tested</b> seronegative 4 – 7 weeks after the last SDTH <b>test</b> indicating an antibody response of a transient nature. We conclude that serologic <b>tests</b> results indicating infection are reliable when recorded four weeks after a single SDTH <b>test.</b> If cattle are <b>tested</b> with the SDTH <b>test</b> several times an interval of seven weeks should be observed after the last <b>test</b> to ensure a reliable interpretation of the serologic <b>tests</b> results...|$|R

40|$|Automated <b>test</b> {{design is}} an {{approach}} to <b>test</b> design in which automata are utilized for generating <b>test</b> artifacts such as <b>test</b> cases and <b>test</b> data from a formal <b>test</b> basis, most often called <b>test</b> model. A <b>test</b> generator operates on such a <b>test</b> model to meet a certain <b>test</b> coverage goal. In the plethora of the approaches, tools and standards for model-based <b>test</b> design, the <b>test</b> design techniques to be applied and <b>test</b> coverage goals to be met {{are not part of}} the <b>test</b> model, which may easily lead to difficulties regarding comprehensibility and repeatability of the <b>test</b> design process. This paper analyzes current approaches to and languages for automated model-based <b>test</b> design and shows that they are lacking important information about the applied <b>test</b> design techniques.

40|$|In a <b>test</b> suite, all the <b>test</b> cases {{should be}} independent: no <b>test</b> should affect any other <b>test’s</b> result, {{and running the}} <b>tests</b> in any order should produce the same <b>test</b> results. Techniques such as <b>test</b> {{prioritization}} generally assume that the <b>tests</b> in a suite are independent. Test dependence is a little-studied phenomenon. This paper presents five results related to <b>test</b> dependence. First, we characterize the <b>test</b> dependence that arises in practice. We studied 96 real-world dependent <b>tests</b> from 5 issue tracking systems. Our study shows that <b>test</b> dependence can be hard for programmers to identify. It also shows that <b>test</b> dependence can cause non-trivial consequences, such as masking program faults and leading to spurious bug reports. Second, we formally define <b>test</b> dependence in terms of <b>test</b> suites as ordered sequences of <b>tests</b> along with explicit environments in which these <b>tests</b> are executed. We formulate the problem of detecting dependent <b>tests</b> and prove that a useful special case is NP-complete. Third, guided by the study of real-world dependent <b>tests,</b> we propose and compare four algorithms to detect dependent <b>tests</b> in a <b>test</b> suite. Fourth, we applied our dependent <b>test</b> detection algorithms to 4 real-world programs and found dependent <b>tests</b> in each human-written and automatically-generated <b>test</b> suite.
