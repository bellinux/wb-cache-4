5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex {{was first}} {{described}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862, {{but it had}} no designated type species until 1903. By then, the type species was designated as Formica detecta, a synonym of Iridomyrmex purpureus. The genus {{was placed in the}} subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878, the same year the subfamily was established. Since the establishment of the genus, it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the genus by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> distinct from the genus Iridomyrmex.|$|E
25|$|Under the Lebensborn program, about 200,000 Polish {{children}} were kidnapped by the Germans {{to be tested}} for racial characteristics <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> suitable for Germanisation.

25|$|Trafficking {{proteins}} {{are more}} complex. They include intrinsic membrane proteins, peripherally bound proteins, and proteins such as SNAREs. These proteins {{do not share}} a characteristic <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> identifiable as synaptic vesicle proteins, and {{little is known about}} how these proteins are specifically deposited into synaptic vesicles. Many but not all of the known synaptic vesicle proteins interact with non-vesicular proteins and are linked to specific functions.|$|E
25|$|In their {{attempts}} to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions {{with a history of}} conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, {{with the exception of the}} specified groups, did not have the requisite traits <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> warriors.|$|E

Based on {{his experience in}} the Straits of Gibraltar with Weazel he suggested some modifications to existing vessels <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> more successful in that area. Weazel, with Layman in command, had been wrecked on 1 March 1804 when a gale drove her near Cabritta Point in Gibraltar Bay and smashed to pieces, {{with the loss of}} one man killed. Layman was a protégé of Lord Nelson, with whom he had served in three ships, and with Nelson’s support he was allowed to implement some of his ideas.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at James' office 20 minutes early, he apologised to the {{receptionist}} {{and said he}} was happy to wait until the appointed time. The receptionist nevertheless phoned James, who promptly came out of his office, welcomed Epstein and quickly got down to business. Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down the telephone to him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme. The two then shook hands on a deal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them,</b> and the Beatles, extremely wealthy.|$|E
500|$|Bangalter {{stated that}} [...] "to be free, {{we had to}} be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free." [...] Daft Punk {{discussed}} their method with Spike Jonze, director of the [...] "Da Funk" [...] music video. He noted that [...] "they were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> feel bummed on making music." [...] Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk's material, the duo still owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E

500|$|According to Ratnam, {{the only}} {{difference}} between Divya and Mouna Ragam was the scene with Karthik (which {{was not part of the}} earlier screenplay). Divya, the story of a young woman settling into an arranged marriage, did not explore her life before the marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to give them something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> accept the character without questioning Divya's actions. The story dealt with an arranged marriage— two strangers suddenly thrown together— and how they adjust. Ratnam originally resisted this, but reconsidered because its suddenness provided a clear rationale for the Divya's resistance to the arranged marriage. Karthik said he was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the cast; his scenes were shot in a week, and his role was [...] "but a cameo".|$|E
500|$|Another of the team's goals {{was to make}} players feel {{unsettled}} {{after playing}} the game, and present gameplay moments <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> worry and feel vulnerable. The team incorporated survival horror elements into the game, which were also used in the first game. The game was described by THQ as their own [...] "bid to combat shooter fatigue" [...] using its heavy single-player story focus. According to Beynon the game's philosophy is the complete opposite of the Call of Duty franchise, which was described as short, linear, and filled with [...] "filler content" [...] that would only be a tutorial for the multiplayer content. The team hoped to have most moments featured in the game [...] "narrative-driven", and that all the enemy encounters in the game {{are designed to be}} different from each other. They hoped that by offering a unique experience with each encounter, they would be remembered by players. They hoped that the game would [...] "rekindle memories of Half-Life 2".|$|E
500|$|Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly afterward, telling Cynthia {{she could}} not go with them, so she went {{on a trip to}} Italy with her mother. During Cynthia's holiday in Italy, an [...] "agitated" [...] Mardas {{unexpectedly}} arrived (pacing up and down outside her hotel until she returned) and gave the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia [...] "back to Hoylake". Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that Magic Alex [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious.

50|$|In {{order for}} a {{negotiating}} side's leverage to work in their favor, the threats or promises they put forth must be perceived as credible by the opposing group.

500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a move <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later <b>make</b> <b>them</b> unusable for rail service.|$|R

Because the game, as it turned out, would be the Patriots' attempt to seal the record <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> the first undefeated team in 35 years, Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans can witness [...] "an historic event."

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that the RSS volunteers participated in the Bhoodan {{movement}} organised by Gandhian leader Vinobha Bhave, who had met RSS leader Golwalkar in Meerut in November 1951. Golwalkar had been inspired by the movement that encouraged land reform through voluntary means. He pledged {{the support of the}} RSS for this movement. Consequently, many RSS volunteers, led by Nanaji Deshmukh, participated in the movement. But Golwalkar was also critical of the Bhoodan movement on other occasions for being reactionary and for working [...] "merely with a view to counteracting Communism". He believed that the movement should inculcate a faith in the masses <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> rise above the base appeal of Communism.|$|E
