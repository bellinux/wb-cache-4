[...] Diefenbaker stated, [...] "I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence" [...] {{and when he}} noticed Pepler muttering under his breath, said to him, [...] "You are growling", to which Pepler replied, [...] "Yes I am growling.

However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights".

From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard's poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem [...] "At Anchor" [...] to verse submitted by Stoddard's friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having {{to work for a}} living: [...] "The world has not used us well, Ina; California has been ungrateful to us.

[...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that.

500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
