The system was optimised for the determination of the antidepressant trazodone in plasma. The clean-up of untreated plasma was carried out with disposable C 18 cartridges, using several washing steps. The analyte was desorbed with methanol, the extract was diluted on-line with buffer and preconcentrated on a PLRP-S <b>trapping</b> <b>column.</b> The <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> was dried by purging with nitrogen gas. Desorption (phase switching) of the <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> was carried out with ethyl acetate which was introduced into a retention gap using partially concurrent solvent evaporation conditions. Trazodone was determined by GC with flame ionisation detection (FID). With a 1 ml sample, this resulted in a detection limit for trazodone in plasma of 3 ng/ml. The system showed good linearity and repeatability in the range 0. 01 - 1 μg/ml, thus covering the range of pharmacokinetic/dynamic-to-therapeutic concentrations of trazodone in plasma. Preliminary results for benzodiazepines are promising. They indicate that the use of a selective detector such as the nitrogen/phosphorus detector, is to be recommended. © 1995 Friedr.

To fasten the analysis throughput of proteome, on-line proteome digestion with immobilized enzymatic reactors (IMERs) is a good solution. Herein, hydrophilic supports, such as monolithic poly (acrylamide-co-methylenebisacrylamide), monolithic poly (N-acryloxysuccinimide-co-poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate), and Graphene oxide, were applied, to decrease the non-specific adsorption of 420 proteins or peptides on the matrices. Besides, various enzymes, such as trypsin, chemotrypsin, pepsin and PNGase were immobilized, to achieve high throughput proteome digestion. To avoid the sample loss and contamination, and to achieve high throughput sample on-line preparation, various integrated sample pretreatment devices were designed. Through the integration of a HILIC <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> for glycopeptides enrichment, an SCX <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> for buffer exchange, and an IMER for deglycosylation, the on-line profiling of glycosites could be achieved within 1 h. urthermore, through the integration on on-line protein denaturation, reduction, buffer exchange and digestion, native proteins could be changed to peptides within a few minutes. All these results demonstrate that new sample preparation ethods play important roles to achieve high resolution, high sensitivity and high throughput analysis of proteomes...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{on-line system}} {{combining}} supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography (2 D-HPLC) was developed. A <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> and two three-port valves {{were employed to}} couple SFE and 2 D-HPLC system, which was composed of a CN column and a monolithic silica column, connected by a 10 -port dual-position valve. The analytes extracted by supercritical CO 2 were completely transferred to the 2 D-HPLC system. After separation in two orthogonal modes, the eluents were delivered to APCI-tandem-MS for identification of the samples. In this way, sample preparation, separation, detection, and identification were integrated into an on-line system permitting analysis of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum, and at least 73 components in the extract were resolved with calculated peak capacity of up to 1643...|$|R
40|$|Nanoflow liquid chromatography/mass {{spectrometry}} (nano-LC/MS) {{has attracted}} increasing interest ill virtue of high sensitivity, low sample consumption, and minimal matrix effect. In this work a HPLC-Chip/quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS device {{with a new}} ultra-high capacity small molecule chip (UHC-Chip) which features a 500 nL enrichment column and a 150 mm x 75 mu m analytical column, was evaluated with a drug mixture covering {{a wide range of}} polarities. Excellent chromatographic precision with 0. 1 - 0. 5 % RSD for retention time and 1. 7 - 9. 0 % RSD for peak area, low limit of detection, good chip-to-chip reproducibility and linearity were obtained by using this UHC-Chip. Compared with the standard HPLC-Chip with 40 nL <b>trapping</b> <b>column,</b> the UHC-Chip showed higher enrichment capability and hence gave a higher response in signal detection. Additionally, 4 - 30 times increase in sensitivity was obtained compared with conventional LC/MS, which indicated that UHC-Chip/MS was a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of low level impurities and degradation products in pharmaceuticals. Moreover, satisfactory results obtained from trace drug analysis of serum samples further proved its practicality and potential for use in drug testing and development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Effluent from {{wastewater}} treatment plants {{have been identified as}} an important source of micro-organic contaminants in the environment. An online highperformance liquid chromatography–heated electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric method was developed and validated for the determination of basic pesticides in effluent wastewaters. Most available methods for pesticide analysis of wastewater samples are time-consuming, require complex clean-up steps and are difficult to automate. The method developed used a simple solid-phase extraction clean-up for salt and lipid reduction. On-line sample pre-concentration was performed using a reversed phase (C 18) column, and analytes were separated by back-flushing onto an analytical column (C 8) with detection using QqQ MS. An option to increase MS resolution was exploited to minimize interference from endogenous compounds in the matrix. A better than unit mass resolution was used (Q 1 full width half maximum (FWHM) = 0. 2 Da and Q 3 FWHM= 0. 7 Da), which was as rugged as a unit resolution method, and improved signal/noise and better detection limits were achieved for the targeted basic pesticides. This method was applied to the determination of 11 pesticides, including methoxytriazine, chlorotriazines, chloroacetanilides, phenylurea and carbamate pesticides. The percentage recovery values for these pesticides using the online <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> were within the range, 73 – 95...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{improved}} online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography platform coupled to tandem mass spectrometry {{was developed for}} the analysis of complex polyphenolic samples. A narrowbore hydrophilic interaction chromatography column (150  ×  2. 0  mm, 3. 0  μm, cross-linked diol) was employed in the first dimension, while a reversed-phase column based on monodisperse sub- 2  μm fully porous particles (50  ×  3. 0  mm, 1. 9  μm d. p.) with high surface area (410  m(2) /g) was employed in the second dimension. The combination of a <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> modulation interface with the high retentive fully porous monodisperse reversed-phase column in the second dimension resulted in higher peak capacity values (1146 versus 867), increased sensitivity, sharper and more symmetrical peaks in comparison with a conventional loop-based method, with the same analysis time (70  min). The system was challenged against a complex polyphenolic extract of a typical Italian apple cultivar, enabling the simultaneous separation of multiple polyphenolic classes, including oligomeric procyanidins, up to degree of polymerization of 10. Hyphenation with an ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometer led to the tentative identification of 121 analytes, showing how this platform could be a powerful analytical tool for the accurate profiling of complex polyphenolic samples...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of 20 amino acids and 7 carbohydrates using one-valve switching after injection, ion chromatography, and integrated pulsed amperometric detection is proposed. The {{resolution of the}} amino acids and carbohydrates in the cation <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> was investigated. In addition, parameters including flow liquid type, flow rate, concentration, and valve-switch timing were optimized. The method is time-saving, effective, and accurate for the simultaneous separation of amino acids and carbohydrates, with a mean correlation coefficient of > 0. 99 and repeatability of 0. 5 - 4. 6 % for eight replicates. The method was successfully applied {{in the analysis of}} amino acids and carbohydrates in aseptic media and in extracellular culture media of three phenotypes of Clostridium thermocellum.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of open tubular <b>trapping</b> <b>columns</b> for on-line extraction-GC is evaluated. The extraction step involves sorption of the analytes from {{water into the}} stationary phase of an open tubular column, removal of water by purging of the trap with nitrogen and desorption of the analytes with an organic solvent. The effect of swelling the stationary phase with organic solvents on the retention power of the trap (2 m x 0. 32 mm Ld.) is studied. When using chloroform as a swelling agent breakthrough volumes higher than 5 rol are obtained {{for a number of}} medium polar compounds. For desorption 75 J. Ll of organic solvent are needed. Solvent elimination prior to transfer to the GC column is carried out using a PTV injector and a multidimensional GC system.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} development of novel, fully automatable, online multidimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) technologies and methodologies to accelerate proteomics and glycomics mapping from complex biological samples. Chapter 2 reports {{the development of}} an online two-dimensional (2 D) liquid chromatography (LC) system—with separations based on hydrophilic interactions in the first dimension and low-pH reversed-phase (RP) separation (peptide hydrophobicity) in the second—that operated with high resolution and orthogonality. This hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) –RP platform featured an RP <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> plus a mixing loop before the first dimension to facilitate direct aqueous sample loading; an additional sample loop plus a strong cation exchange (SCX) <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> was implemented to circumvent the problem of solvent incompatibility between the two columns. The performance of this system was benchmarked through analysis of the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in the identification of more than 2000 proteins with abundances spanning from 40 to 〖 10 〗^ 6 copies/cell. Chapter 3 reports a novel online three-dimensional (3 D) HILIC-SCX-RP coupled with porous graphitic carbon (PGC) LC platform derived from the HILIC-RP design, featuring additional SCX fractionations, operating through a charge-centric separation mechanism, to extend the separation efficiency and platform orthogonality; the PGC column was integrated to recapture non-retained hydrophilic analytes for concomitant analyses of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic analytes within the same sample injection event. This integrated technology exhibited superior performance for the proteomics analyses of the total lysate of primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and cynomolgus monkey brain tissue, with enhanced protein and proteome coverage. One of the most comprehensive CGNs proteome to date was characterized: in total, 2201 proteins and 16, 937 unique peptides. This 3 D HILIC-SCX-RP/PGC system allowed the first detailed and simultaneous N-glycomics and N-glycoproteomics analyses of cynomolgus monkey plasma, establishing a glycan library containing 122 proposed N-glycans with confirmed complementary sites of N-glycosylation; 38 N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) –containing N-glycans were also verified through tandem mass spectrometry for the first time. Finally, Chapter 4 describes the first online 2 D PGC-RP LC system with dual sample traps that allowed the implementation of shotgun proteomics and glycomics analyses using less-sophisticated instrumentation. The PGC-platform operated through a mixed mode of mechanisms for peptide separation, taking advantage of both planar contact area–based interactions and hydrophobicity, allowing elimination of the aforementioned RP <b>trap</b> <b>column,</b> mixing loop, and related switching valves for sample loading; thus, this system could be readily assembled on a commercially available MDLC system with minimal modifications. The dual-trap column configuration was adopted, offering desirable high-throughput with almost no idle time for sample fractionation, trapping, or desalting. This 2 D PGC-RP technology performed well, as judged by the results of proteomics and glycoproteomics analyses of cerebellar granule neurons lysates and cynomolgus monkey plasma. A comparison of the HILIC-SCX-RP and PGC-RP analyses in Chapters 2 – 4 revealed that these technologies identified primarily different peptides, consistent with their different mechanisms of separation. Thus, HILIC-SCX-RP and PGC-RP technologies offer a potent combination of protein coverage, efficiency, reproducibility, and sensitivity for large-scale proteomics applications. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
