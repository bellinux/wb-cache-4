Susan Wloszczyna of Indiewire wrote that [...] "Woolverton set a new standard for fully fleshed-out fairy-tale heroines ... with Belle", in turn {{paving the way for}} The Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen, and Frozens Anna and Elsa (2013). Woolverton remains protective of Belle, explaining, [...] " [...] was my first-born child, so there’s a little bit of possessiveness, which really I had to let it go". Beauty and the Beast, Belle performs the film's opening number, [...] "Belle", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992.

To commemorate her work on Beauty and the Beast and various contributions to Disney, O'Hara was honored with a Disney Legends award on August 19, 2011. Disney hired Spanish actress Penélope Cruz to pose as Belle in photographer Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series, while actor Jeff Bridges posed as the Beast.

Bartak later recalled the [...] " [...] displayed all the main features of autism when I met her, including one she wouldn't have known about... The {{fact that she was}} apparently sociable and interacting with people doesn't mean she didn't have some type of disorder". Bartak helped Williams [...] "begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds". In July 1996, doubts about Williams' condition were aired on Radio National's The Health Report and by The Australian newspaper. The claims of [...] "faking it" [...] were denied by both Williams and Bartak. In February 2005, David Smukler, writing in the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities' journal Mental Retardation, noted that back in the mid-1990s some sceptics had a poorly defined understanding of the autism spectrum: [...] "...autistic people such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin started to publish first-person accounts that described their lives as autistic people living in an often-inhospitable nonautistic world. Many readers of these early accounts questioned whether or not the authors were really autistic. The assumption underlying such responses is that autism is so incapacitating that Williams or Grandin could not be autistic and still write with such insight and sensitivity. When their books first appeared, autistic authors were characterized either as frauds or exceptions". Smukler concluded: [...] "Today, Williams' and Grandin's 'credentials' are rarely challenged. Rather than being doubted, they are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> offering us an 'inside out' view of autism".|$|E

60|$|His Latin {{commentary}} on Asiatic poetry is more valuable for the extracts from the Persian and Arabic poets, {{which he has}} brought together in it, than <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> anything else that it contains, or for the style {{in which it is}} written. Certain marks of hurry in the composition, which his old schoolfellow, Doctor Parr, had intimated to him with the ingenuousness of a friend and a scholar, are still apparent. He takes up implicitly with that incomplete and partial, though very ingenious system, which Burke had lately put forth in his essay on the Sublime and Beautiful. He has supported that writer's definition of Beauty by a quotation from Hermogenes. A better confirmation of his theory might have been adduced from the Philebus of Plato, in which Socrates makes the same distinction as our eloquent countryman has taken so much pains to establish between that sensation which accompanies the removal of pain or danger, and which he calls delight--and positive pleasure.[2] As the work, however, of a young man, the commentary was such as justly to raise high expectations of the writer.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{exactly as}} this {{principle}} {{applies to the}} empire, to the nation within the empire, to the city within the nation, to the street within the city, so it applies to the home within the street. The institution of the family is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> precisely the same reasons that {{the institution of the}} nation, or the institution of the city, are in this matter to be commended. It is a good thing for a man to live in a family {{for the same reason that}} it is a good thing for a man to be besieged in a city. It is a good thing for a man to live in a family in the same sense that it is a beautiful and delightful thing for a man to be snowed up in a street. They all force him to realize that life is not a thing from outside, but a thing from inside. Above all, they all insist upon the fact that life, if it be a truly stimulating and fascinating life, is a thing which, of its nature, exists in spite of ourselves. The modern writers who have suggested, in a more or less open manner, that the family is a bad institution, have generally confined themselves to suggesting, with much sharpness, bitterness, or pathos, that perhaps the family is not always very congenial. Of course the family is a good institution because it is uncongenial. It is wholesome precisely because it contains so many divergencies and varieties. It is, as the sentimentalists say, like a little kingdom, and, like most other little kingdoms, is generally in a state of something resembling anarchy. It is exactly because our brother George is not interested in our religious difficulties, but is interested in the Trocadero Restaurant, that the family has some of the bracing qualities of the commonwealth. It is precisely because our uncle Henry does not approve of the theatrical ambitions of our sister Sarah that the family is like humanity. The men and women who, for good reasons and bad, revolt against the family, are, for good reasons and bad, simply revolting against mankind. Aunt Elizabeth is unreasonable, like mankind. Papa is excitable, like mankind Our youngest brother is mischievous, like mankind. Grandpapa is stupid, like the world; he is old, like the world.|$|E

Though she settled with Cirie and Andrea’s group to decimate the other alliance, she later betrayed them to align with Brad and his last remaining ally, Troyzan; the three then used a series of immunities and advantages to secure the majority and reach {{the end of the game}} together. At the Final Tribal Council, Troyzan was overlooked by the jury for being Brad's follower throughout the game, and went on to receive no votes <b>to</b> win. Sarah <b>was</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> her strategic control and social flexibility but criticized for manipulating personal relations for strategic gain, while Brad was lauded for his challenge prowess but condemned for his condescending attitude. Ultimately, the jury awarded Sarah with the title of Sole Survivor with seven votes to Brad’s three.|$|R
60|$|There are six {{things that}} on man's part are the cause he receiveth not {{the gospel of}} Christ, and so life by him--1. They see not their state by nature, how {{polluted}} they are with original sin (Eph 2:2). 2. They see not the justice of God against sin; they know not him that hath said, 'Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense' (Heb 10:30). 3. They cannot see the beauty of Jesus Christ (2 Cor 4:4). 4. Unbelief being mighty in them, they dare not venture their souls with Jesus Christ. They dare not trust to his righteousness, and to that only (Rev 21:8). For, 5. Their carnal reason also sets itself against the word of faith, and cannot stoop to the grace of Jesus Christ (1 Cor 2:14). 6. They love to have honour one of another, they love <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>commended</b> <b>for</b> their own vain-glorious righteousness; and the fools think that because they are commended of men, they shall be commended of God also: 'How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?' (John 5:44). This last thing--to wit, desire of vain-glory, is the bane of thousands; it is the legalist's bane, it is the civilian's[37] bane, it is the formalist's bane, yea, which yet is stranger, it is the bane of the vicious and debauched also;[38] for though there be a generation that, to one's thinking, have not regard to righteousness, yet watch them narrowly, and they have their times of doing {{something that looks like}} good, and though possibly it be but seldom, yet this wretch counteth that, for the sake of that, God accepteth him, and counteth his, glorious righteousness. I might add a seventh cause, which is, want of serious meditation upon eternal judgment, and what shall follow. This consideration, did it take a deep place in the heart, would doubtless produce these workings of spirit after Jesus Christ for justification that now are wanting in the most of men. This made Felix, yea, it makes the devils, tremble; and would, I say, couldst thou deeply meditate, make thee start and turn thy wanton thoughts into heavy sighs after God's mercy in Jesus Christ, lest thou also come into their place of torment.|$|E

Judging from the letters of Congreve, his only writings in prose which it has been my good fortune to meet with, and which, as I remember, contain some admirable remarks on the distinction between wit and humour, I should conclude that one part of his character as a writer has yet to make its way to the public notice. I have heard it observed by a lady, that Johnson, in his Life of Milton, is like a dog incensed and terrified at the presence of some superior creature, at whom he snarls, then runs away, and then returns to snarl again. If the comparison be a just one, it may be added, in extenuation of Johnson's malignity, that he is at least a dog who thinks himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attacking the inveterate foe of his master; for Milton's hostility to a kingly government was the crime which he could not forgive.|$|R
