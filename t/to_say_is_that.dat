500|$|Moran {{apologized for}} the remarks, saying that [...] "I should not have singled out the Jewish {{community}} and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war... What I was trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not think we would be pursuing war as an option." ...|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Spike Lee, in an {{interview}} with Vibe, said he would not see the film, explaining [...] "All I'm going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else." [...] Lee later wrote, [...] "American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them." [...] Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, interpreted the movie as [...] "preparation for race war".|$|E
500|$|Khan {{claimed that}} he was [...] "not surprised" [...] that Taare Zameen Par was not {{included}} in the Academy Award shortlist, and argued, [...] "I don’t make films for awards. I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it. What I am trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> film has been well loved across the globe and that for me it is extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to." ...|$|E

"All that is {{left for}} me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some little doubt may have {{remained}} {{in the minds of}} the Court which will enable the members not to award the extreme penalty. Spare the life of the accused. He has a wife and four children who are dependent upon him for support. Consider also the fact that he is a soldier, and the Court is composed of members of the British Army. I believe I am entitled to appeal to the Court to pronounce a sentence which will enable my client to come out of prison at an early date." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E
500|$|Ian Hyland of News of the World {{disliked the}} episode, stating [...] "After this week's 'Cyberwoman' nonsense, 'Torch Script' {{would be a}} better idea." [...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single nice thing we can find <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the Daily News, traveled to Ireland to cover Boycott's situation. On 24October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had £500 worth of crops that would rot if help {{could not be found}} to harvest them. According to Becker, [...] "Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are sorry, but that they 'dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, but he told Becker that [...] "I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place." [...] Becker's report was reprinted in the Belfast News-Letter and the Dublin Daily Express. On 29October, the Dublin Daily Express published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott's crops. Between them, the Daily Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, and News Letter raised £2,000 to fund the relief expedition.|$|E

2500|$|Series creators Ashley Pharoah and Matthew Graham have {{confirmed}} that they intended Sam's jump to be suicide. In {{an interview with the}} Manchester Evening News, Graham states that Sam is now in the afterlife, where time lasts an eternity compared to the suicide's duration of a few seconds: [...] "The truth is, when I wrote it, what I was trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's died, and that for however long that last second of life is going to be, it will stretch out for an age, as an eternity for him. And so when he drives off in that car, he's really driving off into the afterlife." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I would like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won {{the support of a}} number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E

But the next day, when I went back, I found it had apparently meant nothing; and now, again, that you let me come here and you shine at me like an angel, it doesn't bring you an inch nearer to saying what I want you to say."

6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] Jeanne answered, with a sigh, [...] "that you {{are very}} unintelligent.
