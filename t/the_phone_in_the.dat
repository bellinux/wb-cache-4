5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds {{in a way that}} leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E

25|$|The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in {{the room}} where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to modelling pronunciation variation, particularly for non-native speakers, by modifying <b>the</b> lexicon. <b>In</b> this way we can model several speakers simultaneously, i. e. use the same lexicon and the same acoustic models for all speakers. We use a data-driven approach, i. e. methods {{based solely on the}} reference lexicon, the recognizer’s acoustic models, and the acoustic data. We propose a new alignment procedure using an estimated relation measure between <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference transcription and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alternative transcription of the new speaker data. This measure discovers statistically significant correspondence between <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two transcriptions. We present this measure as association strength. Rules are extracted from the alignment and used to derive pronunciation variants. Following rule pruning based on estimated probability of rules, the most beneficial rules are used to make a common lexicon. Experiments using the new alignment algorithm on the Wall Street Journal non-native speaker database gave pronunciation rules that performed favourably in comparison to other alignment methods. 1...|$|R
