40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the major objectives of the current public policies. Monitoring poverty is twofold : (i) a static component aims at identifying and characterising the various forms of poverty, and (ii) a dynamic component aims, in a comprehensive way, at understanding their evolutions. The multidimensional aspect of poverty, and substitutions occurring among the various dimensions, make the search of the poverty determinants quite difficult. New investigation tools combining quantitative and qualitative approaches are then required to investigate poverty groups over large periods. For this objective, the “observatory” appears to be an appropriate monitoring tool: based on an independent structure collecting permanently information on specific population groups, it produces regular data on the situation and behaviour of these groups, for a set of users. One may distinguish among to types of “observatories”: the “synthetic observatory” gathering diverse information from various sources for a specific <b>thematic</b> <b>objective,</b> and the “field observatory” which, as in the Malagasy case, collects panel data on rural peculiar population. This efficient investigation tool needs, however, methodological input to improve its statistical represensativity and to be kept simple as information requirement is increasing with its functioning.

40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) {{are major}} drivers {{of social and}} {{economic}} change. They are also one of the key Thematic Objectives (TOs) in the European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF). The aim of these funds is to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. ICTs not only constitute an important sector themselves, but are also an important enabler of other sectors. This is why, analysis of ESIF data on planned ICT investments show EUR 12. 2 billion encoded in the dedicated TO, but when ICT categories in other TOs are included, this amount almost doubles, to EUR 21. 4 billion. Finding out more about the ICT investment plans of EU Member States and regions is not always a straightforward process. The available data for ESIF are structured in TOs and Categories of Intervention (CoIs); however, ICT investment often funds activities beyond the dedicated TOs and CoIs. To obtain a better picture of planned ICT investments, the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG CONNECT) and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) have developed an online tool to display planned ICT investment data on a regional basis. This tool will help EC officials, national and regional policymakers working on ICT issues, and beneficiaries of ESIF, to understand what kind of ICT activities are being planned in Europe. The ICT monitoring tool can be searched using a number of predefined filters, or searches of TOs and CoIs can be customised. The tool also contains a database of keywords built up by a semantic search for keywords in Operational Programmes (OPs). This database allows the user to identify OPs that mention a number of ICT activities more frequently than others, and to identify if a specific topic is mentioned in a region at all. The data set included in the tool is based on an in-depth study of individual OPs, as well as on aggregated data sets. When studying the available data, we found that <b>Thematic</b> <b>Objective</b> 2 (TO 2) does not account for all planned ESIF investments in ICT. Using a broader set of CoIs, planned spending on ICT almost doubled, from 3. 8 % to around 6. 6 % of the combined total of European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Funds (CF) and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, it is likely that even this method fails to capture all planned investments, as respondents to our study indicated that substantial investments in ICT will be allocated to other categories, which would increase ESIF investments in ICT to EUR 35. 5 billion. However, this estimate is not currently included in the tool, as the methods of estimating investments are not judged to be adequate. This range of different amounts of investment reflects the dual nature of ICT as an important sector and activity in itself, as well as an enabling technology in other public and private activities. Taking the moderate estimates, the EU Member States that plan by far the largest investments in ICT in absolute terms are Poland, Italy and Spain; the regions with the largest planned investments are Campania (IT), Sicilia (IT), Andalucía (ES), Slaskie (PL) and Puglia (IT). For example, the region of Campania plans to invest more ESIF in ICT than the whole of Germany. The greatest investments will be in broadband and ICT infrastructures (EUR 6. 9 billion), e-Inclusion and digital skills (EUR 3. 9 billion), e-Government (EUR 3. 4 billion), and smart cities and smart grids (EUR 3. 1 billion). To get a more in-depth view of future plans, we carried out a keyword search of ESIF data. Among the most frequently mentioned keywords are ICT innovation, e-Inclusion, broadband and digital content. This is partly because these keywords are broad and all-encompassing, but the findings also reflect the ambition of many regions to invest in ICT-based innovation activities. Quite substantial ICT investments will go to ICT-based innovation and digital content, but this will be listed under CoIs related to support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research and innovation, rather than the core CoIs for planned ICT investments.

40|$|A central {{research}} question addressed by my thesis is “what bridges {{can be built}} to address structural barriers which marginalise the African diaspora from fulfilling universal human rights?” I argue <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives</b> of the International Decade for People of African Descent {{can be linked to}} sustainable development goals (SDGs), e. g. by monitoring border controls for Afri-phobia / Afro-phobia. Achievement of SDG 10, reduce inequality within and among countries, {{is at the core of}} my qualitative research study. Civil society can play a vital role monitoring implementation of Target 10. 3, “ensure equal opportunity (…) by eliminating discriminatory laws (…) and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard” (IAEG-SDGs: 2017). Global Monitoring Indicators 10. 3. 1 and 16. b. 1 monitor “the proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against (…) on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law” (IAEG-SDGs: 2017). The scope of my study relies on the centrality of African experiences, perceptions and understanding as cognitive, structural and functional aspects, for interpreting and creating knowledge for critical evaluation specifically relevant to the African diaspora (Mazama: 2001). With this in mind, I advocate Black Emancipatory Action Research’s theoretical and methodological approach, to researching the Black Mediterranean in Action. My study includes narratives on strategic policy interventions to address Afro-phobia; and desk research on outcomes of the Valletta Summit. Empirical findings of my research study therefore illustrate the relevance of the 2030 Agenda to IDPAD’s <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives,</b> for African migrants and African diaspora communities in Europe, cannot be understated...|$|R

Basically the customary and statutory laws have failed to address challenges associated with water resources management, hence the need to adopt efficient and robust approach to arresting the menace. IWRM referred to a process that promotes the coordination of management and development of land, water and related resources, in order to maximise the social welfare and resultant economic in an equitable way without cooperating the vital ecosystems sustainability (Global Water Partnership 2000). Operationally, IWRM approaches involve application of diverse knowledge from disciplines and insights from stakeholders to devise and implement equitable, efficient and sustainable solutions and development problems of water (GWP 2000).

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} highlights {{historical and}} contemporary manifestations of Afro-phobia hinder the implementation of anti-discrimination norms. Black, African, African diaspora and people of African descent are used here to refer to “descendants of enslaved Africans (…) African migrants and their descendants” as illustrated by (Nwabuzo: 2015). I argue <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives</b> of the International Decade for People of African Descent {{can be linked to}} achievement of sustainable development goals for more successful outcomes. Notably critical evaluation of the achievement of SDG 10, i. e. to reduce inequality within and among countries, {{is at the core of}} my qualitative research study. Target 10. 2 is one of two targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which specifically mentions racial or ethnic origin (IAEG-SDGs: 2017). However, the potential for flawed data collection remains despite full disaggregation of equality data is advocated by UN GA Res. 68 / 261. I aim to critically evaluate norm implementation illustrating: state parties’ interpretation of racial or ethnic origin: collaborations for strategic policy interventions to address Afro-phobia in Europe. The scope of this study relies on the centrality of African experiences, perceptions and understanding as cognitive, structural and functional aspects for interpreting and creating new knowledge. My research tactics therefore include African narratives on policymaking initiatives at the supranational, regional, national and local levels; e. g. strategic interventions to address Afro-phobia in the European Parliament. My thesis therefore raises awareness of links between IDPAD and the 2030 Agenda: e. g. some European countries do not collect disaggregated equality data; people of African descent remain “invisible” in statistical analyses despite being marginalised in our access to human rights. In summary, empirical findings of my qualitative research study illustrate the relevance of SDG targets and indicators to IDPAD’s <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives</b> of recognition, justice and development. These links are useful for promoting universal human rights and the principle of equality: for an inclusive holistic approach to the 2030 Agenda which strategically address Afro-phobia...|$|R

Based on a review of the FP research and commissioning structures, at least three levels of objectives can be identified as relevant to many of the transport research projects commissioned under past two Framework Programmes. These are: (1) FP Work Programme-level (WP) objectives; (2) Work Programme sub-level (<b>thematic)</b> <b>objectives</b> (that the project was commissioned under); (3) Project-level objectives. The evaluation matrix enables evaluators to specify whether each of the above objectives have been met fully, partially, indirectly or not at all. The same approach is applied to evaluate the potential impacts of research projects in four impact groups and with related indicators (see Table  1). In addition, each completed evaluation needs to be accompanied by a textual summary. The summary supplements the evaluation matrix by detailing other relevant and specific information about projects and/or their outcomes. The research objectives on different levels and impact indicators form the basis of the evaluation matrices. The evaluation matrices are completed basing on the published Final Reports of projects.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} 30 years, {{the notion of}} {{landscape}} has emerged in ecology {{as a result of}} both theoretical considerations and practical aspects of land use and land cover. This has generated a variety of numerical models addressing both methodological and <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives.</b> Scientists model landscapes for at least two reasons: to better understand the landscape dynamics themselves (called intrinsic needs) and to offer a realistic frame to support other ecological processes (extrinsic needs). This paper mainly concerns the intrinsic needs; it reviews and discusses the way the socioeconomic and/or ecological mechanisms of various landscapes have been explored through modelling approaches in the past. Our objective is to identify the possible lack of understanding in landscape dynamics and to propose a unified view of this complex object. We outline the links between the concepts of landscape and of models using a double-entry matrix, focusing on one hand on the four main terrestrial landscapes (agricultural, forested, arid and urban) {{and on the other hand}} on the main landscape model characteristics (explicit or neutral, patchy or continuous, and multi-or mono-scale). The patterns and processes of each of the four landscape types, in particular, are analysed within a coherent framework. The heterogeneity of this yet coherent analytical matrix implies the need for unifying concepts and formalisms. The complexity theory and related concepts such as self-organization or formal grammar applied to landscape mosaics could help to further develop the mathematical formalisms necessary to assemble the various inner landscape processes. The discipline can now offer a theoretical dimension to dynamic landscape modelling aiming at understanding the mechanism unity underlying this complex object...|$|R

More, mountain area is considerate a natural-economic region and constitutes an important objective for regional development policy. The main sectors of mountain area are presented in agriculture and tourism fields that lead the key role in safeguarding the sensitive eco-system and thereby maintaining the general living and working space. Mountain areas should have a specific policy defined by the sustainable development principle, which {{meets the needs of}} the present without compromising the opportunities of future generations. The specific mountain policy aims to reduce the imbalance between favored and disadvantaged mountain regions, permanently marked by natural, economic, social, cultural and environmental constraints. In previous programming period, mountain regions among have profited from the intensive regional support, in specially, for constructing of and connecting them to fresh water and waste water networks, in particular for increasing of life quality. In context of 2020 Strategy, the Member States will concentrate investments on a small number of <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives.</b> In advanced regions, 60 % of funds will used for only two of these objectives (competitiveness of SME and research/innovation).

Saving ecosystems through the conservation of non-renewable energy sources and the preservation of natural habitats is of primary importance, as well. According to the EU budget for 2014 - 2020 the cohesion policy invests 325 billion euros in member states {{in order to be able}} to accomplish the aims related to growth and the creation of workplaces and deal with the challenges of climate change, energy dependency and social exclusion. The smart, sustainable and inclusive growth should be highlighted from the strategic objectives of cohesion policy and the 11 <b>thematic</b> <b>objectives,</b> the accomplishment of which is compulsory for all the member states. The template requirement of the implementation of EU goals makes it difficult to enforce national aims and their representation in development plans. Another problem is that among the goals there are no specifically regional ones. The most important regulatory changes in the new budget cycle refer to the reduction of utilizable funds, strengthening resource and thematic concentration, stricter measurement of results, and making it more difficult to access funds. The system of aims of the Széchenyi 2020 development plan is adjusted to the regulations following the value aims of Europe 2020 strategy and formulates sustainable, high added value production, expansion of employment and national aims promoting economic growth.

The data were integrated into GIS to get a 1986 's, a 1997 's, a 1999 's and a 2000 's land use map, to generate a chronological view of the urban evaluation. The district that were analysed cover 90 km 2, and there area about 45. 000 inhabitants. (IBGE, 2000). In 1995, the urban perimeter of these districts were considerably expanded to the North, up to a previously agriculture area with some industry. The results obtained showed that the use of the GIS-SPRING/INPE and digital orbital images in the generation and integration of data files is reasonable enough, compared to conventional procedures to elaborate land use maps {{and to be able to}} make comparative evaluations.

40|$|Objective: Few studies {{systematically}} explore {{elements of}} successful project implementation across {{a range of}} alcohol and other drug (AOD) activities. This paper provides an evidence base to inform project implementation in the AOD field. Approach: We accessed records for 127 completed projects funded by the Alcohol, Education and Rehabilitation Foundation from 2002 to 2008. An adapted realist synthesis methodology enabled us to develop categories of enablers and barriers to successful project implementation, and to identify factors statistically associated with successful project implementation, defined as meeting all funding <b>objectives.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis of eight case study projects allowed detailed exploration of findings. Results: Nine enabler and 10 barrier categories were identified. Those most frequently reported as both barriers and enablers concerned partnerships with external agencies and communities, staffing and project design. Conclusion: Achieving supportive relationships with partner agencies and communities, employing skilled staff and implementing consumer or participant input mechanisms were statistically associated with successful project implementation. Implications: The framework described here will support development of evidence-based project funding guidelines and project performance indicators. The study provides evidence that investing project hours and resources to develop robust relationships with project partners and communities, implementing mechanisms for consumer or participant input and attracting skilled staff are legitimate and important activities, not just in themselves but because they potentially influence achievement of project funding objectives...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{tendencies in}} the {{contemporary}} education and the requirement to respect the holistic approach in the pedagogical work with children, one of the requirements established {{in front of the}} teacher refers to the possibilities to establish integration - correlation relationships between the educational contents from different teaching subjects in primary education. In this regard, we take the physical and health education curriculum as a starting point considering its overall aim - the influence toward development of complete personality as well as the connection between the motor development and other segments of development in children. Based on this, the aim {{of this paper is to}} establish integration-correlated connections between the curricula subject physical and health education, and other subjects, as the Macedonian language and literature, Mathematics, Arts, Music education, Science and Society, learned in third grade in primary nine year compulsory education. The theoretic analyses of the curricula for third grade was realized. The analyses included comparison on following items: the representation of the subject, goals and <b>objectives,</b> <b>thematic</b> units, the specific content based on these possibilities and examples for correlation and integrative approach. The general conclusion is that many correlations and integrative relations could be established between the PE contents and the contents from other teaching subjects. This from one side will produce emphasized mental, and on the other side, physical load. The forms of realization of these relations are different and depends mainly on the teachers’ creativity and preparedness to work on this goal...|$|R
40|$|Dear Colleague, In 2016, the International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology has {{awarded the}} two best {{systematic}} and/or literature reviews published in our journal in 2015, seeking to highlight articles that form the foundations and concepts of universal knowledge. We believe this serves to identify, evaluate, and interpret all available and relevant studies for a specific <b>thematic</b> issue. The <b>objective</b> is to review {{the state of the}} art, confronting the existing evidence on a given subject, and thus seeking new lines of research. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses used globally by the medical community allow us to ensure that we have as precise a summary as possible, of all the trials that took place on a particular medical science topic. With this effort, we wish to appreciate and honor awarded authors, encouraging new talents in international otorhinolaryngological research with a commitment to stimulate education and technological development through research and training. The studies that stood out were the following: 1.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} grammar curriculum in English language textbooks. It {{looks into the}} order of presented grammatical structures and their thematic context. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts a theoretical and an empirical one. Emphasis is given on the empirical part. The theoretical part includes definitions of basic terms associated with grammar curriculum in English langugae textbooks. Particular attention is paid to the notion of grammar, its functions in language learning and to its relation to other staples of language learning as well as to approaches and methods of teaching foreign languages. The second half of the theoretical part focuses on textbooks, their functions, structural components, language level, language and <b>thematic</b> content. The <b>objective</b> of the empirical part is to present our research on grammar curricula of selected English language textbooks for elementary schools. The heart of the empirical part comprises an in-depth analysis and comparative study of the order and thematic context of presented grammatical structures. The aim of this analysis and comparison is to verify whether it is possible to find a similar range of grammatical structures which are presented in similar order in all the textbooks concerned. The aim is also to find out whether it is possible to find typical connections of grammar structures and thematic contexts in which the structures are presented witch focus on differences which may appear in grammar curricula of English language textbooks written by Czech authors and those written by foreign authors. Key words: grammar curriculum, order of grammatical structures, thematic context, English language textbook...|$|R
