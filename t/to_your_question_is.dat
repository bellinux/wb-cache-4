In March, [...] "the St Petersburg legislator Milonov who had become {{a spokesman for the}} law ‘homosexual propaganda' towards children started mentioning me and my ‘perverted family’ in his interviews," [...] and Gessen contacted an adoption lawyer asking [...] "whether I had reason to worry that social services would go after my family and attempt to remove my oldest son, whom I adopted in 2000." [...] The lawyer told Gessen [...] "to instruct my son to run if he is approached by strangers and concluding: ‘The answer <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> at the airport.’" [...] In June 2013, Gessen was beaten up outside of the Parliament [...] "and I realised that in all my interactions, including professional ones, I no longer felt I was perceived as a journalist first: I am now a person with a pink triangle." [...] She stated that [...] "a court would easily decide to annul Vova's adoption, and I wouldn't even know it." [...] Given this potential threat to her family, Gessen [...] "felt like no risk was small enough to be acceptable," [...] she later told the CBC. [...] "So we just had to get out." [...] In a January 2014 interview with ABC News, Gessen said that the Russian gay propaganda law had [...] "led to a huge increase in antigay violence, including murders. It's led to attacks on gay and lesbian clubs and film festivals...and because these laws are passed supposedly to protect children, the people who are most targeted or have the most to fear are LGBT parents." ...|$|E

After elaborate and tedious number crunching, the computer returns: "The answer <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 42 ". It is obvious, that the monetary valuation of road safety is not an easy task either. In fact, it implies answering an equally difficult and intriguing question – What is the statistical value of a human life? Although various methods and approaches have been put forward to estimate the statistical cost of a road fatality, some scholars argue that valuing fatal injuries and hence human life is virtually impossible. They maintain that people do not nearly have sufficiently accurate preferences to make a sensible trade-off between road safety and money. The (perceptions of) changes in risk levels are so small that making the trade-off is very difficult, if not impossible (Hauer, 1994). However, other road safety costs can be statistically determined and initiatives developed to reduce the burden to both organisations and individuals. Therefore, the topic {{of this paper is to}} determine what factors contribute to work-related road incidents and how economic costs to industry organisations could be reduced...|$|E

60|$|Montesinos.--Not so, Sir Thomas. Impossible {{as it may}} be for us to {{reconcile}} the free will of man with the foreknowledge of God, I nevertheless believe in both with the most full conviction. When the human mind plunges into time and space in its speculations, it adventures beyond its sphere; no wonder, therefore, that its powers fail, and it is lost. But that my will is free, I know feelingly: it is proved to me by my conscience. And that God provideth all things I know by His own Word, and by that instinct which He hath implanted in me to assure me of His being. My answer <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question,</b> then, <b>is</b> this: I believe that the happy consummation which I desire is appointed, and must come to pass; but that when it is to come depends upon the obedience of man to the will of God, that is, upon human actions.|$|R

I was tempted to improvise a reply to the question regarding food for the imagination in this country. It is what it is in any country: reality. It is true that reality over here is different from the reality to which you are accustomed. It is also true that it not only changes from place to place, but {{from time to time and}} that in every place and at every time the imagination makes its way by reason of it. This is a simple and unrhetorical answer <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question.</b> A man <b>is</b> not bothered by the reality to which he is accustomed, that is to say, in the midst of which he has been born. He may be very much disturbed by reality elsewhere, but even as to that it would <b>be</b> only a <b>question</b> of time.

Their "hibernation" occurs in the summer and "blooming" in the winter. To resist the phenomenon of drought the human being finds spaces in the cosmology. He creates the cosmography by describing everything about him and gives meaning to life making these elements from the myths, legends and rites enriching them a vast symbolism, because the human being always will always be a social semiotic. Through sign search direction for the various relationships and situations that surround them. According to R Jakoson, the man identifies himself with the environment and the social environment for these give meaning to “Himself” that was lost in the whole of cosmic nature. The range of meanings given to the elements by the inhabitants of the countryside is the answer that {{even in the midst of}} modern situations has a culture and thought itself and constituted by particular climate and vegetation, and the creation of these two phenomenon are part of the constitution and characterization of these people, and makes creative beings and in this picture comes and goes in the nature of thoughts seeking the answers <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>questions.</b> This <b>is</b> how the prophets of rain are forecast winter of each year in this region, January-May, through codes, symbols that are being inter-related with myths and interspersed with rituals. The secret of all this are the “Retornos” that give meaning to the answers deciphered through signs. "When I was a little woman I spent all the night watching the lightning" (Chico Leiteiro from Quixadá-CE). The signals used are the elements that respond the needs that are ignored by those who have no link with the hinterland. Even before the modern mythology that fascinate and involve a lot of the youth, traditional cultures try to find ways to resist. His influence still pervades with enough force amid the traditional hinterland communities that remain faithful to its forecast of winter through the bar Christmas (winter solstice) the path of St. James (milk-way), Southern Cross, among other signs cosmological, which are deciphered by the sensitivity that these communities are in relationship with the biosphere and the stars...|$|R
