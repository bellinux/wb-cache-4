5|$|According to the Donnison Report (discussed in {{the next}} section), <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> of four types, though the {{boundaries}} between them were not always clear-cut.|$|E
5|$|Before Culford School became coeducational in 1972, all but 2 of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> single sex, with {{a slight}} {{majority}} of girls' schools.|$|E
5|$|Around twenty {{schools were}} opened {{during the late}} 19th century, {{although}} many {{had only a few}} pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> {{known for}} its strict haircut rules for boys. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> {{affiliated}} to SSC Board.

5000|$|In 1913 {{the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> changed from Lawrence Asylum to Maj Gen Sir Henry Lawrence Memorial School. On being accorded royal {{patronage}} in 1922 {{the name of}} <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> changed in 1925 to the Lawrence Memorial Royal Military School. Soon after India's independence, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> {{handed over to the}} civilian authorities of the Government of India in 1949; subsequently the name of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> changed to <b>The</b> Lawrence <b>School,</b> as it <b>is</b> known today. As <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> located in Lovedale, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> also simply referred to as [...] "Lovedale".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1956 as Temple Moor Grammar School, a status it {{retained}} until 1973. At its inception, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> male-only. This approach was abandoned as times changed, and <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> currently a mixed gender institution (1992). <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> associated with notable local families, most credibly the DeLacy family, who are {{recognised in the}} Temple Newsam area.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1847 {{and lasting}} until 1996, the Canadian government, in {{partnership}} with the Catholic Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were forcibly taken from their homes. While <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> said to educate, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> in {{the north}} of England, with 46 in the {{historic}} county of Lancashire (including Manchester) and 18 in the West Riding of Yorkshire, while there were only 7 in inner London and 4 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> {{first called}} Porthall National <b>School</b> and <b>was</b> opened in 1836 {{by way of}} a free lease granted in 1825 by a local {{landlord}} called Mr. Dougherty from Redcastle and the local Land agent Mr. Clarke. The first teacher at <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> a Patrick Conway who earned £4, 0s, ½p per year. Trustees of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>were</b> Mr. C.B. Hamilton and Mr. John McColgan. In 1886 <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> renamed Boyagh National <b>School.</b> <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> taken over by the Irish Department of Education in 1934. Today Scoil Bhríde consists of two multi-grade classrooms. In 2011 <b>the</b> <b>school</b> attendance <b>was</b> thirty-five pupils. Various subjects taught in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> include Irish, English, Maths and Drama. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>is</b> a mainstream primary <b>school</b> under <b>the</b> patronage of the Catholic Bishop of Derry.|$|R
6000|$|The {{discipline}} at Christ's Hospital in my {{time was}} ultra-Spartan;--all domestic ties were to be put aside. [...] "Boy!"

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1960 by Saint Patrick Parish as Saint Patrick Convent <b>School.</b> <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> staffed by Sisters of Mercy from nearby Windham for many years; however, more lay {{teachers}} were gradually employed, {{and in the}} early 1990s <b>the</b> <b>school's</b> name <b>was</b> officially changed to Saint Patrick <b>School.</b> At <b>the</b> time of its closing, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> staffed entirely by state-certified lay personnel. In August 2015 <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> closed due to lack of enrollment for <b>the</b> upcoming <b>school</b> year.|$|R
5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, as {{thousands}} {{of members of the}} church traveled to the Holy Supper celebration in Guadalajara, several members of a neighboring community supported by Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez protested the use of schools to provide temporary shelters for the Luz del Mundo pilgrims. The protesters said that after the ceremony <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> left in disarray; however church authorities presented photographic evidence to newspapers to refute these claims.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the colony's ethnic Chinese {{population}} was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or natives. Aged ten, Lie {{was enrolled in a}} Calvinist missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity– <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> meant to promote Christianity in the Dutch East Indies, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most students, did not convert, although biographer Tio Ie Soei writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his world view.|$|E
50|$|Horton’s {{quest to}} create and {{maintain}} <b>the</b> Highlander <b>School</b> <b>was</b> opposed by Southern law enforcement. In 1959, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> accused of violating segregation and selling alcohol. Adults at <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>were</b> allowed to leave coins when they took beer {{out of the refrigerator}} at <b>the</b> <b>school.</b> <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>was</b> convicted and shut down. Horton immediately applied for a new charter and reopened <b>the</b> <b>school</b> (Highlander School 2).|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 19th century, all {{education}} in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills {{as well as}} social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.|$|E
5|$|Although {{expected}} {{to accommodate the}} needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> expanded to accommodate 9,000 students, and a 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues resonated more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.|$|E
5|$|His {{concern with}} public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave {{it back to the}} XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid out a series of instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital costs associated with <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed {{to reach an agreement}} with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{system had}} {{its origins in}} laws enacted before Confederation, but was {{primarily}} active from {{the passage of the}} Indian Act in 1876. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1884 made attendance at day schools, industrial schools, or residential schools compulsory for First Nations children. Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant that for some families residential schools were the only way to comply. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize Indigenous children. Parental visits were further restricted by the use of a pass system designed to confine Indigenous peoples to reserves. The last federally operated residential school closed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|When Saladin {{restored}} Sunni orthodoxy in Egypt, 10 madrasas {{were established}} during his reign, {{and an additional}} 25 during the entire Ayyubid period of rule. Each of their locations had religious, political, and economic significance, in particular those in al-Fustat. Most of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> dedicated to the Shafi'i denomination, but others belonged to the Maliki and Hanafi madhabs. The madrasas built near the tomb of Imam al-Shafi'i were located adjacent to the important centers of pilgrimage and were {{a major focus of}} Sunni devotion. About 26 schools were built in Egypt, Jerusalem and Damascus by high-ranking government officials, and unusual for the time, commoners also founded in Egypt about 18 schools, including two medical institutions.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>were</b> required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E
