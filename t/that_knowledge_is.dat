25|$|In {{several of}} Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates the idea <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> {{a matter of}} recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study. He {{maintains}} this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often found arguing <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> not empirical, and that it comes from divine insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the Phaedo, Republic and Phaedrus Plato advocates {{a belief in the}} immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the afterlife. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and reality, nature and custom, and body and soul.|$|E
25|$|Another {{divergence}} from Samkhya is {{that while}} the Samkhya holds <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> the means to liberation, Patañjali's Yoga insists on the methods of concentration and active striving. The aim of Yoga is to free the individual from the clutches of matter, and considers intellectual knowledge alone to be inadequate for the purpose– which is different from the position taken by Samkhya.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{claimed the}} death of God would {{eventually}} lead {{to the loss of}} any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of objective truth. Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> contingent and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests. This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. This view has acquired the name perspectivism.|$|E
5000|$|Boiko implied <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> both open to {{rational}} {{discourse and}} justification, when he defined knowledge as [...] "a matter of dispute".|$|R
6000|$|... "We will spare your {{knowledge}} at present, captain, and save your modesty {{at the same}} time the trouble of telling us how <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> acquired," [...] answered Lord Dalgarno, rather contemptuously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Again and yet again, {{until the}} time comes for us to leave the earth for ever. Of this, indeed, I <b>am</b> sure, for <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> part of the secret wisdom of my people." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{his book}} Scepticism and Animal Faith he asserts <b>that</b> <b>{{knowledge}}</b> <b>is</b> {{not the result}} of reasoning. Instead, knowledge is what is required in order to act and successfully engage with the world. As a naturalist, Santayana was a harsh critic of epistemological foundationalism. The explanation of events in the natural world is within the realm of science, while the meaning and value of this action should be studied by philosophers. Santayana was accompanied in the intellectual climate of 'common sense' philosophy by the thinkers of the New Realism movement, such as Ralph Barton Perry.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu texts offer a {{conflicting}} view {{of whether}} access to guru and education {{was limited to}} men and to certain varna (castes). The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or on varna. The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are guru and participated in vedic studies. The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters.|$|E
25|$|Schleiermacher's {{doctrine}} of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of Kant <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> bounded by experience, but {{it seeks to}} remove Kant's scepticism as to knowledge of the ding an sich (the noumenon) or Sein, as Schleiermacher's term is. The idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being. All knowledge {{takes the form of}} the concept (Begriff) or the judgment (Urteil), the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality, and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects.|$|E
50|$|Carneades {{is known}} as an Academic skeptic. Academic skeptics (so called because this {{was the type of}} {{skepticism}} taught in Plato's Academy in Athens) hold <b>that</b> all <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> impossible, except for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> all other <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> impossible.|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} midseventies, {{researchers}} have recognized <b>that</b> capturing <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> {{the key to}} building large and powerful AI systems. In the years since, we have also found <b>that</b> representing <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> difficult and time consuming. Although we have developed tools to help with knowledge acquisition...|$|R
6000|$|Irritated as he was, Renshaw {{could not}} avoid the {{reflection}} {{that the old}} man was right. What, indeed, could he say to her with his present imperfect knowledge? How could she write to him if <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> correct? ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{different}} {{schools of thought}} in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories {{are the result of}} generalizations from such observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.|$|E
25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E
25|$|Empiricism {{has stood}} in {{contrast}} to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> created by the human intellect, not by observation. Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation {{is made in the}} light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error. It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be {{effective}} and successful in the solving of problems collaboratively, it <b>is</b> crucial <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>be</b> continuously shared and constructed in teams. In practice, while team members search, collect, and share resources relevant to their problem solving, they construct <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> shared between them. In successful collaboration, the team members echo and engage in the ideas of others by adding to each other’s ideas rather than ignoring or rejecting many contributions.|$|R
6000|$|But {{is it true}} {{that the}} {{acquisition}} of such a knowledge of science as is proposed, and the communication of <b>that</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>are</b> calculated to weaken your usefulness? Or may I not rather ask, is it possible for you to discharge your functions properly without these aids? ...|$|R

25|$|Hari Raya Saraswati is {{dedicated}} {{the goddess of}} learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> an essential medium to achieve the goal {{of life as a}} human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, Brahma, who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, Shatarupa. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar (palm-leaf manuscripts), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks the start of the new year according to the Balinese Pawukon calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.|$|E
500|$|Euler and {{his friend}} Daniel Bernoulli were opponents of Leibniz's monadism and the {{philosophy}} of Christian Wolff. Euler insisted <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> founded {{in part on the}} basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he {{went so far as to}} label Wolff's ideas as [...] "heathen and atheistic".|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{anywhere}} in ancient Indian thought we {{are permitted to}} see the real anticipation of the view <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> power – which, when further worked out, assumes the formulation that freedom is the recognition of necessity – {{it is to be}} found among the practitioners of the healing art".|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "tacit knowing" [...] or [...] "tacit knowledge" [...] is {{attributed}} to Michael Polanyi in 1958 in Personal Knowledge. In his later work The Tacit Dimension he made the assertion that [...] "we can know {{more than we can}} tell." [...] He states not only <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> cannot <b>be</b> adequately articulated by verbal means, but also <b>that</b> all <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> rooted in tacit knowledge.|$|R
5000|$|For the Academic Skeptics acatalepsy meant <b>that</b> human <b>knowledge</b> never {{amounts to}} certainty, {{but only to}} probability. For the Pyrrhonists it meant <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> limited to the {{appearances}} (phantasiai) and the pathē. The Pyrrhonists attempted to show, while Academic skeptics asserted an absolute acatalepsia; all human science or knowledge, according to them, went no further than to appearances and verisimilitude.|$|R
2500|$|A major {{subject of}} concern and {{controversy}} {{in the philosophy of}} science has been the nature of theory change in science. Karl Popper argued <b>that</b> scientific <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> progressive and cumulative; Thomas Kuhn, <b>that</b> scientific <b>knowledge</b> moves through [...] "paradigm shifts" [...] and is not necessarily progressive; and Paul Feyerabend, <b>that</b> scientific <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> not cumulative or progressive and {{that there can be no}} demarcation in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.|$|R
2500|$|Social constructivism, {{strongly}} influenced by Vygotsky's (1978) work, suggests <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> first constructed in a social context and is then appropriated by individuals (Bruning et al., 1999; M. Cole, 1991; Eggan & Kauchak, 2004). [...] According to social constructivists, the process of sharing individual perspectives-called collaborative elaboration (Meter & Stevens, 2000)-results in learners constructing understanding together that wouldn't be possible alone (Greeno et al., 1996).|$|E
2500|$|John Locke {{followed}} by taking issue with Plato's theory of innate learning processes. In place of this theory, he {{introduced a new}} theory of learning based on the term [...] "tabula rasa," [...] which means [...] "blank slate." [...] Locke explained that learning took place primarily through experience, {{and we were all}} born without knowledge. This doctrine is known as [...] "empiricism," [...] the view <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> primarily [...] built on learning and experience.|$|E
2500|$|Avicenna's most {{influential}} theory in epistemology is {{his theory of}} knowledge, in which he developed the concept of tabula rasa. He argued that the [...] "human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> attained through [...] "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" [...] which is developed through a [...] "syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts." ...|$|E
50|$|However, still a {{dominant}} sector of society thinks <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> should <b>be</b> protected by several legal regimes {{commonly referred to}} with the term 'intellectual property'. This term suggests <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> can <b>be</b> exclusively owned and neglects the differences between tangible and intangible goods: while tangible goods have a scarcity problem, intangible goods can be copied and shared without limit and, when shared, tend to increase their total value.|$|R
5000|$|Most moral epistemologies, of course, posit <b>that</b> moral <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> somehow possible, {{as opposed}} to moral skepticism.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} a report of an {{investigation}} of the current state of knowledge management implementation in three South African financial organisations. Two data collection methods were used, namely a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews with senior representatives of the organisations. Although some of the respondents felt <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> management <b>is</b> another fad, the majority of the respondents indicated <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> management <b>is</b> a major strategic imperative for staying competitive. They also regard their organisations as knowledge-based businesses. Three-quarters of the respondents reported that the most compelling reason for investing in <b>knowledge</b> management <b>was</b> increased value for customers. Although various barriers to <b>knowledge</b> management <b>were</b> identified, the results of the case studies indicated <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> management <b>was</b> seen as a new way to expose tacit knowledge, as well as a more effective way of creating and organising corporate knowledge...|$|R
2500|$|Ernst von Glasersfeld was a {{prominent}} proponent of radical constructivism. This claims <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, {{it is up to}} the individual to [...] "link up" [...] specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what [...] "actually" [...] occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but [...] "circularly conjoined".|$|E

His [...] love of history is reflected in his considerable knowledge of military history, but in particular the American Civil War, where <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> considered to be extensive.

2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno {{for his own}} thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests {{that they have made}} a mistake in agreeing <b>that</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.|$|E
