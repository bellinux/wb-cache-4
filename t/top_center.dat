25|$|In February 2004, Incognito was {{involved}} in a fight at a party and was charged with three counts of assault.

25|$|Anti-tank guided weapons (ATGMs) can be {{operated}} by the BMD-3. This is {{made possible by the}} 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided Fagot (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The 9P135M launcher is located on the <b>top</b> <b>center</b> of the BMD-3 turret and is dismountable. The crew can engage targets from the vehicle or a distance away from the system. The ATGM launcher has three ready-to-use rounds and two stowed in the vehicle. The Fagot missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2km. While flying at an average speed of 186m/s, it penetrates 480mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5km and a penetration of 550mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750–800mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750–800mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. A French-German Flame-V adapter kit allows the BMD-3 to launch MILAN ATGMs.|$|E
25|$|In the Book of Cerne the illuminations of {{the four}} evangelists precede each Gospel section {{containing}} the selected extracts from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These miniatures are found on the verso (v) sides of folios 2 (Matthew), 12 (Mark), 21 (Luke), and 31 (John). All four illuminations are consistent using the same format, but with nuanced variations that help to visually discern and introduce each Gospel section. The miniatures exhibit a more linear figural style. In the <b>top</b> <b>center</b> set within a circular medallion or roundel is a partial frontal human bust of the Evangelist who is beardless and has a halo or nimbus. He holds his Gospel book in his left hand, while the right hand is variable in each image. This medallion {{is located at the}} apex of an arched frame that is supported by two verticals or columns with capitals. These rest on or without a base on a bottom horizontal floor. Each set of capitals in these illuminations is different from each other. Set within the arch is a full-length figure is the particular tetramorph beast symbol of each particular Evangelist – Human/Angel (Matthew), Lion (Mark), Ox/Calf (Luke), and Eagle (John) – inspired by the vision found in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel 1.10. All four evangelical beast symbols are all winged and haloed or nimbed, and each beast symbol holds a book in its fore or hind limbs. Each miniature is also accompanied by a set of two Latin inscriptions written in capital letters, one at the top flanking the human bust and the other at the bottom flanking the beast symbol.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure. They finished 42–40, and missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heart beat. Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a <b>top</b> <b>center,</b> and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation. He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning. Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused of him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation. His agent cited his differences with the organization as being [...] "irreconcilable", and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office. With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle said that Olajuwon being dealt was [...] "as close to a sure thing as there is." ...|$|E
