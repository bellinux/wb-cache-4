5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to <b>the</b> <b>external</b> {{anatomy of}} the clitoris– glans, hood and <b>the</b> <b>external</b> shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E

5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always ensures that <b>the</b> <b>external</b> sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle {{before any of}} the four connectors within make electrical contact. <b>The</b> <b>external</b> metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E

40|$|Edited by Alexei Baranov, Eric TournieIn this chapter, we {{will review}} recent {{advances}} and trends in phase locking of broad-area laser diode arrays. In particular, we {{will concentrate on}} coherent phase locking of high-power, broad-area diode arrays in a passive external cavity. We will present a newly designed <b>external</b> cavity called <b>the</b> V-shape <b>external</b> Talbot cavity. <b>The</b> V-shape <b>external</b> cavity is capable of selecting single transverse mode operation of individual laser diodes on an array and providing optical coupling among laser diodes. The high visibility far-field interference pattern confirms that phase locking is achieved among laser diodes on an array. Two experimental schematic designs of <b>the</b> V-shape <b>external</b> Talbot cavity are explored. One is <b>the</b> V-shape <b>external</b> Talbot cavity, {{and the other is}} <b>the</b> closed V-shape <b>external</b> Talbot cavity. <b>The</b> differences in <b>external</b> cavity design and performance will be discussed.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>external</b> {{morphology}} of Lepidoptera is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on <b>the</b> <b>external</b> parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
