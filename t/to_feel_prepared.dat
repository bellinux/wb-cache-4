5000|$|Throughout {{the post-war}} period, a tailored, {{feminine}} look was prized and accessories such as gloves and pearls were popular. Tailored suits had fitted jackets with peplums, usually worn with a long, narrow pencil skirt. Day dresses had fitted bodices and full skirts, with jewel or low-cut necklines or Peter Pan collars. Shirtdresses, with a shirt-like bodice, were popular, as were halter-top sundresses. Skirts were narrow or very full, held out with petticoats; poodle skirts were a brief fad. Ball gowns (full-skirted gown for white tie occasions) were longer than ankle-length dresses (called [...] "ballerina length"), reaching {{the floor and}} worn to balls (as they are today). Cocktail dresses, [...] "smarter than a day dress but not as formal as a dinner or evening dress" [...] were worn for early-evening parties. Short shrugs and bolero jackets, often made to match low-cut dresses, were worn. Meanwhile, in Israel, simple Biblical sandals, blue cotton shirts and utilitarian, khaki military inspired dress remained popular choices for many women due to ongoing economic austerity and the need <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for war.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{document}} the process through which a team of athletes and coaches felt and attempted to learn and apply resonance in a group context throughout a season. Resonance is a process that allows people to identify how they want <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>to</b> experience that desired 'feel,' recognize obstacles that prevent them from feeling the way they want, and reconnecting when they are disengaged (Newburg, 2006; Newburg et al., 2002). Sixteen synchronized swimmers, one head coach, and one assistant coach participated in a group resonance based intervention over the span of a four month competitive season. The results, which are presented as two narratives, suggest that a group resonance process is possible. However, participants must be prepared to take ownership of this process and engage in challenging, deliberate work to incorporate their individual desired feel and the desired feel of others in the everyday experiences of a competitive team. This story also indicates that unresolved conflict can be detrimental to (a) relationships between athletes and coach, (b) performance, and (c) how people want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> in the context of their sport...|$|R

40|$|A. Taylor Kelley 1 and James B. Layton 1 Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify whether nurses are as likely as physicians <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to assist patients to quit smoking, to have smoked in front of patients, or to have received training on counseling patients about smok-ing cessation. The sample consisted of 262 nurses and 251 physicians, ages 18 years and older, from public and private hos-pitals in Jordan. It was found that nurses were more likely than physicians to receive training on counseling patients about smoking cessation (41 % vs. 18 %); more likely to currently smoke (30 % vs. 19 %); and less likely <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to assist patients to quit smoking (78 % vs. 95 %). Smoking status and training were associated with counseling patients about smok-ing. Approximately 19 % of nurses and 81 % of physicians who currently or formerly smoked had previously smoked in front of patients. Nurses compared with physicians have lower agreement with statements involving smoking-related responsibilities and views on smoking policy, but higher agreement that second-hand smoke is related to selected diseases. Physicians felt more strongly than nurses that they should serve as role models for the public, routinely advise their smoking patients to quit, and speak to lay groups about smoking. In conclusion, a greater level of smoking cessation training among physicians and nurses in Jordan is warranted.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{identified}} problems with undergraduate oncology teaching. We have investigated how well prepared newly qualified doctors (first foundation year, or FY 1 doctors) are for treating patients with cancer. Twenty-five FY 1 doctors and 15 senior doctors participated in interviews. We turned the emergent themes into a questionnaire for all 5143 UK FY 1 doctors in 2005. The response rate was 43 % (2062 responses). Sixty-one percent of FY 1 doctors had received oncology teaching at medical school, but 31 % recalled seeing fewer than 10 patients with cancer. Forty percent of FY 1 doctors felt prepared for looking after patients with cancer. Sixty-five percent felt prepared for diagnosing cancer, 15 % felt they knew enough about chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and 11 % felt prepared for dealing with oncological emergencies. Respondents believed medical students should learn about symptom control (71 %) and communication skills (41 %). Respondents who had received oncology teaching were more likely <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for looking after patients with cancer (OR 1. 52; 95 % CI 1. 14 – 2. 04). Preparedness also correlated with exposure to patients with cancer (OR 1. 48; 95 % CI 1. 22 – 1. 79). We have found worryingly low levels of exposure of medical students to patients with cancer. First foundation year doctors lack knowledge about cancer care and symptom control.

Only 10. 3 % to 55 % of stalking incidents are reported (Baum, Catalano, Rand, & Rose, 2009; Bjerregard, 2000; Tjaden & Thoennes, 1998) and rates of arrest, prosecution, and conviction of stalking offenders are even lower (Jordan et al. 2003; Storey & Hart, 2011; Tjaden & Thoennes, 1998). The current study looked to law enforcement to identify their beliefs about stalking which may impact the rates of formal legal action taken in stalking cases. Law enforcement responses were compared to a comparable group of victim advocates. Through various factor analyses and correlations, we found that participants who endorsed stalking myths reported using fewer informal helping strategies and found that characteristics of the victim and offender’s relationship was a substantial obstacle to handling stalking cases. Also, law enforcement officers gave more credit to stalking myths than did victim advocates even though their level of knowledge accuracy was very similar. No relationship was found between stalking knowledge accuracy and any criterion variable for either subpopulation group. Law enforcement officers and victim advocates both identified having difficulty determining what constituted stalking {{and how best to}} assess each situation implying that while trainings such as domestic violence may generalize to stalking, specialized stalking training is still warranted in order for officers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to handle stalking cases.

Risk factors for non-communicable disease are modifiable and health professionals are in an unique position to intervene and influence them. Design Clinical interventions were utilized as part of the Community Interventions for Health programme, a non-randomised, controlled study undertaken in three communities – one each in China, India and Mexico. Methods All clinicians in intervention and control areas of the study were invited to complete surveys. 2280 completed surveys at baseline and 2501 at follow-up. Culturally appropriate interventions to reduce tobacco use, improve dietary intake and increase physical activity were delivered in the intervention areas. Results Clinicians in the intervention group felt more prepared to advise smoking cessation and improvement of diet. They were more likely to test serum cholesterol and blood pressure but less likely to take measurements of height, hip, waist and skinfold thickness. There were more resources available to clinicians in the intervention group and they used counselling more and complementary medicine less than those in the control group. Conclusions Community interventions which have been shown to have a positive effect in the community and workplace also change clinical practice. Relevance to clinical practice Community interventions make clinicians, including nurses, more likely <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to offer advice and more likely to use counselling.

40|$|Background / Aims: Nursing {{students}} require {{access to}} relevant, quality clinical education and clinical placements <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared,</b> confident {{and ready to}} competently care for patients in a practice environment. This study aimed to examine factors that influence nursing students’ perceptions of preparedness for practice and to ascertain their level of confidence performing key practice skills independently. Methods: A cross-sectional study design. All third-year nursing students at a regional Australian university were emailed a link to an online version of the Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey following their final practicum. Demographic data and survey items were summarised using descriptive statistics. Analysis of variance was performed to compare results with demographic data. Correlation analysis was performed to test relationships between continuous variables. Results: Overall, students reported {{a high level of}} confidence and preparedness for clinical practice. The areas in which students lacked confidence were: managing multiple patient care assignments, independently performing venepuncture and assisting with intubation. The students did not feel simulation experiences adequately prepared them for clinical practice. The areas identified to enhance confidence and readiness for practice include: expanded practicum placements, more simulation or clinical skills practice, smaller clinical skills class sizes and the use of upto- date equipment during training. Conclusion: The results highlighted that students perceive placements and clinical skills practice as keys for enhancing readiness for practice and to facilitate a successful transition into professional nursing practice. The marked difference in hours of clinical practicum between Australian students and US students may explain differences in confidence levels upon graduation...|$|E

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore experiences of negative pressure wound therapy at home, {{in patients with}} deep perivascular groin infection after vascular surgery and management in daily life. Background Deep surgical site infection after vascular surgery with exposed vessels often requires long-term treatment with negative pressure wound therapy, and continued therapy at home has become routine. Design An explorative qualitative study. Methods Nine men and six women with a deep surgical site infection in the groin after vascular surgery, treated in their home with negative pressure wound therapy, were interviewed. The interviews were analysed using manifest and latent content analysis. Results Undergoing negative pressure wound therapy at home meant a transition from being a dependent patient {{to a person who}} must have self-care competence and be involved in their own care. A need <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for this before discharge from hospital was expressed. Lack of information and feelings of uncertainty prolonged the time before feeling confident in managing the treatment. The informants gradually accepted the need to be tied up to a machine, became competent in its management and found solutions to perform everyday tasks. Overall, {{it was a relief to}} be treated at home. Conclusions Several benefits of negative pressure wound therapy at home were expressed. However, unnecessary stress and anxiety were experienced due to a lack of information on the treatment and instruction concerning the equipment. Adequate information and education must therefore be provided to facilitate the transition from a patient to a person with self-care competence and ability to manage this treatment at home. Relevance to clinical practice The findings revealed a need for more support and knowledge in their transition from hospital care to home care with negative pressure wound therapy.

40|$|Alternative teacher {{certification}} (ATC) programs are one method created to help alleviate teacher shortages (Cox, Matthews, & Assoc, 2001; Hallinan & Khmelkov, 2001). While much debate has arisen over ATC programs, very few have empirically examined {{their impact on}} the teaching pool (Darling-Hammond, Berry, & Thoreson, 2001; Darling-Hammond, Chung, & Frelow, 2002; Goldhaber, 2000; Ingersoll, 1999; Shen, 1997, 1999). The present study was designed to explore differences by certification type and program characteristics based on novice teachers' demographics, educational attainment, sense of self-efficacy, and sense of preparedness to enter the classroom. Results from the present study suggest ATC programs are somewhat diversifying the teaching population by bringing in more minorities and science majors, but {{do not appear to be}} bringing in more experienced scientists and mathematicians nor do they appear to be alleviating the teacher shortage. In this sample, traditionally certified teachers felt better prepared than ATC teachers with the biggest differences on Promoting Student Learning. Regardless of certification route, prior classroom experience was a strong predictor of Overall Preparedness and a teacher's perception of his or her ability to be an effective teacher. For ATC teachers, a positive mentoring experience was a strong predictor of Overall Preparedness. The discussion of whether or not ATC programs should exist should now be replaced with a discussion of how to ensure that these programs produce better teachers and improve student learning. The underlying theme from the present study was that, in order <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> and have high self-efficacy, novice teachers needed instruction in the majority of the components identified by research and by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (1996), including positive mentoring experiences, field based experiences, and curriculum based on child development, learning theory, cognition, motivation, and subject matter pedagogy.

40|$|The {{persistent}} underachievement of U. S. {{students in}} the area of reading comprehension has been documented in numerous high profile reports. While there are likely many factors that contribute to this underachievement, it is significant that studies repeatedly demonstrate that U. S. children are not taught how to comprehend text and that teachers report feeling unprepared to teach students to do so. This dissertation examines reading comprehension instruction in seven 4 th and 5 th grade classrooms. The purpose of the study is to closely investigate what teachers know and do in the course of teaching reading comprehension in order to hypothesize why it is that most U. S. students do not learn to comprehend text well and what teachers would need to {{know and be able to}} do in order <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to teach reading comprehension skillfully. Drawing from a corpus of videotaped lessons, interviews with teachers about their work, and artifacts that purport to define the knowledge base for teaching reading comprehension, the study is organized around the following key questions: 1. What is it that a small sample of teachers are doing when they say they are teaching reading comprehension? 2. What are potential constraints and influences on teachers’ enactment of reading comprehension instruction? 3. How has the field of reading conceptualized the knowledge base for teaching reading comprehension? Findings from the study highlight several notable trends. First, while analysis of classroom data suggest considerable variability regarding what counts as reading comprehension instruction, this variability can, in part, be attributed to the ways in which reading comprehension instruction has been characterized in policy, assessments, and the resources that are available to teachers. Importantly, analyses expose a fundamental disjuncture between how leading literacy scholars define reading comprehension and how reading comprehension is conceptualized in other resources. Analyses also suggest that the knowledge base for teaching reading comprehension has been articulated in superficial ways and without the guidance of a coherent theoretical framework. The dissertation ends with a proposal of a theory of knowledge for teaching reading comprehension...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim of research: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that expectant and new fatherhood can be a time of confusion and stress and there is an increasing awareness of the importance of supporting men through this complex transition. The aim of this research was to create a depth of understanding regarding how men experience becoming a father for the first time, and to examine the breadth of the entire experience from the antenatal period through the first few weeks of life as 'father'. Method :A descriptive phenomenological approach was chosen for this research, due to its emphasis placed on examining phenomena as they are experienced by the individual in everyday life. Phenomenology allowed for the fathers' individual accounts of their transition and enabled them to discuss the aspects of their experience that they felt to be significant. Results: Eight first time fathers were interviewed, between ten and twelve weeks after the birth of their child. Analysis {{led to the development of}} a general structure of early fatherhood, detailing the essential aspects of the experience of becoming a father for the first time that were present for all fathers interviewed. Five constituents of the experience were identified, these were; 'travelling into the great unknown', 'tower of strength', 'oscillating reality', 'the intimate relationship with the baby', 'the new me'. Conclusions: The early experience of becoming a father for the first time is similar to undertaking a complex journey, involving preparation and attempts to create an understanding of the route they will take. A sense of newness exists within every aspect of the experience. Throughout the experience there are moments when the father has difficulty engaging with the reality of his impending or new fatherhood, yet he maintains a need to provide support for his partner. The birth brings with it the creation of the relationship between father and child, a relationship which affirms his new role. The findings of this research highlight the importance of assisting fathers with this journey, offering them the help and support they need to be able <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> and to have a clearer understanding of how to negotiate the various paths their new role may take them down.

Expressive art is a well-established tool to facilitate the expression of thoughts and feelings that can also be incorporated as interactive classroom activities—an approach that deviates from the traditional top-down teaching mode in China. A 3 -day experiential training program based on expressive arts and strength-focused approaches was provided for 57 elementary and high school teachers across the earthquake area. This study evaluated changes after the training program. Re-sults showed that teachers’ general self-efficacy and teaching efficacy were significantly improved (t = 2. 54, p =. 01; t = 4. 08, p =. 00).

40|$|This review {{examines}} the theoretical rationale for conceiving of systematic information processing as a proximal mechanism for perseverative worry. Systematic processing is characterised by detailed, analytical thought about issue-relevant information, {{and in this}} way, {{is similar to the}} persistent, detailed processing of information that typiﬁes perseverative worry. We review the key features and determinants of systematic processing, and examine the application of systematic processing to perseverative worry. We argue that systematic processing is a mechanism involved in perseverative worry because (1) systematic processing {{is more likely to be}} deployed when individuals feel that they have not reached a satisfactory level of conﬁdence in their judgement and this is similar to the worrier's striving <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> adequately <b>prepared,</b> <b>to</b> have considered every possible negative outcome/detect all potential danger, and to be sure that they will successfully cope with perceived future problems; (2) systematic processing and worry are inﬂuenced by similar psychological cognitive states and appraisals; and (3) the functional neuroanatomy underlying systematic processing is located in the same brain regions that are activated during worrying. This proposed mechanism is derived from core psychological processes and offers a number of clinical implications, including the identiﬁcation of psychological states and appraisals that may beneﬁt from therapeutic interventions for worry-based problems...|$|R

40|$|Excessive and {{uncontrollable}} {{worry is}} {{a defining feature of}} Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). An important endeavour {{in the treatment}} of pathological worry is to understand why some people are unable to stop worrying once they have started. Worry perseveration is associated with a tendency to deploy goal-directed worry rules (known as “as many as can” worry rules; AMA). These require attention to the goal of the worry task and continuation of worry until the aims of the “worry bout” are achieved. This study examined the association between the tendency to use AMA worry rules and neural and autonomic responses to a perseverative cognition induction. To differentiate processes underlying the AMA worry rule use from trait worry, we also examined the relationship between scores on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and neural and autonomic responses following the same induction. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) while measuring emotional bodily arousal from heart rate variability (where decreased HRV indicates stress-related parasympathetic withdrawal) in 19 patients with GAD and 21 control participants. Seed-based analyses were conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity (FC) with the amygdala. The tendency to adopt an AMA worry rule was associated with validated measures of worry, anxiety, depression and rumination. AMA worry rule endorsement predicted a stronger decrease in HRV and was positively associated with increased connectivity between right amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem noradrenergic projection nucleus. Higher AMA scores were also associated with increased connectivity between amygdala and rostral superior frontal gyrus. Higher PSWQ scores amplified decreases in FC between right amygdala and subcallosal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and areas of parietal cortex. Our results identify neural mechanisms underlying the deployment of AMA worry rules. We propose that the relationship between AMA worry rules and increased connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents attempts by high worriers to maintain arousal and distress levels in order <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for future threats. Furthermore, we suggest that neural mechanisms associated with the PSWQ represent effortful inhibitory control during worry. These findings provide unique information about the neurobiological processes that underpin worry perseveration...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this article}} is to compare {{students}} of human medicine (HM) with students specialising in the MINT disciplines (mathematics, computer science, natural sciences and engineering), the humanities and social sciences as well as law and economic sciences with regard to their expectations of their university study and career and the areas of competence where they feel they have been supported by their education. We present in detail issues particularly relevant to prospective physicians, which are discussed with the main focus on the “theoretical and practical orientation of medical education”. Methods: We used the database in the Public Use File of the “ 11 Student Survey”, a written survey of randomly selected students studying at 25 German tertiary institutions during the 2009 / 2010 winter term, which was supplied by the Tertiary Education Research working group at the University of Constance. Data on 7536 students was included, of which 488 (6. 5 %) were prospective physicians. Results: Human medicine students have a clear career aim and want to complete their education quickly. They have a far above-average interest in working with and for people. About one student in two is interested in a career in science or research (53 % in each case – close to the average for all subjects). Compared with the other disciplines, HM students are most likely to consider their university education to have practical and research relevance and are most likely <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for their profession. Yet over half of all students (Ø 53. 3 %; HM 54. 5 %) do not consider their education to have fostered their research skills. MINT students in particular are better able to enhance their skills through independent experimentation, while theory and practice are more likely to be communicated academically in the regular teaching of human medicine. Accordingly, the HM students feel less well supported in some areas of competence required for their later work than students in other disciplines, in developing independence, problem-solving ability, critical ability and capacity for teamwork for example. Conclusion: The high expectations held by human medicine students of being prepared for practical work with/on people are met to an above-average degree according to their assessments of the “practical relevance” and “career preparation” offered by their medical education. However the perceived development of skills in theory and practice does not respond sufficiently well to the demands of the complex, responsible profession they aspire to. Medical students should be better supported in developing both practical and academic independence...|$|E
40|$|Educators Selection of Pedagogical Strategies to Prepare the Entry Level Athletic Trainer on Techniques Related to Sudden Death in Sport Salvatore AS, Mazerolle SM, Yabor TM, Pagnotta KD, Casa DJ: University of Connecticut, Storrs; CT. Context: Educational {{training}} {{is an important}} factor for the athletic trainer to gain appropriate knowledge and clinical competence. Unfortunately, not all athletic trainers receive proper training and feedback regarding topics related to sudden death in sport, particularly EHS. Objective: To gain a more in-depth understanding of the educational training provided to the athletic training student regarding sudden death in sport, beyond EHS. Design: An inductive qualitative study utilizing phone interviewing. Setting: Athletic Training Education Programs. Patients or Other Participants: 12 faculty members (8 males; 4 females) in athletic training programs accredited by Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). Years of Board Certification was 15 ± 9 years, while the average years as a faculty member was 13 ± 8 years, and the average years worked clinically was 11 ± 10. Data Collection and Analysis: One-on-one phone interviews following a semi-structured format were conducted with all participants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and shared with participants prior to analysis. Interviews were analyzed inductively borrowing from the principles of a grounded theory approach and open coding. Multiple analyst triangulation and peer review were included as steps to establish data credibility. Results: Two dominant themes emerged from the data: current trends and instructional methods. Current trends were classified as those topics related to sudden death that were considered to be “hot topics” within the media. Although information presented was driven by the NATA Position Statements, considerable attention was spent on cardiac, cervical spine, and head injuries, while limited time was focused on heat illnesses, asthma, or anaphylaxis. The theme was also reflective of regional bias as well as individual professional experiences of the instructors teaching the material. Together these factors influenced how much time was dedicated to and how in-depth each of the conditions of sudden death were covered. Instructional methods reflects the faculty members attempt to provide “real life” learning experiences through simulations and case studies, which ultimately yielded little clinical skill integration and relied more on discourse. Also, educators relied on time spent in clinical education as means to hopefully provide real-time exposure in emergency situations. Conclusions: Management of sudden death in sport requires the athletic trainer to be prepared to act quickly, efficiently, while following the recommended practices. Athletic training educators must be prepared, regardless of their previous experiences or personal biases, to provide educational training regarding most causes of sudden death in sport. Furthermore, to facilitate clinical integration and competency, the student must be challenged to implement their knowledge and skill in order <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> to appropriately respond to an emergency situation. Exposure to every medical emergency is implausible, yet opportunities must be afforded to the student to implement their critical decision making abilities. Word Count: 44...|$|E
30|$|Lastly, {{within this}} study, it was {{requested}} by the leaders to have more in-depth training prior to and during program implementation. Although the requested training was for issues that were {{not directly related to}} the program curriculum it is important that leaders <b>feel</b> competent <b>to</b> be able to deal effectively with all aspects of the program and not just the skills and activities planned for the program sessions. This is consistent with previous TPSR process evaluations that struggled with adequate training for their leaders as “it is not realistic to expect that the Youth Leaders can learn to become effective TPSR leaders through mere observation or through a 10  minute discussion before or after the first session” (Wright et al. 2012 p. 20). Therefore, more training prior, particularly related to managing social cliques and discussing ongoing personal challenges of the youth, may be particularly important for leaders working with all-female programming. In the second year of the GJWHF the program leaders met every two weeks with the professor overseeing this project to discuss successes and ongoing concerns and planned for the two upcoming sessions. This enabled the leaders <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> better <b>prepared</b> and allowed for more program flexibility based on the youth’s choice of sport or PA and enabled a better integration of the life skill within the chosen activity.|$|R
40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} during {{childhood and adolescence}} poses a problem in many schools. Children with social behavior problems often pose a challenge for their classmates, teachers and parents. Since the family is a central factor of influence in a child’s socialization, a lot of programs that support parents in the child rearing process were developed during the last years. These so-called parent trainings are usually conducted by professionals {{from the field of}} educational sciences or psychology. But how does the rating of such a program by the course instructors influence its effects? The present contribution focuses on the examination of the perceived usefulness and acceptability of the MonteBaRo-training as rated by newly trained course instructors. Additionally it was analyzed how these subjective ratings influenced the intended implementation of the training (i. e. anticipated deviation from the training’s manual). In summary, newly trained course instructors very high ratings for gave the training course, as well as the usefulness of the program and its materials and the extent <b>to</b> which they <b>feel</b> <b>prepared</b> for conducting own courses. No significant correlations were found between these indicators and the anticipated deviation from the training’s manual...|$|R
40|$|Resonance {{interventions}} {{are aimed at}} developing awareness of how one wants <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> how <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> this way, the obstacles that {{get in the way}} of that desired <b>feel,</b> and how <b>to</b> reconnect with it through individual or group sessions led by a consultant (Newburg, Kimiciek, Durand-Bush, & Doell, 2002; Arcand, Durand-Bush, & Miall, 2007). The purpose of this study was to examine how a coach developed and applied the process of resonance with his team through a resonance intervention facilitated by a researcher/consultant and continued nurturing this process once the intervention was completed. The participants included a varsity volleyball team comprising a 39 year old male coach and 16 female athletes aged between 18 - 24 years. The 26 -week study comprised three phases: a 6 -week pre-intervention phase involving interviews and observations; a 14 -week intervention phase involving four team sessions, individual consultations with the coach, participant journaling, and observations; and a 6 -week post-intervention phase involving interviews. The results are presented as a narrative (Polkinghorne, 1995) to tell the story of how the researcher/consultant worked with the team as a group and also individually with the coach to help them learn and apply their personal resonance process and enhance their performance, leading them to a OUA Championship title...|$|R
