5000|$|Nicotine {{replacement}} therapy (NRT) {{is the general}} term for using products that contain nicotine but not <b>tobacco</b> to <b>aid</b> cessation of smoking. These include nicotine lozenges that are sucked, nicotine gum and inhalers, nicotine patches, as well as electronic cigarettes.|$|R
5000|$|Herbal {{smokeless}} tobacco is any product that imitates types of {{smokeless tobacco}} (chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuff, snus, etc.) {{but does not}} contain either tobacco and nicotine, or tobacco while still retaining nicotine. Like herbal cigarettes and electronic cigarettes, they are often used as a <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aid.</b> [...] Herbal smokeless tobacco use is an alternative to using smokeless tobacco that may help users quit.|$|R
50|$|Herbal {{cigarettes}} (also called tobacco-free cigarettes or nicotine-free cigarettes) are cigarettes that do {{not contain}} any tobacco, instead being composed of a mixture of various herbs and/or other plant material. Like herbal smokeless tobacco, they are often used {{as a substitute for}} standard tobacco products (primarily cigarettes), and many times are promoted as a <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aid.</b> Herbal cigarettes are also used in acting scenes by performers who are non-smokers, or—as is becoming increasingly common—where anti-smoking legislation prohibits the use of tobacco in public spaces.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is part of an attempt to establish an in vitro fertilization system in <b>tobacco</b> to <b>aid</b> in understanding mechanisms of fertilization. Fusions of isolated male and female gametes were induced in a polyethylene glycol solution. Fusion appears similar to that in maize. One nuclear division of both an unfertilized egg cell and a synergid was induced in KM 8 p medium with 1 mg/l 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in a microchamber culture; one cellular division of the egg cell was also induced in the same medium in solid-drop culture. The osmolality of suspension culture feeder cells was critical for the development of these cells. These results indicate that in vitro fertilization is possible in tobacco, which would be the first such system in dicots...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since {{the initial}} {{report on the}} {{negative}} effects of smoking by the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, the components of cigarettes and tobacco smoke and the mechanisms by which these cause disease have been studied extensively. Despite the well-documented health consequences associated with tobacco use, nearly 70 million Americans over the age of 12 actively use tobacco products, with 57. 5 million of these (22. 1 % of the U. S. population in this age range) actively smoking cigarettes. Understanding how nicotine addiction develops and reinforces itself is important context for understanding the high prevalence of quit interest among smokers and the high relapse rates associated with quit attempts. While the increased availability of different, clinically proven <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aids</b> should lower the barrier associated with tobacco abstinence, the prevalence of quit aid use still remains low among those attempting to quit smoking. This study examines quit interest in active smokers, the quit attempts attempted by current and former smokers, the prevalence of <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aid</b> use in these quit attempts, and the perceived efficacy of certain quit aids. METHODS: This study was conducted in the Emergency Departments of ten hospitals nationwide by the National Association of Research Associates Programs in 2012. This study utilized trained research staff to enroll non-emergent patients and visitors over the age of 18 years old, obtaining demographical information and a detailed history of tobacco use from the participant. This included such information as current tobacco use status, how many cigarettes were consumed during a typical day, how many times they had attempted to abstain from tobacco use in the past, if they had used any <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aids</b> during those quit attempts, and, if so, how effective they believed these aids were. Participants were also asked to rate their readiness to quit smoking and intent to quit smoking, markers this study used to analyze quit interest. RESULTS: Of those approached, 10, 303 study participants were selected for inclusion in this study, reporting tobacco use for longer than one month at any point in their life. 50. 5 % reported current tobacco use, while 46. 8 % reported current abstention from smoking. A majority of active smokers expressed interest in initiating tobacco cessation, with 55. 2 % reporting they were ready to quit smoking, though a smaller majority (51. 9 %) of active smokers reported that they intended to quit smoking. Most smokers reported at least 1 quit attempt in the past, with 76. 5 % of former smokers reporting that they quit within 1 to 5 attempts. Only 30. 7 % of study participants reported ever using some form of <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aid</b> in previous quit attempts, with nicotine replacement therapy use being the most commonly reported, and with pharmacological interventions more commonly reported than counseling-based cessation interventions. A majority of participants who reported using nicotine replacement gum and lozenges (57. 8 % and 49. 5 %, respectfully) reported that they were not helpful in aiding their cessation attempts, with only 30. 1 % of gum and 38. 7 % of lozenge users reporting a positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that among active smokers, smokers that reported smoking less (only some days or fewer cigarettes per day) were more likely to express interest (readiness and intent) in initiating tobacco cessation than those that reported smoking more (every day or more cigarettes per day). Quit interest also appeared to be lowest in 18 - 25 year olds, with this age group also reporting the lowest proportion of quit attempts, a finding that differed from another national tobacco survey. The prevalence of quit aid use in our study was comparable to another national tobacco survey, but our findings for the prevalence of unassisted quit attempts did not coincide with results found in other studies. These results also indicated that cessation aid use increased with increased number of quit attempts. Though we found that former smokers were more likely to indicate that NRT products were helpful than active smokers were, we were unable to fully analyze the perceived effects of cessation aid use due to the loss of some of this data. In light of the limitations of this study, further study needs to be conducted to better understand the perceived effect of <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aids</b> and how this might differ from the efficacy values found in clinical trials. In order to make findings more comparable to other tobacco surveys, future studies should also be designed around clear and common definitions for active tobacco use and quit interest, and a focus on quit attempts should be modulated by some degree of recency (e. g., quit attempts made within the previous year or two years) ...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand is a {{relatively}} poor contributor of financial aid to developing countries – with a rank of 15 th in the OECD. Given the poverty and poor health status within some Pacific Island Countries (PICs), there is an ethical imperative to do more. This imperative is strengthened by {{the need for the}} remediation of current and past harms to the health of Pacific peoples (eg, from New Zealand <b>tobacco</b> exports). Development <b>aid</b> can also lead to direct and indirect health (and other) benefits for New Zealand. These benefits are most obvious for communicable disease control (eg, for tuberculosis, measles, pandemic influenza, and vector-borne diseases). These benefits will apply more broadly to any health intervention of relevance to the Pacific Island community in New Zealand (eg, diabetes prevention programmes). The reduction of poverty and population stabilisation in PICs may also enhance regional stability. Such stability would benefit New Zealand in terms of trade, reduced needs for peacekeeping, and a lowered risk of refugees arising from internal conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Youth {{and young}} adults with mental health {{disorders}} and addictions are at {{a high risk of}} becoming nicotine dependent, and at least half will die of tobacco-related diseases. In comparison to the general population, this population also faces neurobiological and psychosocial vulnerabilities. There is a critical need for community services and research targeting tobacco interventions for these individuals. Methods. A concurrent mixed methods study was conducted by collecting data from in-depth key informant interviews, focus groups, and a survey. Qualitative key informant interviews with healthcare professionals (n = 11) and youth focus groups (n = 32) were conducted by using semi-structured questioning regarding barriers and facilitators to tobacco interventions. Content analysis was used to code transcripts and categorize themes. Survey data were also collected from 230 smokers ages 13 to 17 years (n = 62) {{and young adults}} ages 18 to 25 years (n = 40) at three community mental health centers. The survey inquired about tobacco use, motivation to quit, history of quit attempts, and treatment preferences. Results. Five thematic categories were identified in both the adult key informant interviews and the focus groups with youth: (1) motivation to quit, (2) cessation treatment needs, (3) social influence, (4) barriers to treatment, and (5) tobacco-free policy. Among those surveyed, 44 % currently smoked. Youth and young adult survey respondents who smoked were often motivated to quit, few had used proven <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aids,</b> but there was interest in access to nicotine replacement therapy. Conclusion. Merged qualitative and quantitative findings support past literature regarding youth in the general population but also expand upon our knowledge of issues specific to youth and young adults with mental health disorders and addictions. Findings suggest interventions warranting further attention in community treatment settings...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco use {{remains the}} leading cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the US. Effective <b>tobacco</b> cessation <b>aids</b> are widely available, yet underutilized. Tobacco cessation brief interventions (BIs) increase quit rates. However, BI training has focused on conventional medical providers, overlooking other health practitioners with regular contact with tobacco users. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey found that approximately 20 % of those who use provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are tobacco users. Thus, CAM practitioners potentially represent a large, untapped community resource for promoting tobacco cessation and use of effective cessation aids. Existing BI training is not well suited for CAM practitioners' background and practice patterns, because it assumes a conventional biomedical foundation of knowledge and philosophical approaches to health, healing and the patient-practitioner relationship. There is a pressing need to develop and test the effectiveness of BI training that is both grounded in Public Health Service (PHS) Guidelines for tobacco dependence treatment and that is relevant and appropriate for CAM practitioners. METHODS/DESIGN: The CAM Reach (CAMR) intervention is a tobacco cessation BI training and office system intervention tailored specifically for chiropractors, acupuncturists and massage therapists. The CAMR study utilizes a single group one-way crossover design to examine the CAMR intervention's impact on CAM practitioners' tobacco-related practice behaviors. Primary outcomes included CAM practitioners' self-reported conduct of tobacco use screening and BIs. Secondary outcomes include tobacco using patients' readiness to quit, quit attempts, use of guideline-based treatments, and quit rates and also non-tobacco-using patients' actions to help someone else quit. DISCUSSION: CAM practitioners provide care to significant numbers of tobacco users. Their practice patterns and philosophical approaches to health and healing are well suited for providing BIs. The CAMR study is examining the impact of the CAMR intervention on practitioners' tobacco-related practice behaviors, CAM patient behaviors, and documenting factors important to the conduct of practice-based research in real-world CAM practices...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} (i) {{describe}} concurrent and simultaneous tobacco and cannabis use and (ii) investigate {{the association between}} cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco {{in a sample of}} socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 with current <b>tobacco</b> smokers receiving <b>aid</b> from two community service organizations in New South Wales, Australia. At least weekly cannabis use for the month prior to survey, motivation to quit tobacco and intentions to quit tobacco were measured in 369 participants (77 % consent rate). Regressions were carried out to investigate associations between weekly cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco. Concurrent tobacco and cannabis use was reported by 19 % (n= 71) of the sample and of these users, 100 % reported simultaneous use. Although regular cannabis use was significantly associated with lower motivation to quit tobacco, it was not significantly associated with intentions to quit tobacco in the next 30 days. Concurrent cannabis use is common in disadvantaged smokers and {{may play a role in}} decreased motivation to quit tobacco; however, it does not appear to be associated with intentions to quit in a sample of disadvantaged smokers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—There is {{a growing}} body of {{knowledge}} about the pregnant smoker and what happens as she goes through the pregnancy and postpartum periods. This article reviews the process of smoking cessation in the context of pregnancy.  DATA SOURCES—Epidemiological data, extant reviews of the literature, and current original research reports are used to examine characteristics of the women and of the change process for those women smokers who quit, stop, or modify their smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period.  DATA SYNTHESIS—An analysis of the interaction of the process of smoking cessation with pregnancy was conducted to gain insight into the unique problems faced by the pregnant smoker and discover directions for intervention.  CONCLUSIONS—Pregnancy and the postpartum period provide a window of opportunity to promote smoking cessation and smoke free families. Understanding obstacles and pathways for pregnancy and postpartum smoking cessation can guide implementation of effective existing programs and development of new ones. Recommendations include promoting cessation before and at the beginning of pregnancy, increasing delivery of treatment early in pregnancy, helping spontaneous and intervention assisted quitters to remain <b>tobacco</b> free postpartum, <b>aiding</b> late pregnancy smokers, and involving the partner of the woman smoker.    Keywords: pregnancy; smoking; process of change; relaps...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine the}} impact of the new Canadian tobacco package warning labels with a quitline {{toll-free}} phone number for seven provincial quitlines, focusing on treatment reach and reach equity in selected vulnerable groups. MethodsA quasi-experimental design assessed changes in new incoming caller characteristics, treatment reach for selected vulnerable sub-populations {{and the extent to which}} this reach is equitable, before and after the introduction of the labels in June, 2012. Administrative call data on smokers were collected at intake. Pre- and post-label treatment reach and reach equity differences were analysed by comparing the natural logarithms of the reach and reach equity statistics. ResultsDuring the six months following the introduction of the new warning labels, 86. 4 % of incoming new callers indicated seeing the quitline number on the labels. Treatment reach for the six-month period significantly improved compared to the same six-month period the year before from. 042 % to. 114 % (p<. 0001) and reach equity significantly improved for young males (p<. 0001) and those with high school education or less (p=. 004). ConclusionsThe introduction of the new tobacco warning labels with a quitline toll-free number in Canada was associated with an increase in treatment reach. The toll-free number on <b>tobacco</b> warning labels <b>aided</b> in reducing <b>tobacco</b> related inequalities, such as improved reach equity for young males and those with high school or less education...|$|R
40|$|Background: Asthma in {{childhood}} {{is a major}} public health issue. Objective: To estimate prevalence and associated housing environment factors of asthma among school children. Material & Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among school children aged six to fifteen years. Standard ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children) Core Questionnaire for Asthma was used for determining the prevalence of wheezing and asthma. Demographic, housing and indoor pollution factors were collected. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 15. Results: Prevalence of ‘wheeze ever’ and ‘current wheezers’ was 10 % and 9 % respectively.   Physician diagnosed asthma was seen in 6. 3 %. Severe asthma was noted in 28. 6 % of current wheezerswith 84. 6 % and 8. 8 % having one to two and four to 12 wheezing attacks per year respectively. Wheezing was present post exercise in 5. 4 %, nocturnal cough in 6. 1 %, sleep disturbance less than one night/week (40. 7 %), one or more nights/week (3. 3 %) and wheezing limiting speech to few words between breaths (20. 9 %). Prevalence was greater among boys (9. 8 %) than girls (7. 5 %) and maximal in age group eight to nine years. On multiple logistic regression presence of overcrowding and absence of smoke outlet {{were significantly associated with}} current wheeze. Socio-economic status, beedi rolling practices and absence of separate kitchen was statistically significant with severe asthma. Conclusions: Current wheezer prevalence was 9 % and more in boys. Adoption of improved housing conditions and avoiding environmental <b>tobacco</b> exposure may <b>aid</b> in reducing childhood asthma attacks in this developing city...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{associated}} with high rates of comorbid substance use disorders, and cigarette smoking has a particularly high prevalence in this population. However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether this tobacco use is an attempt at "self-medication" or due to behavioral disinhibition. There is a surprising lack of qualitative studies that investigate the subjective perceptions of adults with ADHD regarding cigarette smoking. The present {{study was designed to}} fill this gap in the literature. METHODS We recruited twelve adult patients with ADHD and comorbid tobacco use from our ADHD consultation service, an outpatient facility of the Zurich University Psychiatric Hospital. Subjects were interviewed using qualitative methodology, and Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate findings. RESULTS We identified two explanatory models linking ADHD and tobacco use: smoking as an attempt at self-medication and "smoking as a social behavior". On one hand, subjects considered <b>tobacco</b> a therapeutic <b>aid,</b> reporting positive effects on "inner tension" and cognitive function, and noted possible antidepressant properties as well. On the other hand, subjects considered smoking to enhance social functioning and to {{have a positive impact on}} interpersonal relationships. The majority believed that stimulant medications offered only a transient decrease in patterns of tobacco use because their ability to reduce nicotine cravings wore off quickly. Others believed that stimulants had no effect or even reinforced cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS Participants had different views about the link between cigarette smoking and ADHD. While the majority thought of nicotine as a sort of therapy, viewing smoking as a way to self-medicate symptoms of ADHD, motivations for nicotine use were also related to self-image, desire to belong to a peer-group, and a drive to undermine perceived social norms. Ultimately, these findings can be used by clinicians to improve treatment alliance and collaboration...|$|R
