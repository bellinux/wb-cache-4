Among these traits: no tribal chief, no tribal 'villages', different 'clothes', different weapons, different tribal ceremonies, no 'tobacco-licking' oath, different care of the dead, cannibalism, and different myths.|$|R

The actor also filmed in Guadalajara, Los Inquilinos, playing a janitor in a multifamily complex where a series of supernatural events occur. The film also features Mexican actors Erick Elías and Danny Perea. About his role and the thriller genre, Hernández stated, [...] "It is a genre that is not very common in Mexico and from the little I have seen it falls into clichés, laughter effects, and creating little monsters. What attracted me to this film was the script; is a psychological thriller that takes you down to ground level: circumstances that can happen everyday, but that also have a thriller vibe".|$|R

5000|$|The tour is most infamous, however, for the {{gigantic}} Stonehenge props the band used. Iommi recalls {{in his autobiography}} that it was Butler's idea but the designers took his measurements the wrong way {{and thought it was}} meant to be life-size. Months later, while rehearsing for the tour at the Birmingham NEC, the stage set arrived. [...] "We were in shock," [...] writes Iommi. [...] "This stuff was coming in and in and in. It had all these huge columns in the back that were as wide as your average bedroom, the columns in front were about 13 feet high, and we had all the monitors and the side fills as well as all this rock. It was made of fiberglass and wood, and bloody heavy." [...] The set would be lampooned in Rob Reiner's 1984 rock music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, with the band having the opposite problem of having to use miniature Stonehenge stage props. Butler has said that he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>associate</b> scriptwriter of <b>the</b> film the story of the band's performances with their [...] "Stonehenge" [...] stage props. In an interview for the documentary Black Sabbath: 1978-1992, Gillan claims Don Arden had the dwarf walk across the top of the Stonehenge props at the start of the show and, as the tape of the screaming baby faded away, fall back [...] "from about thirty-five feet in the air on this big pile of mattresses. And then, 'Dong!' The bells start and the monks come out, the whole thing. Pure Spinal Tap." [...] The band toured Europe first, playing the Reading Festival (a performance that is included on the 2011 deluxe edition of Born Again) and also playing in a bullring in Barcelona in September. Sabbath performed Gillan's hit with Deep Purple, [...] "Smoke on the Water", on the tour, with Iommi explaining in his memoir, [...] "it seemed like a bum deal for him not to do any of his stuff while he was doing all of ours. I don't know if we played it properly but the audience loved it. The critics moaned; it was something out of the bag and they didn't want to know then." [...] In October, the band took the Stonehenge set to America but could only use a portion of it at most gigs because the columns were too high. The set was eventually abandoned. A music video for [...] "Zero the Hero" [...] was also released, featuring performance footage of the band onstage interspersed with scenes involving several grotesque characters performing experiments on a witless young man in a haunted house filled with rats, roosters and even a roaming horse. Like most of <b>the</b> accoutrements <b>associated</b> with <b>the</b> tour, it was more unintentionally funny than scary.|$|R

50|$|In some traditions {{attributed}} to Imām Muhammad al-Baqir {{the number of}} the years which had to elapse before the emergence of the Mahdi was specified. For example, a close associate of Imam al-Baqir called Abu Hamzah Thabit ibn Dinar, recalled in the presence of Imam al-Baqir what Imam Ali had said {{about the end of the}} period of trial for the Shi’a after 70 years, which would be followed by a period of ease and comfort. Abu Hamza complained that the period had elapsed without the prophecy being fulfilled. Imam al-Baqir explained that God initially did set the time for the Mahdi’s appearance at 70 years. However, when Husayn ibn Ali was killed the time was postponed to 140 years. This time span (of 140 years) was kept a secret and was only <b>told</b> to <b>the</b> close <b>associates</b> of <b>the</b> Imams. However, when <b>the</b> close <b>associates</b> revealed <b>the</b> time span to others, God delayed the appearance of the Mahdi for a further period. This time period is known only to God.|$|R
