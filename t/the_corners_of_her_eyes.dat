2500|$|Vanderbilt {{was born}} on February 20, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, {{the only child of}} {{railroad}} heir Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt (1880–1925) and his second wife, Gloria Morgan (1904–1965). When Gloria was born, her father was heard to exclaim in delight, [...] "It is fantastic how Vanderbilt she looks! See <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> how they turn up?" [...] She was baptized in the Episcopal church by Bishop Herbert Shipman as Gloria Laura Vanderbilt. After her father's death, she was confirmed and raised in the Catholic Church, to which her mother belonged. From her father's first marriage, to Cathleen Neilson, she had a half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt (1904–1944).|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and looked at me. She had a trick of {{contracting}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> just a little, which was absolutely bewitching.|$|E
60|$|I looked. Hendrika was {{tramping}} {{along with}} the child {{in her arms and}} staring at me in a most sinister fashion out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} subtlest of smiles flickered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth quivered, {{her eyes}} fell.|$|R
60|$|The Comtesse {{looked at}} him lazily out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sleepy eyes.|$|R
60|$|When {{the door}} had shut behind them Madame looked at Juliette, who with her new watch held to her ear, {{observed}} her out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{poor house}} is for pilgrims and merchants, not for famous knights; yet, sirs, I {{welcome you to}} it," [...] she said presently, {{scanning}} them out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|And he {{laid his}} large, yet well-shapen workman's hand {{on the top of}} the stove, that was {{polished}} black and smooth as velvet. She would not look at him, yet she glanced out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a little twitch at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{said nothing}} further on the subject, but <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth rearranged themselves.|$|R
60|$|And, blowing <b>her</b> eyes on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shawl, Maud shot {{away like}} a comic.|$|R
60|$|The very faintest of smiles parted her lips, a {{smile that}} {{wrinkled}} at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and suddenly altered her appearance so that Deane was forced to recognize the charm which even to himself he had denied.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} stalwart, quiet policemen {{requested}} loiterers to move on, and the loiterers obeyed and re-formed in groups behind them; {{here and there}} a respectable woman pushed her way through the throng, gathering up her skirts as she did so and glancing covertly at this unaccustomed company out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come on, Liza, don't tike on; I didn't mean no offence.' And {{he put his}} arm {{round her}} waist and led her to take their places at the gallery door. Two tears escaped from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and ran down her nose, but she felt very {{relieved}} and happy, and let him lead her where he would.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell looked {{straight}} {{at him with a}} faint smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick look, and a smile quivered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a {{slightly}} contemptuous curl appeared at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She {{swore that}} she was. And indeed {{her cheeks were}} ruddy with outdoors, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> relaxed. But she was so stiff that they had hobbled a mile, and Father had shucked several tons of corn in return for breakfast, before she ceased feeling as though her legs were made of {{extraordinarily}} brittle glass.|$|E
60|$|Miss Deringham {{understood}} him, {{and reflected}} as {{she glanced at}} him out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> that her father would do well if he dealt openly with this man. She fancied he could be remorseless in a reckoning, and she had now and then of late had unpleasant suspicions respecting Deringham's intentions concerning him.|$|E
60|$|What {{would people}} do if this {{convenient}} shelter of duty did not afford them a retreat {{in cases when}} they are disposed to change their minds? Susan suppressed the arch smile that, in spite of herself, laughed out at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and told her sister that she was much obliged to her for her care. So off they went together.|$|E
60|$|She sighed as {{she took}} it, and a wistful smile {{invested}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|Celia's rare tears had {{got into}} <b>her</b> eyes, and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth were agitated.|$|R
60|$|Dora watched <b>her</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye {{as a cat}} {{watches a}} mouse.|$|R
6000|$|While he was {{speaking}} Queen Cor had been studying the boy's face stealthily, from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she said to herself: [...] "He is so small and innocent that I believe I can capture him alone, and with ease. He does not seem very terrible and I suspect that King Gos and his warriors were frightened at nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus spoke Godfrey, {{drawing up}} his tall, slim young form {{to its full}} height, his dark eyes flashing, his fine face alight with righteous rage. Isobel, who was {{standing}} quite still and smiling a little, rather contemptuously, looked at him out of <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and thought that anger became him well. Never before had he seemed so handsome to her approving judgment.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ow dirty I am, bein' {{around the}} w'y I 'ave," [...] the woman said, {{as she sat}} down in a coffee-house, wiping the sleep and grime from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "An' the sights I 'ave seen this d'y, an' I enjoyed it, though it was lonesome by myself. An' the duchesses an' the lydies 'ad sich gran' w'ite dresses. They was jest bu'ful, bu'ful." ...|$|E
60|$|Virginia did not deign {{a direct}} reply to this, save by <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Riddel {{gave her}} head a toss, and {{regarded}} him from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|She became indiscreet. She {{looked at}} him with a little smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's HER doin', then," [...] {{returned}} Arthur, with a laugh. [...] "She's always lookin' round <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at me {{when she}} passes. Why, John Rogers was joking me about her only yesterday, and said McGee would blow a hole through me some of these days if I didn't look out! Of course," [...] he added, affectedly curling his moustache, [...] "that's nonsense! But {{you know how they}} talk, and she's too pretty for that fellow McGee." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} start or twitch, as if dazed. Then {{she looked up}} at her husband with a queer smile, {{puckering}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> He looked at the cigarettes, not at her. His face had the blunt voluptuous gravity of a young lion, a great cat. She kept him standing for some moments impassively. Then suddenly she hung her long, delicate fingers over the box, in doubt, and spasmodically jabbed at the cigarettes, clumsily raking one out at last.|$|E
60|$|Lord Martindale {{met them}} with his grave kind welcome, which awed even Helen into quiet and decorum, though perhaps, from <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she was spying the Scagliola columns as places for hide-and-seek. She opened them to their roundest extent as her grandmamma came down-stairs, {{and she tried to}} take shelter behind her brother from the ceremonious kiss, while Johnnie tightly {{squeezed}} his aunt's hand, and Lady Martindale was quite as much afraid of them as they could be of her.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> black eyes. This Adrian knew too much.|$|R
60|$|JENNY [appearing at {{the shelter}} door with a plaster on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth] Yes, Major.|$|R
60|$|Eva {{took it and}} smiled, {{though there}} was still a nervous twiching about <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
