Using a modified tight-binding formalism that incorporates the effect of <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> on conduction band changes, we calculate how threshold current density and slope efficiency are affected by <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> in the presence of tensile strain and n-type doping. Our results show that while there exists a negative interaction between <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> and n-type doping, tensile strain can be effectively combined with <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> to dramatically improve the Ge gain medium in terms of both reducing the threshold and increasing the expected slope efficiency. Through quantitative modeling we find the best design to include large amounts of both <b>tin</b> <b>alloying</b> and tensile strain but only moderate amounts of n-type doping if researchers seek to achieve the best possible performance in a Ge-based laser.

40|$|The LHC superconducting cables are {{submitted}} to a 200 °C heat-treatment in air {{in order to increase}} the resistance between the crossing strands (RC) within the cable. During this treatment the as-applied Sn-Ag alloy strand coating is transformed into a CuSn intermetallic compound layer. The microstructure, the surface topography and the surface chemistry of the non-reacted and reacted coatings have been characterised by different techniques, notably focused ion beam (FIB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on the results obtained by these techniques the different influences that the intermetallics have on RC are discussed. The desired RC is obtained only when a continuous Cu 3 Sn layer is formed, i. e. a sufficient wetting of the Cu substrate by the <b>tinning</b> <b>alloy</b> is crucial. Among other effects the formation of the comparatively hard intermetallics roughens the surface and, thus, reduces the true contact area and it strongly affects the oxide growth on the strand surface. The oxide formed on the fully reacted coatings, which may contain essentially Cu-oxides, appears to be more stable, both mechanically and thermally, as compared to the oxide formed on the <b>tinning</b> <b>alloy...</b>|$|R

50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including accelerator pedal position sensors (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and <b>tin</b> <b>alloy</b> surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface.

After filing the patent, T.I. immediately began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In October 1962, they announced the first commercial LED product (the SNX-100), which sold for a price of $130 per unit. The SNX-100 employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 900 nm light output.

50|$|Pure {{aluminium}} naturally forms a thin {{surface layer}} of aluminium oxide on contact with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in most environments. Aluminium alloys, however, offer little protection against corrosion. There are three main ways to passivate these alloys: alclading, chromate conversion coating and anodizing. Alclading {{is the process of}} metallurgically bonding a thin layer of pure aluminium to the aluminium alloy. Chromate conversion coating is a common way of passivating not only aluminum, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and <b>tin</b> <b>alloys.</b> Anodizing forms a thick oxide coating. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides good electrical insulation, which the other two processes do not.|$|R
