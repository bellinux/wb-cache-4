25|$|In {{boundary}} scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs {{on the board}} form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard <b>test</b> <b>configuration</b> procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) standard. The JTAG test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes. JTAG tool vendors provide various types of stimulus and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.|$|E

The resultant set of <b>test</b> <b>configurations</b> and vectors detect all single and multiple stuck-at faults (including line and transistor faults) {{as well as all}} brid ging faults in the PLA. Previously proposed test methods proposed for EEPROM based PLAs [1, 2] require additional test hardware as well as a large number of <b>test</b> <b>configurations</b> and vectors for complete testing. Our approach requires no modification to the PLA and only two or four <b>test</b> <b>configurations,</b> depending on the ratio of PLA product terms to inputs...|$|R

2500|$|As part of Operation Tinderbox, on June 24, 1980, a small {{satellite}} prototype (DSCS III) {{was subjected}} to radioactivity from the [...] "Huron King" [...] shot in a vertical line-of-sight (VLOS) test undertaken in Area 3. This was a program to improve the database on nuclear hardening design techniques for defense satellites. The VLOS <b>test</b> <b>configuration</b> involved placing a nuclear device (less than 20 kilotons) {{at the bottom of}} a shaft. A communications satellite or other experiment was placed in a partially evacuated test chamber simulating a space environment. The test chamber was parked at ground level at the top of the shaft. At zero time, the radiation from the device shot up the vertical pipe to the surface test chamber. Mechanical closures then intercepted and sealed the pipe, preventing the explosive shock wave from damaging the targets. The test chamber was immediately disconnected by remote control from the pipe and quickly winched to safety before the ground could subside to form a crater. The Huron King test cost US$10.3 million in 1980.|$|E

These test results will provide validation databases for interior noise prediction codes on realistic aircraft fuselage structures. The ATC is a 12 -ft-long, all-aluminum, scale model assembly.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} optimize {{the application of the}} multi-configuration DFT technique for analog circuits.

An optimized approach is proposed to apply this DFT technique in a more refined way. The optimization problem consists in choosing among the various permitted <b>test</b> <b>configurations,</b> a set that leads to the best testability/cost trade-off.

The main novel contribution {{of this paper is}} to extend the use of <b>test</b> <b>configurations</b> for diagnosis purposes and to propose a method for locating faults in the NoC interconnection infrastructure. Additionally, {{a new concept}} of functional switch faults, called link faults, is introduced.
