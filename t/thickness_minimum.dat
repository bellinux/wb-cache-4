5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of <b>thickness</b> <b>minimum.</b> Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E

The k-planar graphs with n vertices have at most O(k1/2n) edges, and treewidth O((kn)1/2). A shallow minor of a k-planar graph, with depth d, is itself a (2d + 1)k-planar graph, so the shallow minors of 1-planar graphs and of k-planar graphs are also sparse graphs, implying that the 1-planar and k-planar graphs have bounded expansion.|$|E

Testing was voluntarily terminated in February 2014, with the thruster accumulating 51, 184 hours of operation, processing 918 kg of xenon propellant, and delivering 35. 5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection objectives for the ion optics were derived from the original NEXT LDT test objectives, such as service life model validation, and expanded to encompass other goals that included verification of in situ measurements, test issue root causes, and past design changes. The ion optics cold grid gap had decreased only by an average of 7 % of pretest center grid gap, so efforts to stabilize NEXT grid gap were largely successful. The upstream screen grid surface exhibited a chamfered erosion pattern. Screen grid thicknesses were 86 % of the estimated pretest thickness, indicating that the screen grid has substantial service life remaining.

ESMH were fragmented as whole ESMH (before fractioning), Fraction I (> 10 kDa), Frac-tion II (3 - 10 kDa), and Fraction III (< 3 kDa). In order to test whether fractionated ESMH can be used for functional cosmetic materials, we examined not only the level of hyaluronic acid and collagen production, but also the MMP- 1 activity using a HaCaT and CCD- 986 Sk cell line. Our study treated each sample of fractionated ESMH with different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 1, 1 mg/mL). In our in vivo research, we used hairless mice that had been exposed to UV-B to induce wrinkles for 7 wk, then applied Fraction I to the treatment group for 5 wk and then tested skin <b>thickness,</b> <b>minimum</b> erythema dose and moisture content. In addition, Fraction I was high in collagen and HA biosynthesis and it was better than TGF-β in improv-ing of the skin. When TNF-α caused MMP- 1 activity in the CCD- 986 Sk cells, the whole ESMH and Fraction I proved to be effective in hindering the induction of collagenase depending on the concentration, and also showed outstanding effects in the suppression of skin aging. We found that the treatment group mice’s UV-B radiation-induced skin damage was largely mitigated compared to that of the non-treatment group mice. Thus, we have concluded that EMSH helps to mitigate UV-B radiation-induced wrinkles, collagen, HA, MMP- 1 activity and can be used for functional cosmetic materials.

40|$|AbstractInspection of {{corroded}} engineering components {{is vital}} for ensuring safety throughout the lifetime of infrastructure. However, full inspection can be infeasible due to time constraints, budgetary limits or restricted access. Subsequently there is growing interest in partial coverage inspection (PCI) techniques which use data from the inspection of a limited area to assess the condition of larger areas of a component. Extreme value analysis (EVA) is a tool for PCI, it allows an inspector to build a statistical model of the smallest thicknesses across a component. Construction of extreme value models relies on {{the selection of the}} smallest thicknesses from the inspection data. Current methodologies rely on the judgement of the analyst to select sets of <b>thickness</b> <b>minima</b> and frequently the inspection data is not checked to ensure that the assumptions made by EVA are reasonable. Consequently, the resulting models can be subjective and can provide inadequate models for extrapolation. In this paper, a framework for building extreme value models of inspection data is introduced.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate investigations of plankton models at different scales. In the first investigation the master equation for an individual-based model with pair interactions is formulated. Special cases of the master equation are used to explain the differences in behavior of the individual- based model and its mean-field approximation. In the second investigation constraints on the biomass and productivity of a continuum model for plankton are found using the large-scale properties of the model. The third investigation quantifies the hypothesis that thin layers of plankton and other passive tracers are created by vertically-sheared horizontal currents acting on horizontal property gradients. Chapter II contains {{the development of a}} master equation for a spatial population model for reproducing and interacting individuals. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the mean-field approximation to the individual-based model can grossly under- or over-estimate the population of the individual-based model, depending on the ratio of diffusive to reproductive time scales and the ratio of the growth rate to the interaction strength. The failure of the mean-field model is explained by applying the master equation to the special cases of no interactions and infinite-range interactions between individuals. Chapter III describes a continuum model for plankton growing, diffusing, and being stirred in an inhomogeneous environment. Bounds on the biomass and productivity are developed which allow the estimation of the plankton abundance without knowing the details of the flow or the spatially (and temporally) varying growth rate. Furthermore, a constrain is found that may forbid extinction, even when the average growth rate is negative. Chapter IV examines the situation of an initial patch of a passive tracer (such as plankton) being sheared into a thin vertical layer by a vertically-sheared horizontal current.

40|$|Strain coupled {{multi-layer}} {{quantum dot}} (QD) structures are limited {{due to their}} non-uniform dot size distribution, as-grown defects and dislocations. Even with these limitations, they are subject of interest because of high optical and device efficiency. In this work, we propose a modified growth strategy in which monolayer (ML) deposition of QDs is varied based on reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} (RHEED) pattern to achieve defect free structure with uniform dot size distribution. The overgrowth percentage, i. e. monolayer deposition above critical <b>thickness</b> (<b>minimum</b> thickness required for transition from two-dimensional (2 D) to three-dimensional (3 D) confined structures) was kept constant in modified strategy. To verify this claim, we have compared it with conventional strain coupled multilayer structure and demonstrated improved optical performance and device characteristics. Photoluminescence spectroscopy exhibited monomodal QD distribution in strain-coupled multi-stacked heterostructure grown by the proposed strategy. Power dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurement confirms existence of single ground state peak. The proposed strategy yielded a defect free structure and better carrier capture rate compared to conventional multilayer QDs. The spectral response observed from proposed quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) exhibited multiple peaks in mid-IR region (3. 92 mu m and 4. 54 mu m), {{which is one of the}} essential requirements for fabricating infrared detectors or focal plane arrays. Post-growth thermal annealing treatment at various temperatures (650 - 800 degrees C) were performed to verify the change in activation energy, ground-state emission peak, and thermal stability. Negligible change in the ground-state PL emission peak (< 2 %) and thermal activation energy (< 2 %) were observed up to 750 degrees C. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the ground-state peak of the annealed samples exhibited a similar trend. High-temperature thermal stability was achieved probably due to high strain field hindering material interdiffusion and improved quantum confinement realized from uniform QD sizes. The modified growth strategy used in this paper is helpful not only for improved optical characteristics, but also for useful device performances, such as a night vision camera in defense areas, cancer detector in medical applications and fabrication of thermal imagers; focal plane arrays...|$|E

Data were analysed from a longitudinal study of 179 cows, which had been examined at 5 assessment points - 8, + 1, + 9, + 17 and + 29 weeks relative to either their 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd or 4 th calving. At each assessment point, SST were measured using ultrasonography. Additional assessment point data included sole lesions and back fat thickness (BFT), and cows had been locomotion scored fortnightly from calving. 158 cows completed the study. Separate logistic regression survival analyses were constructed to assess the outcomes, either lameness on a leg or CHDL on a claw; combinations of lameness and lesions were tested as outcomes. Cow level variables tested included farm and lactation number. Variables were tested describing previous SST <b>thickness,</b> <b>minimum</b> previous SST thickness, BFT, and change in either variable between prior assessment points. Prior lesions/lameness strongly predicted repeat cases and the final models had the outcome first lesion or lameness on a claw or leg. In the reported lameness models, lameness was defined as a leg being recorded as lame twice within three consecutive scores, and in the reported lesion models, lesion was defined as the first presence of either a sole ulcer or a severe sole haemorrhage on a claw. Thin SST increased the likelihood of lesion occurrence; thin SST on 43 the lateral claw predicted subsequent lameness on a leg. Thin BFT and thinning of BFT between previous assessment points increased the likelihood of future lesion occurrence. Thin SST and thinning of BFT had additional effects on the likelihood of lesion occurrence, suggesting that BFT and sole SST had independent effects on lesion occurrence. However, change in SST thickness between assessment points did not influenced the likelihood of future lesions or lameness. This suggests that thin SST were not simply a result of depletion of body fat and challenges the theory that thinning of the digital cushion with body fat mobilization leads to CHDL. Other possible mechanisms by which SST become thin are discussed, and could include changes in integrity of the suspensory apparatus with physiological events...|$|E

Particular attention is paid in the present study to (a) the nature of chromitite layers and their host rocks, (b) the contrast between the mineral chemistry of weakly disseminated chromite and grains within massive ore layers, (c) concentrations of Cr, V, Ni, Co, Sc and Ti in orthopyroxene in relation to stratigraphic height, and levels of Sr, Ba and Zr associated with hypothetically pure, intercumulus plagioclase feldspar, and (d) possible mechanisms which induce crystallization of chromitite layers containing 50 per cent Cr₂ 0 ₃ from magma with a Cr content of less than 1 000 ppm. Electron microprobe studies of chromite in relation to mineralogical and textural environment clearly reveal that (a) the proportions of Cr and Al cations are linked to paragenesis: higher Al/Cr ratios characterize olivine-bearing domains, whereas grains intergrown with plagioclase feldspar exhibit low AI/Cr ratios, and (b) Al contents rise with a decline in Mg/(Mg + Fe²⁺) from high values to a value of 0, 450, then decrease with a further decline in Mg/(Mg + Fe²⁺). The paragenetically later trend is emphasized in a large population of chromite grains which escaped early encapsulation in orthopyroxene crystals and continued to grow in the environment of intercumulus plagioclase. Within-and between-sample compositional variation of grains in silicate-rich domains is modelled in terms of in situ growth increments, diffusive homogenization of zonal structures, and residence time within interstitial melt. Fractionation trends, as measured by Mg/(Mg + Fe²⁺) ratios in whole-rock and/or microprobe studies of orthopyroxene, are reversed in relation to stratigraphic height towards the top of the B unit and in the overlying C unit. These data are supported, for example, by lower vanadium contents and higher Ni/Sc ratios in hypothetically pure orthopyroxene. Small olivine crystals in chromite-rich domains are enriched in Ni relative to coarse-grained olivine in adjacent dunite: a feature attributed to early isolation of primocrysts from magma in the former case, and in situ equilibration between olivine crystals and Ni-depleted residual melt in the latter case. Similarly, rising Ni contents and Mg/(Mg + Fe²⁺) ratios of orthopyroxene with increasing stratigraphic height in the footwall of the LG 6 chromitite layer, linked to a progressive decline in orthopyroxene grain-size, are effects which may arise out of early separation of interstitial melt from orthopyroxene cumulates. A model is thus proposed which (a) links the thickness of chromitite layers to the vertical separation between successive layers or the thickness of fine-grained orthopyroxenite in the footwall, (b) ascribes copious nucleation of chromite to liquid mixing of this footwall derived, Cr - depleted contaminant with influxes of hot, primitive magma, and (c) tenders the notion that the present modal proportion of mesostasis in the footwall of a chromitite layer serves as a reciprocal measure of the volume of fractionated exudat...|$|E
