60|$|March 31.--Day {{varied by}} dining with Mr. Scrope, {{where we found}} Mr. Williams and Mr. Simson,[499] both {{excellent}} artists. We had not {{too much of the}} palette, but made a very agreeable day out. I contrived <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> the proof-sheets sent me this morning, so that I must have a revise. This frequent absence of mind becomes very exceeding troublesome. I have the distinct recollection of laying them carefully aside after I dressed to go to the Pavilion. Well, I have a head--the proverb is musty.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{conceive}} what possesses me, {{over every}} person besides, <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> papers. I {{received a letter}} Saturday at e'en, enclosing a bill for Â£750; no deaf nuts. Well, I read it, and note the contents; and this day, {{as if it had}} been a wind-bill in the literal sense of the words, I search everywhere, and lose three hours of my morning--turn over all my confusion in the writing-desk--break open one or two letters, lest I should have enclosed the sweet and quickly convertible document in them,--send for a joiner, and disorganise my scrutoire, lest it should have fallen aside by mistake. I find it at last--the place where is of little consequence; but this trick must be amended.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Huron {{took his}} hand off his {{tomahawk}} at this pacific rejoinder, made a bow not ungraciously, said he could not, of course, ask more than an apology from a gentleman of my age (Merci, monsieur!), and, hearing the name of Mr. Selwyn, made another bow to George, {{and said he had}} a letter to him from Lord March, which he had had the ill-fortune <b>to</b> <b>mislay.</b> George has put him up for the club, it appears, in conjunction with March, and no doubt these three lambs will fleece each other. Meanwhile, my pacified savage sate down with us, and buried the hatchet in another bowl of punch, for which these gentlemen must call. Heaven help us! 'Tis eleven o'clock, and here comes Bedson with my gruel! H. W.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{say such}} a thing!" [...] she returned. [...] "It makes one feel as if the {{foundations}} of the great deep were giving way. I don't know what that means exactly, but I suppose it's equivalent <b>to</b> <b>mislaying</b> George's hatchet and going back on the Declaration generally; and I don't like to hear you talk so." ...|$|R
6000|$|The strenuous {{experiences}} {{through which}} Mr. Lavender had passed resulted in what Joe Petty called [...] "a fair knock-out," [...] {{and he was}} forced to spend three days in the seclusion of his bed, deprived of his newspapers. He instructed Mrs. Petty, however, on no account <b>to</b> destroy or <b>mislay</b> any journal, but to keep them in a pile in his study. This she did, for though her first impulse was to light the kitchen fire with the five of them every morning, deliberate reflection convinced her that twenty journals read at one sitting would produce on him a more soporific effect than if he came down to a mere five.|$|R
6000|$|Elaine Youghal sat {{at lunch}} in the Speise Saal of one of Vienna's costlier hotels. The double-headed eagle, with its [...] "K.u.K." [...] legend, {{everywhere}} met the eye and announced the imperial favour in which the establishment basked. Some several square yards of yellow bunting, charged {{with the image of}} another double-headed eagle, floating from the highest flag-staff above the building, betrayed to the initiated the fact that a Russian Grand Duke was concealed somewhere on the premises. Unannounced by heraldic symbolism but unconcealable by reason of nature's own blazonry, were several citizens and citizenesses of the great republic of the Western world. One or two Cobdenite members of the British Parliament engaged in the useful task of proving that the cost of living in Vienna was on an exorbitant scale, flitted with restrained importance through a land whose fatness they had come to spy out; every fancied over-charge in their bills was welcome as providing another nail in the coffin of their fiscal opponents. It is the glory of democracies that they may be misled but never driven. Here and there, like brave deeds in a dust-patterned world, flashed and glittered the sumptuous uniforms of representatives of the Austrian military caste. Also in evidence, at discreet intervals, were stray units of the Semetic tribe that nineteen centuries of European neglect had been unable <b>to</b> <b>mislay.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is 1814, {{it is the}} 16th of March, Shelley {{has written}} his letter, {{he has been in}} the Boinville paradise a month, his deserted wife is in her husbandless home. Mischief had been wrought. It is the biographer who concedes this. We greatly need some light on Harriet's side of the case now; we need to know how she enjoyed the month, but {{there is no way to}} inform ourselves; there seems to be a strange absence of {{documents}} and letters and diaries on that side. Shelley kept a diary, the approaching Mary Godwin kept a diary, her father kept one, her half-sister by marriage, adoption, and the dispensation of God kept one, and the entire tribe and all its friends wrote and received letters, and the letters were kept and are producible when this biography needs them; but there are only three or four scraps of Harriet's writing, and no diary. Harriet wrote plenty of letters to her husband--nobody knows where they are, I suppose; she wrote plenty of letters to other people--apparently they have disappeared, too. Peacock says she wrote good letters, but apparently interested people had sagacity enough <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> them in time. After all her industry she went down into her grave and lies silent there--silent, when she has so much need to speak. We can only wonder at this mystery, not account for it.|$|E
60|$|Sebastopol is {{probably}} the worst battered town in Russia or any where else. But {{we ought to be}} pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have been in no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where we felt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports. The moment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately dispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any assistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home in Sebastopol! If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch of hospitality. They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry them excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a complicated passport system. Had we come from any other country we could not have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under three days--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where we pleased. Every body in Constantinople warned us {{to be very careful about}} our passports, see that they were strictly 'en regle', and never <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances of Englishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in Sebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, and for which they were not to blame. I had lost my passport, and was traveling under my room-mate's, who stayed behind in Constantinople to await our return. To read the description of him in that passport and then look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I am like Hercules. So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear and trembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to be found out and hanged. But all that time my true passport had been floating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag. They never asked us for any other.|$|E
60|$|Had your father, young folks, {{possessed the}} commonest share of prudence, {{not only would}} this chapter of his history never have been written, but you yourselves would never have {{appeared}} in the world to plague him in a hundred ways to shout and laugh in the passages when he wants to be quiet at his books; to wake him when he is dozing after dinner, as a healthy country gentleman should: <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> his spectacles for him, and steal away his newspaper when he wants to read it; to ruin him with tailors' bills, mantua-makers' bills, tutors' bills, as you all of you do: to break his rest of nights when you have the impudence to fall ill, and when he would sleep undisturbed but that your silly mother will never be quiet for half an hour; and when Joan can't sleep, what use, pray, is there in Darby putting on his nightcap? Every trifling ailment that any one of you has had, has scared her so that I protest I have never been tranquil; and, were I not the most long-suffering creature in the world, would have liked to be rid of the whole pack of you. And now, forsooth, that you have grown out of childhood, long petticoats, chicken-pox, small-pox, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, and the other delectable accidents of puerile life, what must that unconscionable woman propose but to arrange the south rooms as a nursery for possible grandchildren, and set up the Captain with a wife, and make him marry early because we did! He is too fond, she says, of Brookes's and Goosetree's when he is in London. She has the perversity to hint that, though an entree to Carlton House may be very pleasant, 'tis very dangerous for a young gentleman: and she would have Miles live away from temptation, and sow his wild oats, and marry, as we did. Marry! my dear creature, we had no business to marry at all! By the laws of common prudence and duty, I ought to have backed out of my little engagement with Miss Theo (who would have married somebody else), and taken a rich wife. Your Uncle John was a parson and couldn't fight, poor Charley was a boy at school, and your grandfather was too old a man to call me to account with sword and pistol. I repeat there never was a more foolish match in the world than ours, and our relations were perfectly right in being angry with us. What are relations made for, indeed, but to be angry and find fault? When Hester marries, do you mind, Master George, to quarrel with her if she does not take a husband of your selecting. When George has got his living, after being senior wrangler and fellow of his college, Miss Hester, do you toss up your little nose at the young lady he shall fancy. As for you, my little Theo, I can't part with your. You must not quit your old father; for he likes you to play Haydn to him, and peel his walnuts after dinner.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Tipper {{signed up for the}} Marine Corps, but was {{rejected}} because his teeth could not bite together. He therefore volunteered for the paratroopers, and was sent to Toccoa, Georgia and was assigned to Easy Company for training under Captain Herbert Sobel. During the training in Camp Mackall, Tipper was made Sobel's runner; with his help, [...] "Sobel was able <b>to</b> <b>mislay</b> his maps, compass, and other items when he most needed them." [...] Tipper received further training with Easy Company in Aldbourne, United Kingdom. Tipper made his first combat jump into Normandy on D-Day, where he met with fellow Easy Company member Frank Mellet and some other paratroopers and engaged in a firefight with a German patrol. Later, the men and other paratroopers attacked the Marmion Farm. The soldiers held the farm before joining their own units.|$|E
