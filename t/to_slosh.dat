500|$|Another memorable {{race that}} year for Prost {{was at the}} San Marino Grand Prix. He was {{cruising}} to victory when his car began {{to run out of}} fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth <b>to</b> <b>slosh</b> the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself [...] "shit, I am going to lose this race again", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the thermodynamic response enhanced by sloshing inside liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel tanks. An existing numerical solver provided by OpenFOAM is used <b>to</b> simulate <b>sloshing</b> in a model scaled tank of similar form to an LNG fuel tank. The interface area has been estimated for different sloshing regimes on three different numerical grids representing the tank in 3 D. Estimating the interface area is done by performing a grid-independence study. In the most severe sloshing conditions, convergence is not achieved. By combining the results from experiments and CFD, {{it is found that}} the interface area and the condensation mass flow rate are in phase for the most severe sloshing condition. The existing CFD solver is modified to determine the pressure drop. The simulation results are compared to the experimental data, and the results are acceptable and thereby show a potential in applying CFD to predict the thermodynamic response due <b>to</b> <b>sloshing.</b> By plotting the temperature contours, indications are found that the exchange of cold bulk and saturated liquid due <b>to</b> <b>sloshing</b> has a significant influence on the thermodynamic response...|$|R

Numerical results show good correlation with the experimental results. The consequences of the large impact pressure observed at the low filling level are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{the use of the}} two {{different}} membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic membrane tanks utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the Suez Canal. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance <b>to</b> <b>sloshing</b> forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.|$|R

50|$|This concept utilises an {{axial flow}} pump to force the water {{from one side of}} the ship to other rather than {{allowing}} it <b>to</b> <b>slosh</b> as in passive systems. Webster (1967) studied the design of such a tank in detail. The main disadvantage to this is that when the pump is operated there is a time lag for a sizeable amount of fluid to arrive at a tank, thus limiting instant roll stabilization. Hence, compared to fin stabiliser systems, this is highly inefficient.|$|E

50|$|Ferrofluids enable an {{interesting}} opportunity to harvest vibration {{energy from the}} environment. Existing methods of harvesting low frequency (<100 Hz) vibrations {{require the use of}} solid resonant structures. With ferrofluids, energy harvester designs no longer need solid structure. One example of ferrofluid based energy harvesting is discussed in the journal article, Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester. First a ferrofluid is placed inside a container that is wrapped with a coil of wire. The ferrofluid is then externally magnetized using a permanent magnet. When external vibrations cause the ferrofluid <b>to</b> <b>slosh</b> around in the container, there is a change in magnetic flux fields with respect to the coil of wire. Through Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, voltage is induced in the coil of wire due to change in magnetic flux.|$|E
5000|$|A single {{partially}} filled {{tank that}} extends across the full {{breadth of the}} vessel.

This type of tank was first investigated by William Froude, but did not receive much attention until the 1950s when it was revived and used in many naval vessels. They have the added advantage {{that it is possible to}} vary tank natural frequency by changes in water level and thus accommodate changes in ships metacentric height.

40|$|Aims. We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a radio minihalo in RXCJ 1504. 1 - 0248, a massive galaxy cluster that has an extremely luminous cool core. To date, only 9 radio minihalos are known, thus {{the discovery of}} a new one, {{in one of the most}} luminous cool-core clusters, provides important information on this peculiar class of sources and sheds light on their origin. Methods. The diffuse radio source is detected using GMRT at 327 MHz and confirmed by pointed VLA data at 1. 46 GHz. The minihalo has a radius of ∼ 140 kpc. A Chandra gas temperature map shows that the minihalo emission fills the cluster cool core and has some morphological similarities to it, as has been previously observed for other minihalos. Results. The Chandra data reveal two subtle cold fronts in the cool core, likely created by sloshing of the core gas, as observed in most cool-core clusters. Following previous work, we speculate that the origin of the minihalo is related <b>to</b> <b>sloshing.</b> Sloshing may result in particle acceleration by generating turbulence and/or amplifying the magnetic field in the cool core, leading to the formation of a minihalo.

40|$|With {{significant}} decrease in the background noise in present day automobiles, liquid slosh noise from an automotive fuel tank is considered as a great irritant during acceleration and deceleration. All major international OEMs and their suppliers try <b>to</b> reduce <b>sloshing</b> noise by various design modifications in the fuel tank. However, most major activities reported in open literature are primarily based on performing various CAE and experimental studies in isolation. At the same time, noise generation and its propagation is a multiphysics phenomenon, where uid mechanics due <b>to</b> liquid <b>sloshing</b> affects structural behaviour of the fuel tank and its mountings which in turn affects noise generation and propagation. In the present study, a multiphysics approach to noise generation has been used <b>to</b> predict liquid <b>sloshing</b> noise from a rectangular tank.

50|$|Another {{approach}} is to use nuclear transitions driven by collective electron oscillations. The scheme would employ a triad of isomeric states: a long-lived storage state, {{in addition to an}} upper and lower lasing state. The storage state would be energetically close to the short-lived upper lasing state but separated by a forbidden transition involving one quantum unit of spin angular momentum. The graser would be enabled by a very intense optical laser <b>to</b> <b>slosh</b> the electron cloud back and forth and saturate the forbidden transition in the near field of the cloud. The population of the storage state would then be quickly equalized with the upper lasing state whose transition to the lower lasing state would be both spontaneous and stimulated by resonant gamma radiation. A “complete” chart of nuclides likely contains {{a very large number of}} isomeric states, and the existence of such a triad seems likely, but it has yet to be found.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wet sump}} design can be {{problematic}} in a racing car, as the large g force pulled by drivers going around corners causes {{the oil in}} the pan <b>to</b> <b>slosh,</b> gravitating away from the oil pick-up, briefly starving the system of oil and damaging the engine. However, on a motorcycle this difficulty does not arise, as a bike leans into corners and the oil is not displaced sideways. Nevertheless, racing motorcycles usually benefit from dry sump lubrication, as this allows the engine to be mounted lower in the frame; and a remote oil tank can permit better lubricant cooling. [...] Early stationary engines employed a small scoop on the extremity of the crankshaft or connecting rod {{to assist with the}} lubrication of the cylinder walls by means of a splashing action.
