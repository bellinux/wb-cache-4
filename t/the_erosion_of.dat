5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|As the {{industrialisation}} of {{the valleys}} began {{there was little}} shift {{in the use of}} Welsh as a first language.

The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity. In 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E
40|$|Cavitation erosion causes serious {{problems}} for hydraulic machinery. Selective laser melting (SLM), {{is a type}} of additive manufacturing that can produce metal parts directly and it has begun to be used in various industrial settings. However, <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLM processed parts have only rarely been reported. The paper addresses <b>the</b> cavitation <b>erosion</b> behavior <b>of</b> AlSi 10 Mg samples fabricated by SLM at different laser scanning speeds. A wrought sample was also tested to provide a basis for comparison. Sample hardness and microstructure were investigated. Results showed <b>the</b> cavitation <b>erosion</b> behaviors <b>of</b> SLM samples to differ greatly from that of the wrought sample. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> rate <b>of</b> SLM samples was found to peak in the first 30 s. This was accompanied by the removal of particles inside pores. After peaking, <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLM samples decreased significantly. SLM samples showed an extremely low <b>erosion</b> rate entering <b>the</b> steady-state period. Large, deep craters which were common wear marks on the wrought sample, were not present on the SLM samples. Different scanning speeds resulted in different max erosion rates...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface {{coatings}} of reed switches considering different physicochemical processes occurring on the contact surfaces {{and inside the}} inter-electrode gap was proposed. According to that, the discrete electron avalanche (ecton) introduced in the explosive electron emission theory by Mesyats is considered as the main motive force responsible for the surface modification and mass transfer of materials {{in the course of}} breaking/shorting of the contacts. By means of SEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the contact surfaces after various numbers of switching cycles, the energy threshold of the ecton generation defining <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coatings was found to be proportional to the specific sublimation and ionization energies of coating materials. It has been shown that <b>the</b> total <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coatings on the working surface of the contacts after the commutation test possess the resultant character; i. e., <b>the</b> specificities <b>of</b> <b>erosion</b> occurring after each commutation event are characteristic for the whole of the commutation test. In further development of our model, we suggested that a few monolayers of metals (or alloys) with low ionization potential deposited on the main coatings can improve <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> stability <b>of</b> contacts...|$|R

5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> wear {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> SiC particles {{reinforced steel}} matrix surface composite were studied by self-made slurry erosion wear test apparatus with quartz slurries, and contrasted {{with that of}} plain carbon steel, high chromium cast iron and low chromium cast iron. The results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> wear rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four tested materials has the different changes {{not only with the}} quartz particles sizes in slurry, but also with <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> angle <b>of</b> slurry. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> wear rate <b>of</b> SiC particle reinforced steel matrix surface composite is the lowest in four kinds of tested materials under the test conditions. And that of high chromium cast iron is less than that of low chromium cast iron under the same test conditions. The SiC particles embedded the steel matrix could prevent the steel surface from wear brought by quartz particles in slurry erosion wear, and protect the steel matrix, so that <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> wear resistance <b>of</b> steel matrix could be increased...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{cavitation}} erosion tests {{were carried out}} by using thermal spraying and deposition of Ti-Ni shape memory alloy for the surface coating. The results show the test speciment of Ti-Ni thermal spraying has many initial defects, so that <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> resistance is very low. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> resistance <b>of</b> Ti-Ni deposit is about 5 - 10 times {{higher than that of}} SUS 304, thus <b>erosion</b> resistance <b>of</b> Ti-Ni deposit is better than that of Ti-Ni thermal spraying. <b>The</b> cavitation <b>erosion</b> tests were carried out by using Fe-Mn-Si with shape memory and gummetal with low elastic modulus. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> resistance <b>of</b> Fe-Mn-Si shape memory alloy solid is about 9 times higher than that <b>of</b> SUS 304. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> resistance <b>of</b> gummetal is almost the same as SUS 304, because the test specimen of gummetal has many small defects on the original surface...|$|R

5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the European as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E
5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E

5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist {{of a series of}} sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E
