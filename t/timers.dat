5|$|Fuel {{was carried}} in 14 bag tanks, {{four in the}} centre {{fuselage}} above and {{to the rear of}} the nosewheel bay and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric <b>timers</b> which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|E
5|$|Enemy monsters {{inhabit the}} levels, but the player can crush them by {{flattening}} impassable blocks against them. The player may also encounter <b>timers</b> {{in the form}} of alarm clocks that will begin to elapse when crushed {{for the first time and}} can only be stopped when Danny jumps on them. Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E

50|$|Many {{video games}} use {{a time limit}} feature, with console systems ranging from the Intellivision to the PlayStation 4. A time limit can have several aliases {{associated}} with it: countdown <b>timer</b> (used mostly for continues), race <b>timer</b> (appearing in various racing games to show how much time the player has raced around the track), minigame <b>timer</b> (appearing in various minigames), round <b>timer</b> (appearing in fighting games), mission <b>timer</b> (used in action games where players have to escape from a fatal situation), sports <b>timer</b> (appears in sports games like basketball and American football), and pre-race countdown <b>timer</b> (appears in most racing games to signal {{the start of the}} race).|$|R
5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, <b>timers</b> and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored <b>timers</b> on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
5|$|Following Shooting Accuracy, {{both teams}} {{participated in the}} Skills Challenge Relay. Each team broke into two groups and went {{through a series of}} drills {{designed}} to showcase players' skills. It started with one <b>timers,</b> then proceeded to passing, where a single player had to complete a pass into six small nets. From there it went to the Puck Control Relay, having a participant skate through a series of cones with a puck. Another player then took on the Stick Handling drill, controlling a puck through a series of stationary pucks. The relay ended when a final player completed the Shooting Accuracy, again hitting all four targets. The two groups from Team Lidstrom finished first and third in the competition, gaining their team a total of five points. During the Hardest Shot competition reigning champion Zdeno Chara was defeated in his preliminary round match up by Shea Weber. In the final round, Chara again matched up with Weber. Chara successfully defended his title by defeating Weber with a shot registering 105.9mph. The speed set a new SuperSkills record surpassing his own record and marking the fourth time he has won the event. Despite being down by a large margin prior to the Elimination Shootout, Team Lidstrom still had an opportunity to win the contest. Players continued to shoot provided they scored – scoring one point per goal, until only one player remained. However, the shoot-out was won by Team Staal's Corey Perry as he was the only player to score in all three of his attempts. The full results are listed below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Based on {{the fact}} {{that a large number of}} timing {{controllers}} are needed in the applications like sequential logic control and programmable controller, this paper proposed a PLC <b>timer</b> system based on ARM+FPGA, in which ARM is used to execute user program while FPGA is used for <b>timer</b> operation in parallel. The FPGA <b>timer</b> module consists of <b>timer</b> controller, <b>timer</b> dynamic parameters and soft contact state register, the <b>timer</b> controller carries out counter operation for timing unit every 1 ms, then results from timing operation would be saved in <b>timer</b> parameter list of a dual port RAM, when controller commands need to be executed via PLC, the <b>timer</b> will be used as a regular memory unit for W/R operation, thus no executing time of PLC program would be spared basically, which can well meet the system requirements where large number of controllers are needed. Simultaneously, principles of system composition, timing operation control and timing operation flow are all introduced followed by which a field test is also carried out for testament of the designed <b>timer</b> system...|$|R
