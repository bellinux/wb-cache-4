5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic—which {{took place}} with <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> the fourth {{to the third}} {{millennium}} BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change {{in the style of}} monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, {{with the exception of the}} island's south-eastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.|$|E

5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> the lute song to the continuo song was complete.

That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
