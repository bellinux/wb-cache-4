It is the only wooden temple with gabled roof (single storied) in Chamba, while all others in the town are built from stone in the north Indian Nagara architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Just {{past the}} county line in Oneida Castle, NY5 intersects NY365, a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona. NY5 presses on, {{passing through the}} city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon (briefly {{overlapping}} NY31) {{and the town of}} Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland, where NY5 intersects NY233, crosses over Oriskany Creek, and meets the western terminus of NY5B. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> NY5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY5A departs NY5 to serve western Utica. NY5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford, meeting NY12B prior to merging with NY12 at Genesee Street. Both routes continue eastward across the Sauquoit Creek into Utica.|$|E
5|$|Tim is {{kicked off}} the team after missing a week of {{practice}} when he leaves on <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the moment to go with Jason Street to Mexico {{to look for a}} treatment for Jason's paralysis. On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman, with whom he had a brief affair, is now seeing his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding another place to live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment.|$|E

5|$|Harlech Castle rests upon <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> rock {{called the}} Harlech Dome; the land falls away sharply {{on the north}} and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the {{remaining}} approaches to the castle. The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an orthopedic surgery resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand with plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas on <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Route 4 was {{originally}} legislated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering {{to run from}} Cape May north to the George Washington Bridge, running through Pleasantville, Toms River, Freehold, Perth Amboy, Rahway, and Paterson. The route replaced portions of the alignments of several pre-1927 state highways including pre-1927 Route 14 between Cape May and Seaville, pre-1927 Route 19 between Seaville and Absecon, pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and between South Amboy and Rahway, a spur of pre-1927 Route 7 between Lakewood and Freehold. The rest of the proposed route was to be built on a new alignment. Of the pre-1927 state highways that Route 4 was to follow, pre-1927 Route 14 {{was originally}} legislated in 1917, pre-1927 Route 19 was legislated in 1923 but never built, pre-1927 Route 4 was created in 1916, and <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> pre-1927 Route 7 was created in 1925. U.S. Route 9 was also designated along Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and from South Amboy to Rahway. By the 1940s, U.S. Route 9 was realigned to follow Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy, having followed portions of today’s Route 88, Route 35, and Route 71 and was extended south along Route 4 to Cape May. The section of present-day Route 4 was built between 1930 and 1934 to connect Paterson and the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. There were plans made in 1936 to make this portion of Route 4 a limited-access road; however, World War II delayed plans for the expressway.|$|E

25|$|South of Brockweir {{the river}} makes a {{considerable}} westward loop, and a railway alignment directly serving Tintern {{would have been}} challenging.

Others including Citrine, who chaired the meeting, wrote that Churchill did not make such a speech. Later that night, Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast, and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it.|$|E

Speakers included former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and Hilary A. Herbert. On <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the moment, Herbert asked Corporal James R. Tanner, former Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic (a veterans organization for Union soldiers) to briefly address the crowd. Tanner lost both legs in the war, became a stenographer, and took eyewitness testimony {{on behalf of the}} government in the hours following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He had briefly led the Bureau of Pensions in 1889, and helped organize the American Red Cross. Nonetheless, there were murmurs of disapproval from the audience when Tanner spoke.|$|E
25|$|The Abdication crisis became public, {{coming to}} a head {{in the first two}} weeks of December 1936. At this time, Churchill {{publicly}} gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3 December. Churchill was a major speaker and later wrote that in replying to the Vote of Thanks, he made a declaration 'on <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the moment' asking for delay before any decision was made by either the King or his Cabinet. Later that night Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it. On 4 December, he met with the King and again urged delay in any decision about abdication. On 5 December, he issued a lengthy statement implying that the Ministry was applying unconstitutional pressure on the King to force him to make a hasty decision. On 7 December, he tried to address the Commons to plead for delay. He was shouted down. Seemingly staggered by the unanimous hostility of all Members, he left.|$|E
25|$|Ceaușescu was {{prepared}} {{to take a more}} decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society, which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceaușescu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the Prague Spring by Leonid Brezhnev. After a visit from Charles de Gaulle earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceaușescu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the Patriotic Guards created on <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> <b>of</b> the moment, {{in order to meet the}} perceived threat. President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a Socialist country after the start of the Cold War.|$|E
