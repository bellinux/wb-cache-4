NF-κB activation was successfully monitored in real time in endothelial cells in response to tumor angiogenic signaling, as well as in monocytes in response to inflammation. Further, we demonstrated dual blood monitoring of both NF-κB activation during tumor development as correlated to tumor formation using the NF-κB Gluc reporter, as well as the secreted alkaline phosphatase <b>reporter.</b> <b>This</b> NF-κB <b>reporter</b> system provides a powerful tool for monitoring NF-κB activity in real time in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
