40|$|Pose {{estimation}} of two-pose 3 D models using the base <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> and stability constraints A pose estimation technique {{is presented to}} determine coarse registration parameters between two 3 D models of an object. The models are reconstructed by merging multi-view range images of two different poses of the object, which is arbitrarily placed on a turntable. The result of pose estimation will facilitate registration refinement and integration of two 3 D models. Registration refinement of two 3 D models usually requires a rough estimate of pose between them. However, obtaining such estimate is a difficult problem and computationally expensive. We introduce a simple pose estimation technique based on matching <b>tangent</b> <b>planes</b> of a 3 D model with the base <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> (BTP) which is invariant for a vision system.

The elimination of this chatter provides a significant improvementinconvergence behavior, which is illustrated byanumber of numerical examples. Furthermore, smoothed surfaces also provide a more accurate representation of the actual surface, such that resulting stresses and forces can be more accurately computed with coarse meshes in many problems.

Our new method avoids unwanted undulations by relaxing the constraint of the first derivatives at the input mesh vertices: the tangent directions of the boundary curves at the mesh vertices are now completely free.
