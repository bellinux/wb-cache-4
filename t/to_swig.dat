In the mid-1970s Swig met Rabbi David Davis who, {{in conjunction with the}} Reverend John H. Elliott, a Lutheran minister and USF Theology & Religious studies professor, had recently begun to teach a class called “Jesus the Jew” at the University of San Francisco. Swig, who was Jewish, was intrigued {{with the idea of a}} Jewish perspective being taught at a Catholic university, and he suggested that Rabbi Davis introduce him to Father John Lo Schiavo, the president of the university. The three men explored the idea of creating a Jewish studies program at USF. As a result of their collaboration, in 1977 the Mae and Benjamin Swig Chair in Judaic Studies was established as an homage <b>to</b> <b>Swig's</b> parents. The program was the first Jewish Studies program at a Catholic university worldwide. Swig later became the chairman of the University of San Francisco Board of Trustees.|$|R

While SWIG is similar to other Perl extension building tools such as xsubpp and h 2 xs, SWIG has a number of unique features that help simplify the task of creating Perl extension modules. Many of these features are described as well as limitations and future directions. This paper is primarily intended for developers who are interested in combining Perl with applications written in C or C++ as well as current SWIG users who are interested in learning more about some of SWIG's advanced features...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. occam-pi is a {{programming}} language based on the CSP process algebra and the pi-calculus, and has a powerful syntax for expressing concurrency. occam-pi does not however, come with interfaces to {{a broad range of}} standard libraries (such as those used for graphics or mathematics). Programmers wishing to use these must write their own wrappers using occam-pi?s foreign function interface, which can be tedious and time consuming. SWIG offers automatic generation of wrappers for libraries written in C and C++, allowing access to these for the target languages supported by SWIG. This paper describes the occam-pi module for SWIG, which will allow automatic wrapper generation for occam-pi, and will ensure that occam-pi?s library base can be grown in a quick and efficient manner.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{graphical}} theory unifying causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and potential (aka counter-factual) outcomes via a node-splitting transformation. We {{introduce a new}} graph, the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a specific hypothetical intervention {{on the set of}} treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the correspond-ing counterfactual random variables. We illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Our graphical theory of SWIGs may be used to infer the coun-terfactual independence relations that hold among the SWIG variables under the FFRCISTG model of Robins (1986) and the NPSEM model with Indepen-dent Errors of Pearl (2000, 2009). Fur-thermore, in the absence of hidden vari-ables, the joint distribution of the coun-terfactuals is identified; the identifying formula is the extended g-computation formula introduced in (Robins et al., 2004).

Interfaces for each component in combination with the use of shared libraries for their implementation provides an easy integration of existing libraries into modern scripting languages thus allowing for rapid application development. This integration is simplified even further using a specialised toolkit (<b>SWIG)</b> <b>to</b> create ”shadow classes ” for the Python language, which map the definitions of the Abstract Interfaces almost at a one-to-one level. This paper will give an overview of the architecture and design choices and will present the current status and future developments of the project...|$|R

Sid has been divorced at least once (episode 304, [...] "Hung Out to Dry") and celebrated by getting incredibly drunk and falling down a flight of stairs, though he claims he [...] "didn't feel a thing". In episode 418, [...] "Admissions," [...] he mentions to Mac that he occasionally holds a curiosity for {{what it would be like}} <b>to</b> take a <b>swig</b> of hydrofluoric acid. When Mac jokingly responds that he himself wonders about doing a live autopsy on himself, Sid genuinely agrees before realizing, slightly crestfallen, that Mac is messing with him. In episode 419, [...] "Personal Foul," [...] he mentions that he enjoys fencing, and in episode 519, [...] "Communication Breakdown", it is shown that he understands and speaks at least some very small degree of Lithuanian. His level of fluency is unknown.|$|R
40|$|In this {{database}} {{we present}} and analyze a global database of soil infiltration measurements, Soil Water Infiltration Global (SWIG) database, {{for the first}} time. In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists who performed the experiments or they were digitized from published articles. Data from 54 different countries {{were included in the}} database with major contributions from Iran, China, and USA. In addition to its global spatial coverage, the collected infiltration curves cover a time span of research from 1976 to late 2017. In addition to infiltration data, basic information of the measurement location, the measurement method, soil properties, and land use were collected, which makes the database valuable for the development of pedo-transfer functions for estimating soil hydraulic properties, for the evaluation of infiltration measurement methods and for developing and validating infiltration models. Soil textural information (clay, silt, and sand content) is available for 3842 out of 5023 infiltration measurements (~ 76 %) covering nearly all soil USDA textural classes except for the sandy clay and silt classes. Information on the land use is available for 76 % of experimental sites with agricultural land use as the dominant type (~ 40 %). We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parametrization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models. All collected data and related soil characteristics are provided online in *. xlsx and *. csv formats for reference, and we add a disclaimer that the database is for use by public domain only and can be copied freely by referencing it. Data quality assessment is strongly advised prior to any use of this database. New data are welcomed <b>to</b> extend/update <b>SWIG...</b>|$|R
40|$|Statistical n-gram {{language}} modeling is a {{very important}} technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics used to assess the fluency of an utterance in any given language. It is widely employed in several important NLP applications such as Machine Translation and Automatic Speech Recognition. However, the most commonly used toolkit (SRILM) to build such language models on a large scale is written entirely in C++ which presents a challenge to an NLP developer or researcher whose primary language of choice is Python. This article first provides a gentle introduction to statistical language modeling. It then describes how to build a native and efficient Python interface (using <b>SWIG)</b> <b>to</b> the SRILM toolkit such that language models can be queried and used directly in Python code. Finally, it also demonstrates an effective use case of this interface by showing how to leverage it to build a Python language model server. Such a server can prove to be extremely useful when the language model needs to be queried by multiple clients over a network: the language model must only be loaded into memory once by the server and can then satisfy multiple requests. This article includes only those listings of source code that are most salient. To conserve space, some are only presented in excerpted form. The complete set of full source code listings may be found in (Madnani, 2009), the source code manuscript accompanying this primary manuscript. ...|$|R

5000|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was <b>to</b> take a <b>swig</b> of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.The entire episode was shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed frequently during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were in the community of Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|R
