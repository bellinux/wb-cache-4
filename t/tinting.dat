5|$|Typhoon Tingting was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that produced record-breaking rains in Guam. The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season, Tingting originated from a tropical depression over the open {{waters of the}} western Pacific Ocean. The storm gradually intensified as it traveled northwest, becoming a typhoon on June28 and reaching its peak the following day while passing through the Mariana Islands. After maintaining typhoon intensity for three days, a combination of dry air and cooler sea surface temperatures caused the storm to weaken as it traveled northward. On July1, the storm passed by the Bonin Islands, {{off the coast of}} Japan, before moving out to sea. By July4, <b>Tinting</b> had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants were last reported by the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, near the international date line on July13.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for <b>tinting</b> and shading in early photography.|$|E

25|$|In both geometries, the {{additive}} {{primary and}} secondary colors—red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta—and linear mixtures between adjacent pairs of them, sometimes called pure colors, are arranged around the outside edge of the cylinder with saturation 1. These saturated colors have lightness ½ in HSL, while in HSV they have value 1. Mixing these pure colors with black—producing so-called shades—leaves saturation unchanged. In HSL, saturation is also unchanged by <b>tinting</b> with white, and only mixtures with both black and white—called tones—have saturation less than 1. In HSV, <b>tinting</b> alone reduces saturation.|$|E
25|$|Ochre is a clay that is {{colored by}} varying amounts of hematite, varying between 20% and 70%. Red ochre {{contains}} unhydrated hematite, whereas yellow ochre contains hydrated hematite (Fe2O3 • H2O). The principal use of ochre is for <b>tinting</b> {{with a permanent}} color.|$|E

25|$|Poppyseed oil {{has been}} used for {{painting}} for at least 1500 years—one of the oldest known oil paintings, found in caves of Afghanistan and dated to AD 650, was likely drawn using poppyseed oil. It is most often found in white paints, and as a varnish. Painters prepared poppyseed oil by hand until the late 19th century, when oil paints became available prepared in tubes. While poppyseed oil does not cause as much yellowish <b>tinting</b> of paints as linseed oil, it dries slower and is less durable than linseed oil because the fat responsible for the yellowing also provides durability. Perilla oil, which causes yellow <b>tinting</b> even more than linseed, is even more durable than linseed.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis was {{restored}} and released on laserdisc in 1993 and in DVD format in 2005. The restoration was created through a high definition scan of a restored negative and the <b>tinting</b> was recreated using an abbreviated version from The National Film Center in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{atmospheric}} diffraction or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of particulate dust trapped {{primarily in the}} middle layers of the troposphere. This effect differs from water based atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is opaque whereas water allows light to pass through it. This {{has the effect of}} <b>tinting</b> the light the color of the dust particles. This <b>tinting</b> can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a magnifier instead of creating a distinct halo. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The effect is to make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Spiders, {{like most}} arthropods, {{have an open}} circulatory system, i.e., {{they do not have}} true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses {{surrounding}} their internal organs. The haemolymph contains hemocyanin, a respiratory protein similar in function to hemoglobin. Hemocyanin contains two copper atoms, <b>tinting</b> the haemolymph with a faint blue color.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{the year}} of the film's centenary, Photoplay Productions' Patrick Stanbury, in {{conjunction}} with the British Film Institute, carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new 4K scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It, too, was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original <b>tinting</b> {{for the first time since}} its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set by the BFI, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War related films from the period.|$|E
25|$|The two {{children}} who modelled {{for the cover}} were siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates. The photo shoot was a frustrating affair {{over the course of}} ten days. Shooting was done {{first thing in the morning}} and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the {{two children}} were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results of the shoot were less than satisfactory, but some accidental <b>tinting</b> effects in post-production created an unexpectedly striking album cover. The inner sleeve photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway.|$|E
30|$|Compared to {{photocatalyst}} <b>TiNT</b> itself, {{performance of}} immobilized <b>TiNT</b> was relatively lower. This might happen because of fewer contact between <b>TiNT</b> catalyst and phenol pollutant for the immobilized catalyst case, compared to catalyst in slurry condition. On the performance test, immobilized <b>TiNT</b> were only {{concentrated on the}} top part of test solution, due to floating ability of pumice. On the other hand, for the performance test of <b>TiNT,</b> the condition was slurry, where contact frequency between catalyst and pollutant was relatively high.|$|R

30|$|<b>TiNTs</b> were {{synthesised}} by hydrothermal treatment. The {{details of}} the synthesis method of <b>TiNTs</b> are described elsewhere [30]. A thin PDA layer was created {{onto the surface of}} <b>TiNTs</b> by oxidative polymerisation of dopamine-hydrochloride. This procedure involves mixing of 800  ml of <b>TiNT</b> suspension (2  mg/ml) with 1.6  g of dopamine-hydrochloride dissolved in 5  g of TRIS buffer adjusted to pH[*]=[*] 8.5. The PDA coating on <b>TiNTs</b> was carried out for 3.5  h at 25  °C. After coating, the pH was adjusted to 6.4 using 35 wt.% HCl. The suspension was purified using dialysis tubing cellulose membrane and the resulting PDA-functionalised <b>TiNTs</b> (PDA-TiNTs) were isolated using freeze drying.|$|R
25|$|In 1912, Thomas Dixon, Jr. {{decided that}} he wanted to turn his popular 1905 novel/play The Clansman into a film, and began visiting various studios to see if they were interested. In late 1913, Dixon met the film {{producer}} Harry Aitken, who was interested in making a film out of The Clansman, and through Aitken, Dixon met Griffith. Griffith began production in July 1914 and was finished by October 1914. The Birth of a Nation began filming in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands. It also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color <b>tinting</b> for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.|$|E
