40|$|Long range {{electric}} {{generating capacity}} expansion planning requires consideration of a {{diverse range of}} issues including economic and financial evaluations, environmental protection, and overall system reliability. To determine the optimum system expansion plan, {{it is necessary to}} create a synthesis of combinations of possible technical alternatives, observe the intertemporal effects of the system along the dimensions of the problem, and choose the set of alternatives which best meets the objectives while satisfying all constraints. A system of integrated techniques and computer codes (called the Generation Expansion Model) has been formulated to evaluate the economic, environmental, and reliability aspects of regional generation expansion strategies. The computer codes comprising the model are used serially and in an iterative manner to find the set of plant and site alternatives and the corresponding plant operating histories which will minimize the <b>total</b> <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> of all capital, operating, and fuel costs while satisfying the demand for electricity, fuel availability, site availability, pollution limits, and reliability constraints.

As a contribution to the vision, this thesis is produced. People nowadays have awareness about renewable energy and its benefits. However, renewable energy sources are unpredictable and changeable with climate change. The best solution to overcome these challenges is to combine multiple renewable energy sources in one energy system. Combining multiple RE sources provides reliable system that meets the energy demand. It is very important in designing a hybrid system to optimally size the system components as sufficient enough to meet the load requirements with minimum total costs. In this thesis, an optimal sizing of a hybrid renewable energy system for an existing building is proposed. The aim is to maximize the renewable energy ratio of the building and to minimize the <b>total</b> net <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> of cost as well as CO 2 emission. The proposed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) consists of solar panels, wind turbines and waste energy management plant. Furthermore, a connection to the National grid is provided, where the proposed system can buy and sell from and to the grid. In this study a year collected data are used to calculate hourly power of PV panels, wind turbines and waste boilers for the whole year. Different designs with different combination of renewable energy sources are generated to match the demand of an existing building.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{provision}} {{of a water}} supply that is secure {{in the face of}} severe drought is a primary objective for urban water agencies – “running out of water” is not a viable option for a large city. However, there are other objectives that conflict with the primary one – these include minimizing costs and environmental impacts. A major challenge facing decision makers in the urban water sector is dealing with the trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. Multi-objective optimization methods have the potential to identify the optimal trade-offs between the competing objectives. The principal aim of this thesis is to address the shortcomings in existing multi-objective optimization applications to produce methods of greater practical relevance to urban water resource management. Review of past studies identified three practically significant shortcomings. Focusing exclusively on either long-term (or infrastructure) options or on short-term options such as operation rules may lead to sub-optimal solutions. The use of short climate forcing data time series in simulation models to evaluate drought security can produce solutions that make the system highly vulnerable to severe drought. Finally, the setting of a priori environmental constraints may hide trade-offs between environmental, economic and security factors that are of considerable interest to decision makers. These shortcomings are addressed by a new multi-objective methodology that exploits the ability of evolutionary algorithms to handle complex objective functions and simulation models. The principal novelty is the explicit treatment of drought security. A case study based on the headworks system for Australia’s largest city, Sydney, demonstrates the practical significance of these shortcomings and, importantly, the ability of the new approach to deal with these shortcomings in a practicable manner. In the face of urban population growth and the accompanying growth in water demand, the performance of the urban water resource system is expected to deteriorate over time. This will result in the need to intervene and adapt the system to the changing conditions. The scheduling capacity expansion problem seeks to identify the optimal schedule for the changes to the system. In past studies, this problem has been largely tackled by minimizing the <b>total</b> <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> of capital, operational and rationing costs. A significant drawback of minimizing the <b>total</b> <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost is that it is likely to produce solutions that lead to more severe and frequent rationing in the future. Such a solution is likely to be socially unacceptable. A multi-objective formulation for the scheduling capacity expansion problem is developed to overcome this shortcoming while addressing the need to explicitly deal with drought security and jointly optimize operating and infrastructure decisions. The formulation enables the trade-off between cost and equity (the equal sharing of the burden of restrictions over the planning horizon) to be explored. A case study based on the headworks system for Australia’s capital city, Canberra, demonstrates the advantages of the new approach. The optimization of urban water resource systems requires running simulation models tens of thousands of times. Given that simulation run times can range from less than a minute to thirty or more minutes, it is important to use a multi-objective optimization method which converges with the least number of evaluations (or simulations). To address this need, a detailed assessment is conducted of three benchmark multi-objective optimization methods and three newly developed methods based on ant colony optimization using case studies based on the Canberra and Sydney systems. No one method emerges as superior, although two of the six methods are identified as inferior...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the theory of}} optimal {{replacement}} investment decisions is employed to interpret the problem of depreciation accounting and market valuation. An asset should be replaced when its net contribution to <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> from an additional (marginal) year of service no longer exceeds its external market value. Three concepts of depreciation are contained or involved in this investment decision rule: market value, capital recovery, and net contribution to <b>present</b> <b>worth.</b> Market value and capital recovery are commonly suggested "methods" of depreciation. Net contribution to <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> declines with asset age, and represents a concept of depreciation that generally may not coincide with market valuation in exchange.

40|$|The {{personal}} dust monitor (PDM) {{is a new}} {{coal mine}} respirable dust sampling instrument that {{has the ability to}} provide accurate end-of-shift and real-time respirable dust exposure data. A hypothetical cost comparison analysis of the PDM with the current MSHA-required coal mine dust personal sampling unit (CMDPSU) was conducted. Some simplifying assumptions were made to create hypothetical cases for analysis. This analysis was limited to respirable dust sampling of one designated operator (DO) and one designated area (DA) for one mechanized mining unit (MMU) which operated one shift per day. Only sampling intervals of the minimum sampling as required by federal regulations and continuous sampling were analyzed. This cost analysis from the company perspective is only one part of an overall cost/benefit analysis that should be conducted at a later date. In this analysis, company-associated costs were examined for both sampling systems. Results show that the PDM, while it has high initial costs of approximately $ 12, 600, may be a cost-effective sampling system for measuring coal mine respirable dust. The estimated <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost of conducting the minimum required dust sampling over a five-year life ranges from $ 5, 850 to $ 19, 000 for the CMDPSU, with the higher <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost including costs of potential violations incurred.

In view of the deep uncertainty about future climate change, it is vital that robust solutions be found that secure urban bulk water systems against extreme drought. To tackle this challenge an approach was developed integrating: 1) a stochastic model of multi-site streamflow conditioned on future climate change scenarios.; 2) Monte Carlo simulation of the urban bulk water system incorporated into a robust optimization framework and solved using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.; and 3) a comprehensive decision space including operating rules, investment in new sources and source substitution and a drought contingency plan with multiple actions with increasingly severe economic and social impact. A case study demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for a complex urban bulk water supply system. The primary objective was to minimize the expected <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost arising from infrastructure investment, system operation and the social cost of "normal" and emergency restrictions. By introducing a second objective which minimizes either the difference in <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost between the driest and wettest future climate change scenarios or the <b>present</b> <b>worth</b> cost for driest climate scenario, the trade-off between efficiency and robustness was identified.
