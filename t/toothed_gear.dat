50|$|Whereas most markers have a {{feed tube}} {{attached}} to a hopper/loader that either drops paintballs one-by-one or force-feeds (in the case of some loaders) into the chamber, the Cyclone-Feed System is a housing {{on the right side}} of the marker. Contained within the housing are two star-shaped sprockets. Paintballs fall from a wide mouth hopper into the gaps between the spokes. As the operator fires, excess gas from the firing cycle is routed to a cylinder, which holds a piston. Gas pressure pushes the piston forward, also compressing a spring which will return the piston when the gas pressure in the cylinder drops; at far end of its travel, the piston is connected to a ratchet which interacts with a <b>toothed</b> <b>gear,</b> the advancement of which on the piston's return stroke because it regulates the force with which the paintballs are struck by the spokes rotates the position of the spokes counterclockwise and feeds a paintball into the chamber. This effectively means that the rate at which paintballs are being fed into the marker is dependent on the rate at which the operator pulls the trigger. Users have reported speeds in excess of 25 bit/s, but this requires mechanical modification to the stock cyclone parts. It is advertised at 15+ bps.|$|E

40|$|The known {{attempts}} {{to create a}} continuously-adjustable gear train with solid gears have led to development of some so-called adaptive gears. The most structurally simple version of continuously- adjustable gear train is a two-wheel planetary gear.

In respect of the mentioned gear one of the controlled elements that is a compound central <b>toothed</b> <b>gear</b> has such controlled parameter as a nominal pitch diameter.

Other controlled element which is a planetary carrier has its own radius as a controlled parameter and makes a rotary motion with a great speed of a leading element.

40|$|<b>Toothed</b> <b>gear</b> power {{transmissions}} {{are complex}} mechanical systems and their design {{is a very}} challenging engineering task that requires the application of common calculation procedures and contemporary designing methods. Operating conditions of the gear power transmission are important for the design process from the aspect of overload prediction and they are defined within the design process by the operating condition factor KA, which has {{a wide range of}} values (1 to 2. 5), prescribing various operating situations.
