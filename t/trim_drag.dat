5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the control}} {{surfaces}} were pure delta wings. The main wing was swept at 55degrees, and could be rotated around the spar to provide variable incidence. For takeoff and landing, the wing was tilted upwards to increase the angle of attack while keeping the fuselage nearly horizontal. The length of the fuselage {{made it difficult to}} achieve the same end by tilting the entire aircraft upwards, which would have required a very long extension on the landing gear. The system also allowed the fuselage to fly flat to the airflow at various speeds, setting the trim angle independent of the aircraft as a whole. This decreased <b>trim</b> <b>drag,</b> thus improving range.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} rapidly {{evaluating}} the structural and aerodynamic characteristics of joined-wing aircraft {{was developed and}} used to study the fundamental advantages attributed to this concept. The technique involves a rapid turnaround aerodynamic analysis method for computing minimum <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> combined with a simple structural optimization. A variety of joined-wing designs are compared {{on the basis of}} <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag,</b> structural weight, and, finally, <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> with fixed structural weight. The range of joined-wing design parameters resulting in best cruise performance is identified.

The {{results showed}} excellent agreement between wind-tunnel and flight <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> polars at Mach numbers less than 0. 67.

40|$|A {{transonic}} computational {{analysis method}} and a transonic design procedure {{have been used}} to design the wing and the canard of a forward-swept-wing fighter configuration for good transonic maneuver performance. A model of this configuration was tested in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. Oil-flow photographs were obtained to examine the wind flow patterns at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 0. 90. The transonic theory gave a reasonably good estimate of the wing pressure distributions at transonic maneuver conditions. Comparison of the forward-swept-wing configuration with an equivalent aft-swept-wing-configuration showed that, at a Mach number of 0. 90 and a lift coefficient of 0. 9, the two configurations have the same <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag.</b> The forward-swept wing configuration was also found to have <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> levels at transonic maneuver conditions which are comparable to those of the HiMAT (highly maneuverable aircraft technology) configuration and the X- 29 forward-swept-wing research configuration. The configuration of this study was also tested with a forebody strake...|$|R
500|$|North American {{improved}} on {{the basic}} concept by adding a set of drooping wing tip panels that were lowered at high speed. This helped trap the shock wave under the wing between the downturned wing tips. It also added more vertical surface to the aircraft to maintain directional stability at high speeds. NAA's solution had an additional advantage, as it decreased the surface area of {{the rear of the}} wing when the panels were moved into their high-speed position. This helped offset the natural rearward shift of the center of pressure, or [...] "average lift point", with increasing speeds. Under normal conditions this caused an increasing nose-down trim, which had to be offset by moving the control surfaces, increasing drag. When the wing tips were drooped, the surface area {{at the rear of the}} wings was lessened, moving the lift forward and reducing <b>trim</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|The X-29 is {{described}} as a three surface aircraft, with canards, forward-swept wings, and aft strake control surfaces, using three-surface longitudinal control. The canards and wings result in reduced <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> and reduced wave drag, while using the strakes for trim in situations where the center of gravity is off provides less <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> than relying on the canard to compensate.|$|E
5000|$|On some {{aircraft}} (e.g. Concorde, McDonnell Douglas MD-11), fuel may {{be shifted}} to tanks {{in the tail}} during cruise to reposition {{the center of gravity}} in order to reduce <b>trim</b> <b>drag.</b> Maintaining the cg near the most aft limit for cruise improves cruise efficiency.|$|E
40|$|This is the Lamar design program, LamDes 2. f. It {{can be used}} as a non-planar LIDRAG to get span e for {{multiple}} lifting surface cases when user supplies spanload. It has also been called the Lamar/Mason optimization code. It finds the spanload to minimize the sum of the induced and pressure drag, including canards or winglets. It also provides the associated camber distribution for subsonic flow. Since two surfaces are included, it can find the minimum <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> while satisfying a pitching moment constraint. The program will prompt you for the input file name.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} at low speeds {{has been}} made to study the aerodynamic characteristics of a small-scale sweptback-wing Jet-transport model equipped with an external-flow jet-augmented double slotted flap. Included in the investigation were tests of the wing alone to study the effects of varying the spanwise extent of blowing on the full-span flap. The results indicated that the double-slotted-flap arrangement of the present investigation was more efficient in terms of lift and drag than were the external-flow single-slotted-flap arrangements previously tested and gave a substantial reduction In the thrust-weight ratio required for a given lift coefficient under <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> conditions. An increase in the spanwise extent of blowing on the full-span flap was also found to increase the efficiency of the model in terms of the lift and drag but, as would be expected on a sweptback-wing configuration, was accompanied by significant increases in negative pitching moment...|$|R

Flight tests which demonstrate the aerodynamic separation of the full-scale aeroshell and the flying qualities of the entry configuration in an uncontrolled mode are documented. Design values selected for the heat protection system based on the test data and analysis performed are presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{many modern}} {{conventional}} aircraft, {{the center of}} gravity is placed ahead of the center of pressure of the main wing. The wing lift then exerts a pitch-down moment around the centre of gravity, which must be balanced by a pitch-up moment (implying negative lift) from the tailplane. A disadvantage is that it generates <b>trim</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{sailplane}} is {{trimmed in}} pitch via an innovative variable-position horizontal stabilizer. The stabilizer position {{is governed by}} the flaperon setting. The five settings of the flaperons control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed {{in relation to the}} flaperons requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing <b>trim</b> <b>drag.</b> There is a fixed or retractable main wheel behind the pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control lever aft travel.|$|E
5000|$|The chine lift {{increases}} with {{the square of}} the Mach number, helping counterbalance the rearward shift in the lift of the main wing in supersonic conditions. If a tailless (Delta) wing is trimmed for safe subsonic flight, at high speeds it gains excess <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> in pitch and becomes excessively stable resulting in poor manoeuvrability. The destabilising effect of a forward surface is provided by the chines where it is needed most, at high Mach numbers.|$|E

40|$|Results {{from the}} Fourth AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW-IV) are summarized. The {{workshop}} {{focused on the}} prediction of both absolute and differential drag levels for wing-body and wing-body-horizontal-tail configurations that are representative of transonic transport air- craft. Numerical calculations are performed using industry-relevant test cases that include lift- specific flight conditions, <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> polars, downwash variations, dragrises and Reynolds- number effects. Drag, lift and pitching moment predictions from numerous Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics methods are presented. Solutions are performed on structured, unstructured and hybrid grid systems. The structured-grid sets include point- matched multi-block meshes and over-set grid systems. The unstructured and hybrid grid sets are comprised of tetrahedral, pyramid, prismatic, and hexahedral elements. Effort is made to provide a high-quality and parametrically consistent family of grids for each grid type about each configuration under study. The wing-body-horizontal families are comprised of a coarse, medium and fine grid; an optional extra-fine grid augments several of the grid families. These mesh sequences are utilized to determine asymptotic grid-convergence characteristics of the solution sets, and to estimate grid-converged absolute drag levels of the wing-body-horizontal configuration using Richardson extrapolation...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the fourth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW-IV), the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) wing-body and wing-body-tail configurations are analyzed using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solvers CFL 3 D and OVERFLOW. Two families of structured, overset grids are built for DPW-IV. Grid Family 1 (GF 1) consists of a coarse (7. 2 million), medium (16. 9 million), fine (56. 5 million), and extra-fine (189. 4 million) mesh. Grid Family 2 (GF 2) {{is an extension of}} the first and includes a superfine (714. 2 million) and an ultra-fine (2. 4 billion) mesh. The medium grid anchors both families with an established build process for accurate cruise drag prediction studies. This base mesh is coarsened and enhanced to form a set of parametrically equivalent grids that increase in size by a factor of roughly 3. 4 from one level to the next denser level. Both CFL 3 D and OVERFLOW are run on GF 1 using a consistent numerical approach. Additional OVERFLOW runs are made to study effects of differencing scheme and turbulence model on GF 1 and to obtain results for GF 2. All CFD results are post-processed using Richardson extrapolation, and approximate grid-converged values of drag are compared. The medium grid is also used to compute a <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> polar for both codes...|$|R

40|$|The joined wing is an {{innovative}} aircraft configuration {{that has a}} its tail connected to the wing forming a diamond shape in both top and plan view. This geometric arrangement utilizes the tail for both pitch control and as a structural support for the wing. Several researchers have studied this configuration and predicted significant reductions in <b>trimmed</b> <b>drag</b> or structural weight when compared with a conventional T-tail configuration. Kroo et al. compared the cruise drag of joined wings with conventional designs of the same lifting-surface area and structural weight. This study showed an 11 percent reduction in cruise drag for the lifting system of a joined wing. Although this reduction in cruise drag is significant, a complete design study is needed before any economic savings can be claimed for a joined-wing transport. Mission constraints, such as runway length, could increase the wing area and eliminate potential drag savings. Since other design codes do not accurately represent the interaction between structures and aerodynamics for joined wings, we developed a new design code for this study. The aerodynamic and structural analyses {{in this study are}} significantly more sophisticated than those used in most conventional design codes. This sophistication was needed to predict the aerodynamic interference between the wing and tail and the stresses in the truss-like structure. This paper describes these analysis methods, discusses some problems encountered when applying the numerical optimizer NPSOL, and compares optimum joined wings with conventional aircraft on the basis of cruise drag, lifting surface weight, and direct operating cost (DOC) ...|$|R
50|$|Some gliders {{not only}} use flaps when landing, {{but also in}} flight to {{optimize}} the camber of the wing for the chosen speed. When thermalling, flaps may be partially extended to reduce the stalling speed so that the glider can be flown more slowly and thereby reduce the rate of sink, which lets the glider use the rising air of the thermal more efficiently, and to turn in a smaller circle to make best use of {{the core of the}} thermal. At higher speeds a negative flap setting is used to reduce the nose-down pitching moment. This reduces the balancing load required on the horizontal stabilizer, which in turn reduces the <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> associated with keeping the glider in longitudinal trim. Negative flap may also be used during the initial stage of an aerotow launch {{and at the end of}} the landing run in order to maintain better control by the ailerons.|$|E

5000|$|The F-14's {{wing sweep}} can be varied between 20° and 68° in flight, {{and can be}} {{automatically}} controlled by the Central Air Data Computer, which maintains wing sweep at the optimum lift-to-drag ratio as the Mach number varies; pilots can manually override the system if desired. When parked, the wings can be [...] "overswept" [...] to 75° to overlap the horizontal stabilizers to save deck space aboard carriers. In an emergency, the F-14 can land with the wings fully swept to 68°, although this presents a significant safety hazard due to greatly increased stall speed. Such an aircraft would typically be diverted from an aircraft carrier to a land base if an incident did occur. The F-14 has flown and landed safely with an asymmetrical wing-sweep on an aircraft carrier during testing; this capability {{could be used in}} emergencies. The wing pivot points were significantly spaced far apart. This had two benefits. The first was that weaponry could be fitted on a pylon on the fixed wing glove, liberating the wings from having swiveling pylons fitted, a feature which had proven to add significant drag on the F-111B. Since less of the total lifting area was variable, the centre of lift moved less as the wings moved reducing <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> at high speed. When the wing was swept back, its thickness-to-chord-ratio decreased which allowed the aircraft to satisfy the mach 2.4 top speed required by the U.S. Navy. The body of the aircraft contributed significantly to overall lift and so the Tomcat possessed a lower wing loading than its wing area would suggest. When carrying 4 Phoenix missiles or other heavy stores between the engines this advantage was lost and maneuverability was reduced in those configurations.|$|E
40|$|An {{aeroelastic}} analysis method, {{based on}} three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation aerodynamics, {{has been applied}} to improve the performance of fighter wings operating at sustained maneuver flight conditions. The scheme reduces the <b>trimmed</b> pressure <b>drag</b> of wings performing high-g maneuvers through a simultaneous application of control surface deflection and aeroelastic twist. The aerodynamic and structural interactions are decoupled by assuming an aeroelastic twist mode shape and optimizing the aerodynamic performance based on this aeroelastic mode. The wing structural stiffness properties are then determined through an inverse scheme based on the aerodynamic loads and desired twist at the maneuver flight condition. The decoupled technique is verified by performing a fully coupled aeroelastic analysis using the maneuver flight conditions and the optimized structural stiffness distributions...|$|R

Relative <b>trim</b> <b>drag</b> increments were measured in an experimental wind tunnel investigation conducted in the Langley 8 Foot Transonic Pressure Tunnel. The tests utilized a high aspect ratio supercritical wing and a wide body aircraft wing, in conjunction with five different horizontal tail configurations, mounted on a representative wide body fuselage.
