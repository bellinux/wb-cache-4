5|$|Johnson's friends accused Erskine {{of using}} the trial as a {{political}} platform and not thinking of {{the best interests of}} his client. Johnson's imprisonment was not harsh; being relatively wealthy, Johnson rented a home for himself within the prison, where he continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> weekly soirées.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{recklessness}} makes {{a complete}} mess {{of the warehouse}} while jeopardizing the employees' safety. Michael's plans <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union. Jan intimidates them into reconsidering, citing a liquidation of the branch {{if it were to}} unionize.|$|E
5|$|Spinks was a {{formidable}} specialist and professional competitor in straight rail billiards (early on), and balkline billiards (one {{of the most}} difficult of all cue sports), especially 14.2 and later 18.2 balkline, and skilled enough at the even more difficult 18.1 variant <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> own against World Champions.|$|E
50|$|Osayamen Osawe (born 13 September 1993) is a Nigerian footballer {{who plays}} as a striker for 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> Nigerian Citizenship, Osawe also holds British citizenship.|$|R

5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. Mary Surratt was {{the first}} woman {{executed}} by the United States government. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> horse.|$|E
60|$|Michel Rollin, in {{the other}} canoe, close alongside, was {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up <b>his</b> hand.|$|R

5|$|Six {{months after}} he took office, the FBI raided his office and homes for {{allegedly}} extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned {{in the face of}} extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.|$|E
5|$|Team North America {{closed the}} {{two-point}} gap by {{one point in}} men's team play, where they won {{two of the three}} games. Both Niklas Edin of Team World and Kevin Martin of Team North America won close games against Heath McCormick and Tom Brewster, respectively, while Glenn Howard made a double-takeout in the last end <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> lead and win the game over Thomas Ulsrud. At the end of the day, Team World led Team North America 5–4.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5000|$|In Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, {{specifically}} the [...] "Stormblood" [...] expansion, the character Thancred shares {{that he was}} raised on a island populated primarily of pirates that taught him various skills: from how to sell leather waistcoats (like Guybrush wears in the first game) and <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> breath for ten whole minutes (like Guybrush can do).|$|R
60|$|The Prince raised him, {{supporting}} {{his head on}} his own broad breast and shoulder, and signed <b>to</b> Simon <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lips the cup of water that stood near. Richard slightly revived, and in this posture breathed more easily.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton was able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This {{opened up the}} opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could not hope <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded {{that he must}} fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
60|$|He motioned <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up <b>his</b> glass, {{and filled}} it. Riderhood emptied {{it to the}} last drop and began again.|$|R

5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As {{this was not an}} Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{finally made}} his {{breakthrough}} in cricket in 1939–40, {{when he was}} selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He managed just four and seven, batting at number five in the order. When Victoria fielded, Miller ran out his future Invincibles captain Don Bradman. One of Miller's teammates was Percy Beames, who was also his manager at Vacuum Oil. Miller scored 41 and 47 not out in his second match <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> place. However, against New South Wales, Miller made a pair of 14s, having difficulties against leg spin. In the return match against South Australia, Miller took the initiative against leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett, aggressively advancing down the pitch and driving. Miller reached 108, his first century in Shield competition. Apart from the century, Miller had a moderate season, ending with 298 runs at 29.80.|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
50|$|Having failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> onto <b>his</b> {{place in}} the Manchester United squad, Januzaj left the club in July 2017, signing a five-year {{contract}} with Spanish club Real Sociedad.|$|R
60|$|They {{heard an}} inordinate roar of laughter, {{and there was}} Diabolus sitting {{opposite}} <b>to</b> them, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> sides, and lashing his tail about, {{as if he would}} have gone mad with glee.|$|R
