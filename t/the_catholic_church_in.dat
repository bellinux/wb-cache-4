5|$|After the {{transfer}} of Louisiana to the United States, the Spanish had ended subsidies to <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis. As a result, Catholics in St. Louis had no resident priest until the arrival of Louis William Valentine Dubourg in early January 1818. Upon his arrival, he replaced the original log chapel with a brick church, recruited priests, and established a seminary. By 1826, a separate St. Louis diocese was created. Joseph Rosati became the first bishop in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements {{to make it more}} accessible and attractive to the masses. The Church hierarchy went along with the notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, Pope Pius IX, {{with the}} support of the {{overwhelming}} majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church.</b> <b>In</b> 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements.

He also suggested that the pope should make a Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania).

5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>church</b> <b>in</b> the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population.

Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E

5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Church</b> <b>in</b> Nazareth. One {{of the leaders of}} the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
