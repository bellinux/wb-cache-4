5|$|Eraserhead is a 1977 American surrealist body horror film written, produced, and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Lynch. Shot in black-and-white, Eraserhead is Lynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film was produced {{with the assistance of}} the American Film Institute (AFI) during the director's time studying there. Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Jeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near, and Jack Fisk, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout the film, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator.|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into {{a pool of blood}} and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E

5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

25|$|In 2011 the BBC {{started a}} series of radio {{adaptation}}s of all the Philip Marlowe novels under the heading Classic Chandler. Toby Stephens played Philip Marlowe throughout.

The High Window (October 8, 2011), The Little Sister (October 15, 2011) and a 60-minute version of Poodle Springs (October 22, 2011).|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a {{character}} who is terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; the apparent [...] "girl next door" [...] appeal of <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze. David J. Skal, in his book The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, has described the film as [...] "depict human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned". Skal also posits a different characterization of <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator, casting her as [...] "desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval". In his book David Lynch Decoded, Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator is in fact Spencer's subconscious, a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after he does so, as if to reassure him {{that he has done}} right.|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 2007, No Smoke [...] The Shocking Truth About British Justice, by Sandra Lean, was {{published}} by Exposure Publishing. This book features the stories of seven high-profile convicted murderers, including Park, Luke Mitchell and Sion Jenkins. The book claims that the expert testimonies in <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lake trial were flawed, that certain evidence was withheld, and that the sensationalist reporting of the press at the time influenced the court by persuading them that Park {{was the only person}} who could have killed his wife.|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 {{feet down}} at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E
500|$|Eraserhead {{sound design}} has been {{considered}} one of its defining elements. Although the film features several hallmark visuals—the deformed infant and the sprawling industrial setting—these are matched by their accompanying sounds, as the [...] "incessant mewling" [...] and [...] "evocative aural landscape" [...] are paired with these respectively. The film features several constant industrial sounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. This fosters a [...] "threatening" [...] and [...] "unnerving" [...] atmosphere, which has been imitated in works such as David Fincher's 1995 thriller Seven and the Coen brothers' 1991 drama Barton Fink. The constant low-level noise has been perceived by James Wierzbicki in his book Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in Cinema as perhaps a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, and the soundtrack {{has been described as}} [...] "ruthlessly negligent of the difference between dream and reality". The film also begins a trend within Lynch's work of relating diegetic music to dreams, as when <b>the</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Radiator sings [...] "In Heaven" [...] during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also present in [...] "Episode 2" [...] of Twin Peaks, in which diegetic music carries over from a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's Blue Velvet, in which a similar focus is given to Roy Orbison's [...] "In Dreams".|$|E
500|$|Four more singles were {{released}} from Diamond Rio, all reaching top 10 on the Billboard country singles charts: [...] "Mirror, Mirror", [...] "Mama Don't Forget to Pray for Me", [...] "Norma Jean Riley" [...] (which was previously the B-side of [...] "Mama Don't Forget to Pray for Me"), and [...] "Nowhere Bound", {{the latter two}} of which were co-written by Powell. Roe and Prout had found both [...] "Mama Don't Forget to Pray for Me" [...] and [...] "Mirror, Mirror" [...] by attending shows at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, a popular spot for performances by aspiring songwriters. Truman and an employee of Arista had found [...] "Norma Jean Riley", which was originally titled [...] "Pretty Little Lady" [...] until DuBois remarked that <b>the</b> <b>lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song should have a name: [...] "It could be 'Norma Jean Riley', anything!" [...] Johnson spoke positively about [...] "Mama Don't Forget to Pray for Me", which was written and originally recorded by Larry Cordle, and the impact that it had on fans. He recalled a letter sent to him by a female fan who had {{run away from home}} and chose to return after hearing that song, and said that [...] "We already didn't wanna do the drinkin' songs and stuff... if you're gonna touch someone, touch them with something that's positive." ...|$|E

500|$|The Scottish {{national}} {{drama that}} emerged {{in the early nineteenth century}} was largely historical in nature and based around a core of adaptations of Scott's Waverley novels. The existing repertoire of Scottish-themed plays included Shakespeare's Macbeth (c. 1605), Friedrich Schiller's Maria Stuart (1800), John Home's Douglas (1756) and Ramsay's The Gentle Shepherd (1725), with the last two being the most popular plays among amateur groups. Ballets with Scottish themes included Jockey and Jenny and Love in the Highlands. Scott was keenly interested in drama, becoming a shareholder in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Baillie's Highland themed Family Legend was first produced in Edinburgh in 1810 with the help of Scott, as part of a deliberate attempt to stimulate a national Scottish drama. Scott also wrote five plays, of which Hallidon Hill (1822) and MacDuff's Cross (1822) were patriotic Scottish histories. Adaptations of the Waverley novels, first performed primarily in minor theatres, rather than the larger Patent theatres, included <b>The</b> <b>Lady</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lake (1817), The Heart of Midlothian (1819) (specifically described as a [...] "romantic play" [...] for its first performance), and Rob Roy, which underwent over 1,000 performances in Scotland in this period. Also adapted for the stage were Guy Mannering, The Bride of Lammermoor and The Abbot. These highly popular plays saw the social range and size of the audience for theatre expand and helped shape theatre-going practices in Scotland for the rest of the century.|$|E
