5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance the extension of <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> metro. As <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase {{took place at the}} two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E

5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Because of Einstein's {{travels to}} the Far East, {{he was unable to}} {{personally}} accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.|$|E

5|$|Jolin {{started to}} depict Stockholm {{when he moved}} to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of {{southern}} Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing Stadsgården or Riddarholmen, into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: Strömmen mot Kastellholmen (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> City Museum; Utsikt över Riddarholmen (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the Nationalmuseum but kept in the Moderna Museet, and Utsikt mot Kastellholmen (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum. In <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> från Söders höjder (Stockholm from the heights of Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees. These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of the motif involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting. There is always an air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11, 2014, and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23, 2015 by Merregnon Studios. The album, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of the arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a more traditional medley. The concert series was followed by Final Symphony II, a similar concert tour by Merregnon Studios which began in 2015 with music from Final Fantasy V, VII, IX, and XIII.|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VIII section was released on September 23, 2016, and unlike the original Final Symphony no album release has been announced to date. The concerts have been heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of the arrangements. Critics have claimed the concerts {{to be one of the}} highest quality video game music orchestral performances produced, along with the original Final Symphony, with the second tour considered to have simpler arrangement styles than the first but in turn be more approachable to audiences.|$|E

5|$|After the US Open, del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup {{semifinal}} against Serbia, winning both of his rubbers against Janko Tipsarević and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. This helped Argentina to a 3–2 victory over Serbia in the semifinals, booking {{their place in the}} final. He then played in <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> Open, losing in the second round to James Blake. He then reached the final in Vienna, losing {{for the first time to}} Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Despite having won the first set, he eventually lost the final. Del Potro then reached the semifinals of the Valencia Open 500, losing to eventual champion Marcel Granollers. He then withdrew from the Paris Masters due to a shoulder injury, wiping out his chances of qualifying for the Year-End Championships.|$|E
5|$|Australia's defence {{expenditure}} {{is much larger}} in dollar terms to that of most countries in Australia's region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China spends somewhat more on defence {{as a proportion of}} GDP than Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its expenditure. <b>The</b> <b>Stockholm</b> International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As a proportion of GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for which data is available.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the city}} and the horizon are several rural islands, which today form part of central Stockholm. Behind the church and the castle is Skeppsholmen, which for centuries served as a base for the Swedish Navy {{together}} with Kastellholmen islet, which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery. To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of Blasieholmen. Behind these islands are Djurgården (right), Östermalm, and Norra Djurgården (left). On the horizon, the Lilla Värtan strait passes in front of Lidingö and, arguably, the interior islands of <b>the</b> <b>Stockholm</b> archipelago.|$|E
