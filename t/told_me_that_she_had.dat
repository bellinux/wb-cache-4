[...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{where is}} Freda?" [...] Edmund, {{who had been}} {{listening}} impatiently, exclaimed. [...] "One of your men <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been carried off. Is it true?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has lately}} {{got to know}} some nobleman; but I never {{supposed}} there could be any meaning in that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tremlett had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> seemed {{anxious and}} upset, and I went {{to have a}} chat with her; she soon cheered up and....' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I understand,' said Berenger. 'The Cure of Nissard <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was traced through cakes, {{the secret}} of which was only known at Bellaise.|$|R
60|$|When Sophy had {{finished}} her tale, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left her boy in London, {{and had come}} down to devote herself to the task she had so long had before her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very quietly. Your Aunt Letty <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{spent most}} of her time in prayer since she heard it. But Miss Letty seems to think that on your account she is very full of joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{she did not}} say that. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{declined}} the honour that you had offered her;--that she did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{should it}} have been?' the girl asked. 'Warbles <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could have no {{difficulty}} in proving {{where she was}} at the time.' ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I {{know what}} <b>she</b> prefers? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is barely}} nine o'clock, Mademoiselle, but Monsieur Bellamy--Mademoiselle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished to receive him {{whenever}} he came. He {{is in the}} boudoir now, and very impatient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found Anne in a {{state of}} the wildest grief. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen Philip shot by the vicomte, just as he was attacking him, and that you in turn had cut down the villain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told that--that your father--is alive." [...] He looked down upon her and could see that her face was red up to her very hair. [...] "Your mother once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never been certain of his death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Oswald {{were away}} {{together}} when she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{made up her}} mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since {{you have been in}} the house. He certainly has not spoken to her about you since you came to us." ...|$|E
60|$|Something in {{her eyes}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished <b>me</b> to follow her, and I did so. Outside the portico where we stood in the desolate, lighted street, she halted.|$|R
6000|$|... "She has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{feels the}} {{greatest}} faith in him," [...] I answered. [...] "She firmly {{believes that he}} speaks the truth in saying he can cure you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was called}} Dian the Beautiful, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{belonged to the}} tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.|$|R
60|$|When {{the two had}} disappeared, Emily, {{no longer}} {{restraining}} her tears, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> exchanged Prayer-books with him, and they were to read the Psalms {{at the same time}} every day. 'I thought it might be a help to him,' she said simply.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed, {{staggering}} a {{few paces}} to a stone at the roadside, behind which she crouched. Afterwards she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no strength to go further, and indeed no will, since if we were killed, it were better that she who had warned us should be killed also.|$|E
6000|$|A faint {{breath of}} relief, just audible in the silence, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard him. It was her last effort. He laid her, insensible, on the bed, {{by the side}} of her {{sleeping}} child. [...] "Look at them," [...] was all he said to me; [...] "how could I refuse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely, old man. You're {{perfectly}} right. Well, {{to cut a}} {{long story}} short, Nelly Bryant <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Jill were rehearsing with a piece called 'The Rose of America.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t know," [...] ses Peter; [...] "but this chap <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> won’t {{walk out}} with anybody agin, unless it’s another prize-fighter. Her pride won’t let her, I s’pose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was to {{have met}} a gentleman to-night," [...] he said. [...] "Here, we must go and speak to her now, or she'll think that something's up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had a {{great deal}} to say to each other. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been longing to send me a message to warn me that Colonel Kaldhein would {{certainly}} kill me the next time he saw me; but she had no means of sending me such a message, for the Colonel had had her actions closely watched.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where {{she brought}} out,' said Mr Toots, 'this newspaper. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> kept it from Miss Dombey all day, {{on account of}} {{something}} that was in it, about somebody that she and Dombey used to know; and then she read the passage to me. Very well. Then she said--wait a minute; what was it she said, though!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{meant to}} come to you herself. She sent me instead. She thought it best. This man Dunster is being kept alive because there is {{something}} Miles wants him to tell him, and he won't. But to-night, if he is still alive, if he won't tell, they mean to make away with him. They are afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur is serious?" [...] he inquired. [...] "It {{is only a}} {{short time}} ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was dining with you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>she</b> did; <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{could read}} {{all sorts of}} things in my face, and offered, if I would give myself up to it, to make me more than human." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Gilmore. [...] "It's all of no use, {{and you are}} troubling {{yourself}} for nothing. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not care a straw for me;--but she accepted me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought so}} myself," [...] the Princess answered. [...] "Early this {{afternoon}} she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no sleep last night, {{that she had}} a very bad headache, and {{that she was going to}} bed. As a matter of fact she went out almost at once, and has not returned." [...] Cecil was already on his way to the door.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hemphill turned pale when, that afternoon, his hostess, in an {{exceedingly}} clear and plain manner, made known to him his fate. For {{a few moments}} he did not speak. Then he said very quietly: [...] "If she had not, of her own accord, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> once loved me, I should never have dared to say anything like that to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think you}} ought to know this. I went to Mr. Weiss' office. He did not know that the paper was not still in your keeping. I went to Stella, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not taken it for them. She told me that they had offered her one hundred {{thousand}} dollars for it, but she never had any idea of letting them have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Olaf, I {{know that}} you must not overtire {{yourself}} as yet, but your lady has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> desires to see the sunset from Odin's Mount. Have I your leave to take her there?" ...|$|R
60|$|Great was my anguish when my {{neighbor}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was no more. It seems the dear thing pined for her old home, and kept returning {{to it in}} spite of age or bad weather.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is not the}} way to know. If a girl <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> liked <b>me</b> {{better than}} any other girl, I should not know it, just because she said so. I should have to find it out.' ...|$|R
