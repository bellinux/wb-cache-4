5|$|Although {{the search}} {{recovered}} debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors were found. On her final voyage, Fitzgeralds crew of 29 {{consisted of the}} captain, the first, second and third mates, five engineers, three oilers, a cook, a wiper, two maintenance men, three watchmen, three deckhands, three wheelsmen, two porters, a cadet and a steward. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin; <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> ranged from 20-year-old watchman Karl A. Peckol to Captain McSorley, 63years old and planning his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Data {{obtained}} from the composition of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% {{obtained from}} the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to vary in their texture, <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E
5000|$|The United States uses English common law; {{because of}} this a person obtains <b>their</b> <b>age</b> {{on the day before}} their birthday.

5|$|The oldest coal balls {{were from}} the early end of the Namurian stage (326 to 313 mya) and {{discovered}} in Germany and former Czechoslovakia, but <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> generally range from the Permian (299 to 251 mya) to the Upper Carboniferous. Some coal balls from the US vary in age from the later end of the Westphalian (roughly 313 to 304 mya) to the later Stephanian (roughly 304 to 299 mya). European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian Stage.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over <b>their</b> <b>Ages.</b> The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found that seemed to say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could have been changed to 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in <b>their</b> <b>ages,</b> Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{was raised}} on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, {{shortly after the}} start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was {{established}} at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and most of those were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average age on formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts that this is not necessarily accurate as men were found to have altered <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon.|$|E
40|$|College {{students}} attribute {{more conservative}} {{attitudes and behaviors}} concerning alcohol use to themselves and progressively less conservative attitudes and behaviors to their friends and more distal peers. We examined whether a similar social-distancing effect would occur with adolescents in America and Ireland. Students (n = 2, 554) attributed the most conservative drinking frequency to themselves and progressively less conservative frequencies to their best friends, other good friends, other students <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at <b>their</b> own school, and other students <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at other schools, respectively. Similarly, adolescents attributed more disapproval of drinking to their best friends and progressively less conservative disapproval to other good friends, other students <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at <b>their</b> own school, and other students <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at other schools, respectively. As predicted, more social distancing occurred among Americans (relative to Irish) and girls (relative to boys) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{recordings}} from later half of 1990 s until 2005 {{have been}} used in our experiments. In all, the experimental corpus contains 534 recordings. It consists of speech from 10 Judges over several years and about 500 advocates. The birth dates of the Judges are known and hence <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at the time of an argument can be precisely calculated. The birth dates of the advocates are not easily available, hence wherever the birth dates were not available, <b>their</b> <b>age</b> has been approximated by using the year of their law graduation and assuming <b>their</b> <b>age</b> at graduation to be 25.|$|R

Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.|$|E
25|$|The 52 {{victims were}} of diverse backgrounds; {{among them were}} several {{foreign-born}} British nationals, foreign exchange students, parents, and one British couple of 14 years. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. <b>Their</b> <b>ages</b> ranged from 20 to 60 years old, {{with an average age}} of 34.|$|E

25|$|On April 27, two teenagers, aged 15 (though {{other sources}} cite <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> as 12 and 13), were arrested at a {{checkpoint}} near Jenin after 11 explosive charges {{were found on}} them. One teenager was recruited by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the other by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. The two told interrogators {{that they had been}} acting as couriers for terrorists, but security forces suspect they planned to get close to the soldiers and then detonate the charges.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{difficult}} to obtain precise and accurate statistics about street children, information about <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> is approximate. Most of the street children in India are over 6, and the majority is over 8. The mean age of street children in a National Institute of Urban Affairs study in 1989 was 13 years. Another study in 1989 by UNICEF found that 72 percent of the street children studied were ages 6–12 and 13 percent were under 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875. The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877. At the time, there were few {{high schools in the}} state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the University, a preparatory school was formed on campus. In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school. There were 38 men and 27 women, and <b>their</b> <b>ages</b> ranged from 12–23 years.|$|E
