2500|$|All {{units and}} {{structures}} belong {{to one of}} four technology tiers, or [...] "Tech" [...] levels, each tier being stronger and/or more efficient than the previous. Certain lower-tier structures can be upgraded into higher ones without having to rebuild them. The first tier {{is available at the}} start of the game and consists of small, relatively weak units and structures. The second tier expands the player's abilities greatly, especially in terms of stationary weapons and shielding, and introduces upgraded versions of tier one units. The third <b>tier</b> <b>level</b> has very powerful assault units designed to overcome the fortifications of the most entrenched player. The fourth tier is a limited range of [...] "experimental" [...] technology. These are usually massive units which take a lot of time and energy to produce, but provide a significant tactical advantage.|$|E

They won the U16 All-Ireland 'C' hurling title after they beat Tyrone in the Monaghan Centre of Excellence in 2012. This was a great achievement for Sligo hurling.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we use Taiwan {{as a case study}} to provide an economy-wide {{analysis}} of impacts on Taiwan of WTO tariff reduction schemes with different combinations of thresholds and reduction rates. The model we utilized in this study is Taiwan General Equilibrium Model with a WTO module (TAIGEM-WTO, hereafter) that is a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Taiwan's economy derived from Australian ORANI model (Dixon, Parmenter, Sutton and Vincent, 1982). Simulation results show that results are more sensitive to the scheme of tariff-reduction (i. e., Category 1, 2, and 3) than the <b>tiered</b> <b>levels</b> (i. e., A, B, C, and D) and as a strategy we should {{pay more attention to the}} arguments related to the amounts of tariff-reduction. Moreover, changes in nominal average tariff rates are more sensitive and shocks to the economy are more severe when we change the tariff reduction categories rather than the <b>tiered</b> <b>levels.</b> This conclusion also applies to the tiered reduction case when only sensitive products are considered. Finally, simulations with sector's bound rate calculated using arithmetic means have bigger effects than those using import values as weights. Therefore, sector's bound rate using import values as weights would be preferred. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE), Tiered Formula, WTO, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
