During the summer he wrote five new vignettes (chapters 12–16), all about bullfighting, {{finishing}} the last two on his return to Paris in August. That summer he also honed new narrative techniques in chapters 7–11. In August he reported to Pound {{that he was about}} to begin the last two pieces (chapters 17 and 18), implemented revisions that Pound suggested, and sent the manuscript to Bill Bird. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Paris with Hadley (who was pregnant with their first child) for Toronto, where he was living when Bird finished producing the book.|$|E

Percussionist Boris Kinberg, a longtime member of the Mink DeVille Band, said about the stages of Willy DeVille's career:To my mind there were three main eras. The first era was the Lower East Side, skinny tie, purple shirt, West Side Story, Puerto Rican Sharks gang vibe. Then it transmuted into the Mississippi plantation-gambler riverboat rogue, the Rhett Butler thing where he had had custom-made suits, and really got into the period and the clothes and just totally immersed himself in New Orleans, not the present New Orleans, but the New Orleans of the 1880s and 1890s—the Absinthe-drinking, voodoo New Orleans. He totally immersed himself in that. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> New Orleans and moved to the Southwest and came back as the second coming of Black Elk.|$|E

There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
