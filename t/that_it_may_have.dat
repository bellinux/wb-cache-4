5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings and {{estimated}} orbit size of Plateosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been cathemeral, active {{throughout the day}} and night, possibly avoiding the midday heat.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Archaeopteryx and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been diurnal, similar to most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Herrerasaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been cathemeral, active {{throughout the day}} at short intervals.|$|E

5|$|Further {{observations}} will {{be needed}} in order to determine S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit. If it is circular, it would suggest that S/2015 (136472) 1 was formed by an ancient impact event, but if it is elliptical, it suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been captured.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, {{given its}} {{conservation}} status, Kingsley Dixon of Kings Park and Botanic Garden suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Oryzomys peninsulae arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been introduced from {{another part of}} Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits.|$|E
50|$|Fossils of Wagner's mustached bat {{have been}} found on Tobago, {{indicating}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> once <b>have</b> had a wider range than it has today. The fossils date from the late Pleistocene.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they interpreted as a folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids {{may be related to}} a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had a more favourable climate), {{but the lack of}} pollen may be the product of a deeper lake. Polylepis may have thrived in favourable salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena pollen is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{as to what}} functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times {{in the evolution of}} the crest and its internal nasal passages.|$|E
5000|$|A 2017 {{preprint}} [...] reported surveys {{showing no}} evidence that associated voids {{in the line of}} sight could have caused the CMB Cold Spot and concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> instead <b>have</b> a primordial origin.|$|R
50|$|While {{artesunate}} is {{used primarily}} as treatment for malaria, {{there is some}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> some beneficial effects in Schistosoma haematobium infection, but has not been evaluated in large randomized trials.|$|R
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{train of}} thought places Broadclough Dykes as an ancient structure, however there is a suggestion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> actually <b>have</b> an industrial origin as open-cast site for extraction of fireclay, from beneath an exposed coal seam.|$|R
5|$|The Great Gatsby (1926), by Herbert Brenon– {{a silent}} movie of a stage adaptation, {{starring}} Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson, and William Powell. It is a famous {{example of a}} lost film. Reviews suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives {{is all that is}} known to exist.|$|E
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} opinion found <b>that</b> though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been rude for Pierson to have killed the fox, {{there was no}} reason to object as only the person to mortally wound or seize the animal can acquire possession of it.|$|R
50|$|I. A. Shapiro doubts the {{existence}} of Ladies' Hall as a school, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> simply <b>have</b> been where the young gentlewomen attending Queen Anne's ladies-in-waiting were housed, and that the ladies there had joined together to perform a play.|$|R
5000|$|The genus <b>may</b> <b>have</b> a Gondwanan origin; <b>that</b> is, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> arisen before Africa and Australia {{separated}} into distinct continents.

5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{earthquake}} occurred before seismometers were {{operating in the}} region, {{the magnitude of the}} shock and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available for the event were studied, and various epicenters for the event were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated moment magnitude of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location {{on the east side of}} the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a larger event, placing the shock in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not certain}} {{precisely}} where the wilderness of Paran is to be located. It {{is often associated with}} Mount Sinai in Egypt, and there is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> originally <b>have</b> referred to the southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula.|$|R
25|$|It {{lies about}} onekm (0.62 miles) {{to the west}} of the hamlet of St Lythans, near Dyffryn Gardens. It also lies around one mile (1.6km) south of Tinkinswood burial chamber, a more {{extensive}} cromlech <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> once <b>have</b> resembled, constructed during the same period.|$|R
50|$|Datousaurus {{was about}} 15 metres long and herbivorous. It {{had a deep}} large skull for a sauropod. The rarity of its fossils suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been as social as other sauropods, which are often {{preserved}} in large numbers in a single deposit.|$|R
5|$|Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric {{served as}} Edward's chaplain, {{although}} how or when exactly {{the two met}} is unknown. The historian Frank Barlow speculates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been at Bruges in 1039. When Edward returned to England {{at the invitation of}} King Harthacnut, Edward's half-brother, Leofric accompanied him, witnessing charters during Harthacnut's lifetime along with Herman who later became Bishop of Sherborne. Leofric remained a close supporter and friend of Edward for the king's entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been cathemeral, active {{throughout the day}} at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also {{seems to have been}} greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} this legend is really {{uncertain}} {{to the point}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> its historical origin. <b>It</b> is believed <b>that</b> figure {{was created by the}} Cocollona own tour guides in an effort to add a new creature beasts of mythology Girona.|$|R
50|$|Tillandsia × smalliana is {{a natural}} hybrid (T. balbisiana × T. fasciculata) in the genus Tillandsia. This plant is native to the US state of Florida. Some reports {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> formerly <b>have</b> existed also in Central America, but is now apparently extinct there.|$|R
25|$|However, at some point, both regions <b>may</b> <b>have</b> lapsed {{back into}} Hittite control. What exactly {{happened}} to Amurru is disputed. The Hittitologist Trevor Bryce suggests <b>that,</b> although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> fallen once again under Hittite control, {{it is more}} likely Amurru remained a Hittite vassal state.|$|R
