5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave.

On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
