5|$|The scales along <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> {{the snake}} are called labials. Those {{on the upper}} lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.|$|E

25|$|In the female, a {{deep groove}} forms around the phallus. The sides of it grow dorsalward as the labioscrotal folds, which {{ultimately}} form the labia majora in females. The labia minora, in contrast, arise by the continued growth of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> the groove on the under {{surface of the}} phallus; {{the remainder of the}} phallus forms the clitoral glans.|$|E

25|$|Many STIs are (more easily) {{transmitted}} through the mucous membranes of the penis, vulva, rectum, urinary tract and (less often—depending on type of infection) the mouth, throat, respiratory tract and eyes. The visible membrane covering {{the head of}} the penis is a mucous membrane, though it produces no mucus (similar to <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> the mouth). Mucous membranes differ from skin in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.|$|E
25|$|According {{to certain}} fabulous reports of ancient writers, Plato's mother became {{pregnant}} from a divine vision: Ariston {{tried to force}} his attentions on Perictione, but failed of his purpose; then the ancient Greek god Apollo appeared {{to him in a}} vision, and, as a result of it, Ariston left Perictione unmolested. When she had given birth to Plato, only then did her husband lie with her. Another legend related that, while he was sleeping as an infant on Mount Hymettus in a bower of myrtles (his parents were sacrificing to the Muses and Nymphs), bees had settled on <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> Plato; an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse philosophy.|$|E

25|$|This {{personal}} rebuff {{could not}} alter {{the fact that his}} name was on <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> voters at the election. His supporters won a large majority, and Jules Ferry's cabinet quickly resigned. Gambetta was unwillingly asked by Grévy on 24 November 1881 to form a ministry, known as Le Grand Ministère. Many suspected him of desiring a dictatorship; unjust attacks were directed against him from all sides, and his cabinet fell on 26 January 1882, after only sixty-six days. Had he remained in office, he would have cultivated the British alliance and cooperated with Britain in Egypt; and when the succeeding Freycinet government shrank from that enterprise only to see it undertaken with signal success by Britain alone, Gambetta's foresight was quickly justified.|$|E
25|$|The Psalms {{have always}} been an {{important}} part of Catholic liturgy. From earliest times until today, Christians view the Old Testament as prefiguring Christ. The evangelists put the words of the psalms on <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> Jesus during his passion. Along these lines, ancient monks and nuns in the Egyptian desert heard Jesus' voice in all the psalms. They believed the psalms were written by King David, but they also believed that the pre-existent Christ inspired David to do the writing (Ps 110:1). For this reason, they prayed the whole Psalter daily. This tradition has grown and changed, but it still continues, faithful to the ancient practice. In Christian monasteries and many religious houses throughout the world, vowed men and women gather three to seven times daily to pray the psalms.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour later}} the British {{trenches}} had been occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind sap (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered once they had been discovered. The Germans had great difficulty consolidating their new positions, in the dark, under artillery-fire and counter-attack and in the 8th Company area, the troops formed a human chain to pass hand-grenades forward. As dawn broke the new positions had been dug down to head height but linking the new diggings to <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> craters was done with great difficulty because the explosions had thrown {{a great deal of}} earth onto the crater edges and British troops were throwing grenades into the craters. Communication trenches were too shallow and soldiers had to crawl along them once dawn had broken and many were hit by bullets. The captured trenches had much British equipment in them which was used by the Germans to repulse counter-attacks.|$|E

500|$|Ben Gerson from Rolling Stone {{called the}} songs on the album [...] "forgettable" [...] and [...] "unconvincing". He also criticized Streisand's {{authenticity}} when singing lyrics that he considered [...] "meaningless from <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> an American". Because of the lackluster response generated from the record, Streisand decided to work with new musicians on her following album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). Her decision pleased both critics and her fans, who felt that the new album was stronger than ButterFly. Years later in 1991, Streisand took to Larry King Live and announced her complete displeasure with ButterFly and {{the songs on}} it. She deemed it as her least favorite album and joked that {{she would like to}} withdraw it from her catalog altogether.|$|E
500|$|Due to the glans's high sensitivity, direct {{stimulation}} {{to it is}} {{not always}} pleasurable; instead, direct stimulation to the hood or the areas near the glans are often more pleasurable, with the majority of females preferring to use the hood to stimulate the glans, or to have the glans rolled between <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> <b>of</b> the labia, for indirect touch. It is also common for women to [...] "enjoy a light caressing of the shaft of the clitoris" [...] combined with the occasional circling of the clitoral glans, with or without manual penetration of the vagina, while other women enjoy having the entire area of the vulva caressed. As opposed to use of dry fingers, stimulation from fingers that have been well-lubricated, either by vaginal lubrication or a personal lubricant, is usually more pleasurable for the external anatomy of the clitoris.|$|E
