40|$|The {{environment}} of Aflaj system is shared between natural and old man made} created thousandth {{years ago to}} accommodate the old civilization. Howeverl this environment is disturbed by the climatic changes which affect the total area causing drought and desertification. The 2008 Stockholm World Water Week and the third Water WDR conference concluded that "The main impacts of climate change on humans and the environment occur through water". This effect of climate change is reflected by a degradation of Falaj numbers which cause drought and desertification of the soil in a valuable place such as, Oman Mountains rang. Accordingly, the impact of climate change on Aflaj environment can be identified by Fa/aj dry out and Water deficit in most Aflaj oasis, which lead to a desertification of irrigated areas and a reduction of green areas. AdditionallYl the more warmer and drier the land becomes, the more water is required. The higher temperature causes high water demand and evaporation from trees which cause rapid drying of existing crops. Moreover, drier soil is easy eroded by the rain and runoff which worsening the environment. This is being seen as a warning {{and that it is}} time <b>to</b> <b>commence</b> <b>taking</b> steps to reduce the effect of climate change and save the environment. This paper shows the effect of climate change on the Aflaj Oasis environment and its impacts. Given the importance of the Aflaj system to the Oman's society, the paper highlights the potential strategies to mitigate or reduce those impacts to sustain Aflaj environment. The strategy recommends better water management} impact minimisation and monitor and control. More efforts should be given for the use of water saving technology. With all of these measures, impact of climate change on Aflaj Oasis environment can be reduced...|$|E

A first NEMO 3 measurement of the 2 νββ half-life of 130 Te is presented, giving a value of T 2 ν 1 / 2 = (7. 6 ± 1. 5 (stat) ± 0. 8 (syst)) × 1020 years.

Approximately 109 events, corresponding to 80 TBytes of information, are expected to be accumulated per year. In addition the collaboration is large and geographically dispersed- almost 500 physicists from 80 institutions in 10 countries. Thus the computing issues break down into two categories- technical and sociological/managerial. Both of these will be discussed. The major focus will be on the work that is underway to establish a distributed software development environment, the computing model that is the baseline plan for dealing with the onslaught of data, and more speculative avenues that are expected to be explored in parallel with this baseline. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Obesity is a {{significant}} global health problem, with approximately 50 % of women entering pregnancy having a body mass index {{greater than or equal}} to 25 kg/m 2. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a well-recognised increased risk of adverse health outcomes both for the woman and her infant. Currently available data from large scale randomised trials and systematic reviews highlight only modest effects of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions in limiting gestational weight gain, with little impact on clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes. Further information evaluating alternative strategies is required. The aims of this randomised controlled trial are to assess whether the use of metformin as an adjunct therapy to dietary and lifestyle advice for overweight and obese women during pregnancy is effective in improving maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes. Methods: Design: Multicentre randomised, controlled trial. Inclusion Criteria: Women with a singleton, live gestation between 10 + 0 - 20 + 0 weeks who are obese or overweight (defined as body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 25 kg/m 2), at the first antenatal visit. Trial Entry & Randomisation: Eligible, consenting women will be randomised between 10 + 0 and 20 + 0 weeks gestation using an online computer randomisation system, and randomisation schedule prepared by non-clinical research staff with balanced variable blocks. Stratification will be according to maternal BMI at trial entry, parity, and centre where planned to give birth. Treatment Schedules: Women randomised to the Metformin Group will receive a supply of 500 mg oral metformin tablets. Women randomised to the Placebo Group will receive a supply of identical appearing and tasting placebo tablets. Women will be instructed <b>to</b> <b>commence</b> <b>taking</b> one tablet daily for a period of one week, increasing to a maximum of two tablets twice daily over four weeks and then continuing until birth. Women, clinicians, researchers and outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated treatment group. All women will receive three face-to-face sessions (two with a research dietitian and one with a trained research assistant), and three telephone calls over the course of their pregnancy, in which they will be provided with dietary and lifestyle advice, and encouraged to make change utilising a SMART goals approach. Primary Study Outcome: infant birth weight > 4000 grams. Sample Size: 524 women to detect a difference from 15. 5 % to 7. 35 % reduction in infants with birth weight > 4000 grams (p[*]=[*] 0. 05, 80 % power, two-tailed). Discussion: This is a protocol for a randomised trial. The findings will contribute to the development of evidence based clinical practice guidelines.

40|$|The muon {{spectrometer}} of the ATLAS experiment, {{which is}} scheduled <b>to</b> <b>commence</b> data <b>taking</b> at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC at CERN in 2007, comprises {{more than a thousand}} muon stations, which have the double purpose of triggering on high-p/sub t/ muon tracks as well as providing precise trajectory reconstruction. While monitored drift tube chambers are used for track reconstruction in all of the muon spectrometer except for a region close to the beam pipe in forward direction, two different technologies are used for triggering, resistive plate chambers in the barrel region and thin gap chambers in the end-caps. Both have in common that the ATLAS geometry allows only limited accessibility after chambers are installed in the detector. A thorough testing and certification prior to installation is therefore crucial. This paper reviews the test procedure at CERN for barrel chambers of type BO and BM, i. e. of stations for which a drift chamber is coupled with one or two resistive plate chambers. The final certification criterion is the passing of a 1 -day cosmic ray test, for which a special setup has been built during the last year. Questions of verifying cable maps, HV stability and drift properties are addressed...|$|R

Exploring the effect of measuring in different days of biological rhythm cycles on the correlations among physical, emotional and mental capabilities. Comparing the physical, emotional and mental of day of birth with these capabilities at different biological rhythm stages. The researchers used the descriptive methods. The sample was (24) students, aged (18 - 22) years. The following tests are used: Running test (50 m), standard broad jump, sit-up, running and walking for 12 minutes, zigzag running 4 x 9 m, Bending the body forward and downward, stability balancing, shooting on interfered circles in handball, emotional tests, attention test to measure mental status by Burdon – Anvimov test.
