5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. <b>The</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E
