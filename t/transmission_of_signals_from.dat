Src homology 2 domains are globular protein modules present in a large variety of functionally distinct proteins.

5000|$|The axon reflex was {{discovered}} and {{was described as}} [...] "a new type of peripheral reflex" [...] that bypasses the integration center and synapse in the central nervous system. The discovery of the axonal reflex found that the axon reflex activates local arterioles causing vasodilation and muscle contraction. This muscle contraction was observed in people with asthma where the released neuropeptides caused the smooth muscle in the airway to contract. Similarly the release of cholinergic agents at sudomotor nerve terminals evokes an axon reflex that stimulates sweat glands inducing the body to sweat in response to heat. The axon reflex is possible through the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> the cutaneous receptors on the skin.|$|E
5000|$|For {{very large}} numbers (hundreds or even {{thousands}} of bits), lookahead carry logic does not become any more complex, because more layers of supergroups and supersupergroups can be added as necessary.

However, the [...] "slow roads" [...] on the way to the faster levels begin to impose a drag on the whole system (for instance, a 256-bit adder could have up to 24 gate delays in its carry processing), and the mere physical <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> one end of a long number to the other begins to be a problem.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the intermediary role <b>of</b> macrophages in <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> Ts 1 to Ts 2. The SF is adsorbed on live or heat-killed mouse peritoneal macrophages and transmits DV-specific PFC in spleen after i. p. or i. v. inoculation in DV-primed mice. The suppression is antigen-specific. SF or SF-adsorbed heat-killed macrophages failed to transmit suppression in silica-treated macrophage-depleted mice when injected i. p., while SF-adsorbed live macrophages could transmit suppression. In macrophage-depleted mice suppression could be transmitted by SF-adsorbed heat-killed macrophages on i. v. inoculation. It was therefore concluded that live macrophage-killed cells are also essential for <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> suppressor <b>signal</b> by SF <b>from</b> Ts 1 to Ts 2 in vivo...|$|R

40|$|One {{physiologic}} {{consequence of}} {{extended periods of}} weightlessness is the rapid loss of bone mass associated with skeletal unloading. Conversely, mechanical loading {{has been shown to}} increase bone formation and stimulate osteoblastic function. The mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction, or how the osteoblast senses and converts biophysical stimuli into cellular responses has yet to be determined. For non-innervated mechanosensitive cells like the osteoblast, mechanotransduction can be divided into four distinct phases: 1) mechanocoupling, or the characteristics of the mechanical force applied to the osteoblast, 2) biochemical coupling, or the mechanism through which mechanical strain is transduced into a cellular biochemical <b>signal,</b> 3) <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> sensor to effector cell and 4) the effector cell response. This review examines the characteristics of the mechanical strain encountered by osteoblasts, possible biochemical coupling mechanisms, and how the osteoblast responds to mechanical strain.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lymphocyte {{activation}} {{requires the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> molecules at the plasma membrane to nuclear signals that regulate gene expression. In recent years, several immunosuppressive compounds {{have been used}} as probes to identify important and potentially novel molecules involved in lymphocyte signal transduction processes. The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA), FK 506, and rapamycin have been studied in particular detail. Two distinct classes of immunosuppressant binding proteins have been identified, and collectively termed immunophilins. The cyclophiin family of immunophiins binds CsA, whereas the FK 506 -binding protein (FKBP) family binds FK 506 and rapamycin. This review will discuss both the endogenous functions of immunophilins as well as their roles in mediating immunosuppression. ...|$|E

Disruption of electrical synapses between adjacent AIIs and between AIIs and ON cone bipolars was demonstrated by intracellular injection of Neurobiotin. In addition, extracellular recording in the knockout revealed the complete elimination of rod-mediated, on-center responses at the ganglion cell level. These data represent direct proof that electrical synapses are critical for the propagation of rod signals across the mammalian retina, and they demonstrate the existence of multiple rod pathways, {{each of which is}} dependent on electrical synapses...|$|E
