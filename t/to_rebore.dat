25|$|In June 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) {{management}} {{announced that}} they have elected not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing {{that it would be}} cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) <b>to</b> <b>rebore</b> a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small likelihood that a train (or two) would crash into or be cut in two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but automated event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).|$|E
50|$|The bimetal bushing, {{which is}} locked into the bore of the chock, {{has a high}} tin Babbitt lining in a steel shell. Loading of the bearing is always vertical, with the load bearing section {{at the top of}} the upper bearing and at the bottom of the lower bearing. The bearing lining is {{undercut}} on the horizontal centerline (the rebore) so that oil entering the bearing is drawn in by the rotation and eccentricity of the journal. Oil is generally supplied <b>to</b> the <b>rebore</b> following the minimum film thickness, then drawn through the unloaded half of the bushing before entering the load zone, where the hydrodynamic oil film and pressure field are formed. The total oil flow is specified to optimize the cooling of the bearing. Oil flow and feed pressure are specified for each individual mill during the design phase and each mill has specific documentation defining these parameters.|$|R
5000|$|During use, the {{cylinder}} {{is subject to}} wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a <b>rebore</b> <b>to</b> an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons. The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top compression ring of the piston, which {{can result in a}} detectable ridge. If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top compression ring to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring. For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally [...] "exercised" [...] through their full speed range to develop a tapered wear profile rather than a sharp ridge.|$|R
