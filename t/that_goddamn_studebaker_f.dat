5000|$|After Duane's death, {{the band}} held {{a meeting on}} their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band {{returned}} to the road. They completed their third studio album, Eat a Peach, that winter, which raised each member's spirits: [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach", said Allman. Eat a Peach was released the following February, and it became the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard album chart. [...] "We’d been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever", Allman recalled. The band purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia, which became a group hangout. Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from {{the death of his}} friend, and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash. [...] "Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry’s pain was finally over", Allman said.The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted Lamar Williams on bass and Chuck Leavell on piano. The band began recording Brothers and Sisters, their follow-up album, and Betts became the group's de facto leader during the recording process. Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled Laid Back. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band. Both albums were released in late 1973, with Brothers and Sisters cementing the Allman Brothers' place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s. [...] "Everything that we'd done before—the touring, the recording—culminated in that one album", Allman recalled. [...] "Ramblin' Man", Betts' country-infused number, rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and gave the band their biggest hit.
