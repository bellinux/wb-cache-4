"X-Cops" [...] {{serves as}} a fictional {{crossover}} with Cops {{and is one of}} only two X-Files episodes to be shot in real time, in which events are presented at the same rate that the audience experiences them. Gilligan, who was inspired to write the script because he enjoyed Cops, pitched the idea several times to series creator Chris Carter and the series writing staff, receiving a mixed reception; when the crew felt that the show was nearing its end with the conclusion of the seventh season, Gilligan was given the green light because it was seen as an experiment. In the tradition of the real-life Cops program, the entire episode was shot on videotape and featured several members of the crew of Cops. The episode has been <b>thematically</b> <b>analyzed</b> for its use of postmodernism and its presentation as reality television.|$|E

40|$|For researchers, policymakers, and {{practitioners}} facing a new field, undertaking a systematic review can typically present a challenge {{due to the}} enormous number of relevant papers. A scoping review is a method suggested for addressing this dilemma; however, scoping reviews present their own challenges. This paper introduces the “scoping meta-review” (SMR) for expanding current methodologies {{and is based on}} our experiences in mapping the field of consumer engagement in healthcare. During this process, we developed the novel SMR method. An SMR combines aspects of a scoping review and a meta-review to establish an evidence-based map of a field. Similar to a scoping review, an SMR offers a practical and flexible methodology. However, unlike in a traditional scoping review, only systematic reviews are included. Stages of the SMR include: undertaking a preliminary nonsystematic review; building a search strategy; interrogating academic literature databases; classifying and excluding studies based on titles and abstracts; saving the refined database of references; revising the search strategy; selecting and reviewing the full text papers; and <b>thematically</b> <b>analyzing</b> the selected texts and writing the report.

40|$|Competitive {{advantages}} of consumer co-operatives have received increasing scholarly attention {{during the recent}} years. In the extant literature, co-operative social capital (derived from the co-operative values, purpose, and principles) {{has been identified as}} a source of competitive advantage for co-operatives. However, the literature lacks empirical evidence concerning how the sources of social capital are developed and utilized in consumer co-operation and what strategic benefits consumer co-operatives achieve by utilizing and developing different sources of social capital. Our paper is directed toward this end. In our study, we <b>thematically</b> <b>analyze</b> 20 qualitative interviews with executives, managers, and supervisory board chairs of Finnish retail and service organization S Group and its co-operatives. Our findings indicate that there are several sources of social capital for consumer co-operatives (e. g. interacting and sharing a common identity). Further,  we consider how these sources of social capital are interrelated to different dimensions of social capital (communal, relational, and cognitive). We also describe the strategic benefits that the different dimensions of social capital create, the most important finding being that social capital may help consumer co-operatives to achieve a sustained competitive advantage by providing resources for managing institutional dependencies and customer-relations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Though {{proactive}} followership {{behavior is}} {{often viewed as}} instrumental to group success, leaders do not always respond favorably to the actions of overly eager followers. Guided by a constructivist perspective, we investigated how interpretations of followership differ across the settings in which acts of leadership and followership emerge. In <b>thematically</b> <b>analyzing</b> data from semi-structured interviews with leaders of high-performing teams, we depict how the construal of follower behaviors relates to various contextual factors underscoring leader-follower interactions. Prototypical characteristics were described in relation to ideal followership (i. e., active independent thought, ability to process self-related information accurately, collective orientation, relational transparency). However, proactive followership behaviors were subject to the situational and relational demands that were salient during leader-follower interactions. Notably, the presence of third party observers, {{the demands of the}} task, stage in the decision making process, suitability of the targeted issue, and relational dynamics influenced which follower behaviors were viewed as appropriate from the leaderâ��s perspective. These findings provide insight into when leaders are more likely to endorse proactive followership, suggesting that proactive followership requires an awareness of how to calibrate oneâ��s actions in accordance with prevailing circumstance...|$|R

40|$|While {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} professional and political focus on the prevalence and harmfulness of child neglect, little has been done to explore what child neglect means outside child protection circles. This qualitative study explores lay constructions of child neglect by <b>thematically</b> <b>analyzing</b> focus group discussions between 46 self-defined ‘lay’ people in England. Participants viewed neglect as extremely damaging for children and as arising when children’s physical, emotional, training and supervisory needs were unmet due to abnormal parental behavior. Children with unmet needs were positioned as deprived, unloved, uncontrolled and escaping. They were only positioned as neglected when failure to meet their needs was attributable to a lack of parental knowledge and skill (clueless parents), a lack of appropriate parental disposition (underinvested parents) or both (unsuitable parents). ‘Normal’ parents – those with the appropriate parental disposition, skills and knowledge – who failed to meet their children’s needs were not seen as neglectful but rather as overburdened. As ‘normal parenting’ has fragmented in late modernity, society wide consensus on child neglect was felt by participants to have retreated to child protection definitions, alienating lay understandings. If child neglect really is ‘everybody’s business’, then it is important that lay people are included in forging new definitions of and responses to meeting the needs of childre...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the success}} of African women’s {{literature}} in disseminating the African Womanist cause, this study examines popular Nigerian women’s lifestyle magazines to ascertain whether and in what ways {{they are able to}} reflect, reinforce or contradict the African feminist agenda. Taking an interdisciplinary approach applying qualitative content analysis from literary studies to the content and feature articles of two Nigerian women’s magazines, this study <b>thematically</b> <b>analyzes</b> discourses and practices of femininity in the Nigerian media. Viewed from the African Womanist perspective, this research illustrates that, contrary to the generalization that representations of women in the media are stereotypical and destructive to women, Nigerian women’s lifestyle magazines construct positive images of femininity. Women are portrayed as actively carving out spaces for more freedom of choice and achievement for themselves in work, marriage and motherhood as well as issues that pertain to gender equality and empowerment. Magazine discourse thus mirrors the African feminist agenda, affirming that women’s sectional media can act as vehicles for the positive identity formation of women. Through the application of methods and paradigms from African women’s literary studies to the media, this research contributes to the current shifts in methodological approaches to feminist media studies and provides an understanding of how the mass media can play a role in women’s empowerment...|$|R
