5|$|Flora {{was stabbed}} by a mysterious figure while scrawling a rape claim that accuses Evelyn's husband Adrian Powell (Tom Irwin). She manages to drag {{herself to the}} pool during a lavish party and falls in. At her funeral, her four maid friends Zoila (Judy Reyes), Valentina (Edy Ganem), Rosie (Dania Ramirez) and Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez) agree not <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> their {{knowledge}} of the infidelity and its circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contained}} {{excerpts of}} {{grand jury testimony}} {{that is supposed to}} be sealed and confidential by law. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> their sources and at one point faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of Victor Conte's lawyers, pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend {{two and a half years}} in jail.|$|E
5|$|Related to privacy, the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{his devotion}} <b>to</b> <b>divulging</b> {{culture in the}} world of music, on May 3, 2007, Vincenzo Manno was honoured with a tribute by the United States Congress, in {{occasion}} of the 40th Anniversary of his career.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, Gibson - an American exile in Vancouver, Canada - was seen as a reclusive figure, who thought the didactic {{inclination}} in novelists anathema and was not prone <b>to</b> <b>divulging</b> {{much in the way of}} personal information in interviews and retrospectives. The documentary was intended to assuage the dearth of knowledge of Gibson's perspectives on self, career and culture and to uncover the hitherto obscured depths of the writer.|$|R

5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says that the family did not wish <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E
5|$|According to the players, {{they refused}} <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> more {{strategic}} material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One {{of the most}} publicised {{of a series of}} betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had been aware of the plans for Operation Chromite, and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may have been moved to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E

5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the students are asked <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming {{out in front of}} his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E
5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
5000|$|Celine Gonzales (Eva Tamargo): (Seasons 1-3) Celine is {{a former}} maid in the Cryer home and ex-friend of Hanna. She was {{originally}} depicted as a casual, relaxed woman, often fostering a friendly, informal atmosphere. She was also depicted as savvy and well-informed, and gossipy, given <b>to</b> <b>divulging</b> useful inside information about life at the Cryer's to Hanna. However, as time passed on and Hanna appeared to become closer to Katheryn and gain favor within the Cryer household, Celine's demeanor changed: she began to take on more jealous, bullying and antagonistic behaviors, largely towards Hanna and later towards Katheryn as well.|$|R
50|$|The Pen Register Statute is a privacy act. As {{there is}} no {{constitutional}} protection for information <b>divulged</b> <b>to</b> a third party under the Supreme Court's expectation of privacy test, and the routing information for phone and internet communications are <b>divulged</b> <b>to</b> the company providing the communication, the absence or inapplicability of the statute would leave the routing information for those communications completely unprotected from government surveillance.|$|R
40|$|In the American states, {{campaign}} finance laws require disclosure of private information for contributors at relatively low thresholds ranging from $ 1 to $ 300. The Internet has made it relatively easy to publicize such information {{in a way that}} changes the social context for political participation. Ray La Raja looks at how public disclosure of campaign contributions affects citizensâ€™ willingness to give money to candidates. Drawing on social influence theory, his analysis suggests that citizens are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>divulging</b> private information, especially those who are surrounded by people with different political views. He shows that individuals refrain from making small campaign contributions or reduce their donations to avoid disclosing their identities...|$|R
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skillsâ€”in the era before DNA profilingâ€”to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E

50|$|Michael {{discusses}} {{the circumstances of}} his forced stay in the hospital, hinting at improper doctor-patient relationships involving him and his supervising doctor, and a bizarre love-hate relationship with the head nurse Susan Peterson. Michael's ploys also include an attempt to negotiate his early release from hospital in return <b>to</b> <b>divulging</b> the circumstances of Dr. Lawrence's disappearance. Dr. Lawrence surfaces alive after the note he left is delivered to Dr. Green, and Michael convinces the investigating doctor to hand him a box of chocolates as reward. Strongly allergic to the nuts in the chocolates, Michael dies {{in the hands of the}} doctor and the head nurse after eating several. Adrenaline shots and resuscitation attempts fail to save Michael's life.|$|R

25|$|Hogg {{was careful}} not <b>to</b> <b>divulge</b> {{potentially}} embarrassing information about Shelley's living friends, however. He also failed to mention his own passion for Harriet Shelley, Percy Shelley's first wife. Harriet was portrayed very favourably in the book, although Hogg did discuss her preoccupation with suicide. Percy's father Timothy Shelley was portrayed very negatively, and the book characterized Percy Shelley as often disdainful towards his parents.|$|E
