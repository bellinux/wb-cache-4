5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E
25|$|In DCF valuations, <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> {{often an}} {{estimate}} of the cost of capital for the business, is used to calculate the net present value of a series of projected cash flows. <b>The</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.|$|E
25|$|A {{discount}} rate or capitalization rate {{is used to}} determine the present value of the expected returns of a business. <b>The</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and capitalization rate are closely related to each other, but distinguishable.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a survey of}} the empirical results associated with testing for a unit root in <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> As suggested by the literature, the use of the historical average of <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in <b>the</b> calculation of the present value of lost future earnings is valid if <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> follows a mean reverting, stationary process. However, if <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> follows a mean averting, non-stationary process forensic economists should perhaps use the current value of <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in such calculations. A majority of the studies surveyed indicate that <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> experienced a structural break in the late 1970 s-early 1980 s. In general, if <b>the</b> net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is stationary {{as a result of a}} structural break, forensic economists should use <b>the</b> average net <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> over <b>the</b> post-break period. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{modelling}} of {{the costs}} and benefits of climate change has renewed debate surrounding assumptions regarding <b>the</b> social <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in analysing <b>the</b> impacts of environmental change.

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to {{the appropriate}} measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate discount rates. <b>The</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
25|$|For an {{interest-bearing}} security, {{coupon rate}} is {{the ratio of}} the annual coupon amount (the coupon paid per year) per unit of par value, whereas current yield is {{the ratio of the}} annual coupon divided by its current market price.

40|$|In {{this study}} we compare <b>the</b> {{subjective}} <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> for Israeli Jews and Arabs. All the subjects were bank customers, who were asked to bid and ask prices for delayed fixed amounts and for lotteries. The two populations {{live in the same}} country under the same laws. Nevertheless, according to the literature, Israeli Arabs seem to be a discriminated minority, who exhibit traits of a traditional collectivist culture, while Israeli Jews are a majority, who exhibit traits of an individualistic culture. As a discriminated minority, Israeli Arab may suffer from lower trust and as a result, according to the "trust" hypothesis, exhibit higher subjective <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and higher risk aversion. On the other hand, according to the “cushion” hypothesis, a collectivist society such as Israeli Arabs, provides a safety net for the individual and as a result, he will exhibit lower subjective <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and lower risk-aversion. The experimental findings show that <b>the</b> subjective <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and risk aversion of Israeli Arabs are significantly higher than that of Israeli Jews. Moreover, higher percent of Israeli Jews are at the low range of <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> (below 10 %) and lower percent of Israeli Jews are at the high range of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (above 20 %) compared to Israeli Arabs. This is consistent with the "trust" hypothesis.

25|$|As a result, {{actuarial science}} {{developed}} along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.|$|E
25|$|The {{time value}} of an option is {{the total value of}} the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> between now and the expiry date. In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E
