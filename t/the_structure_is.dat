5|$|A large table tomb at {{the west}} end of the churchyard is listed {{separately}} by English Heritage as a GradeII-listed structure. Dating from about 1800, it contains the remains of George and Mary Hutchinson. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> of pale (but heavily weathered) stone, including a two-step plinth, with various inscriptions on the sides, topped with a carved urn decorated with putti. The Grade II listing was given on 23February 1983.|$|E
50|$|It is now {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> a farmstead or a hunting lodge, {{which was probably}} constructed sometime during the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> modified extensively sometime before 1902.|$|R

5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity. Both modern crocodilians and birds, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> damaged during <b>the</b> {{earthquake}} of 1783 {{and that}} of 1908. The building's upper floor was largely destroyed during the latter earthquake. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> further damaged by World War II bombings.|$|R

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> probably not {{as large as}} in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
50|$|According to some sources, <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> {{built as}} a triumphal arch to commemorate the Romans' {{victories}} over <b>the</b> Parthians. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> sometimes erroneously referred to as Hadrian's Arch, although emperor Hadrian {{had been dead for}} over half a century when the arch was built.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>structures</b> <b>were</b> {{completed}} in 1280, and have undergone many restorations and losses. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> {{converted into a}} barrack in 1863.

5|$|At the {{entrance}} to the garden, the area closest to the busy roadway intersection, Jensen placed a monumental garden shelter, known as Flower Hall, and a formal reflecting pool. The designer of <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> unknown, however, it was possibly Jensen himself, or his friend, prairie school architect Hugh Garden. East of the building, the garden becomes more naturalistic. Jensen included perennial beds, a lily pool, and unique prairie-style benches. In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed a fieldhouse in Douglas Park. The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Humboldt and LaFolette Park Fieldhouses, and the On Leong Merchants Association Building in Chinatown. In 1934, Douglas Park became part of the Chicago Park District, when the city's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide agency.|$|E
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|Birket Israel (trans. Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, {{abbreviated}} from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans.

5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
5|$|In Tarner Park, {{an area of}} {{open space}} formed from part of number 1 Tilbury Place's grounds, there is a {{circular}} tower which {{is believed to have}} been built by Edward Tilbury Tarner (son of the original occupants Edward and Laetitia Tarner) as an observation tower so he could see ships in the English Channel. The mid-19th-century structure has two storeys and about 70 steps; the upper level is recessed and has a walkway around it. The walls are of knapped flint with some brick and stonework. Part of an iron weather vane remains at the top. Both storeys have segmental-arched entrances, but these are now closed. <b>The</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> in good condition but has some missing flints.|$|E
