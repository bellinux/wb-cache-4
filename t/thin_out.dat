The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots.

5|$|However, Jasmine did not {{maintain}} its peak intensity {{for an extended}} period of time. By 9February, the cloud tops surrounding Jasmine began to warm, and thus weakened. In addition, the cyclone began to enter cooler SSTs. Although Jasmine's convective bands continued to <b>thin</b> <b>out,</b> the cyclone maintained a gradually expanding eyewall and remained a compact system. By 10February, the eyewall of Cyclone Jasmine measured 95km (60mi) in diameter. The next day, the subtropical ridge that had been forcing Jasmine toward the southeast had weakened, and as a result the cyclone began to track east-northeast, toward a weakness in the ridge. The storm continued to disorganize, with its eye later becoming cloud–filled. By the end of 11February, Jasmine had already weakened to a cyclone with wind speeds of just 85km/h (50mph), sustained for one minute, due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. The low–level circulation center of Jasmine became partly exposed for a period of time on 12February, before convection redeveloped over the center. As a weakening cyclone, Jasmine only maintained an area of weak convection displaced to its east as it approached Tonga.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, {{who had been with}} the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, many of his colleagues had enlisted in the armed services and the competition was beginning to <b>thin</b> <b>out</b> during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E

5|$|Only D Company—which {{had been}} holding the summit and had {{withdrawn}} last—was heavily engaged {{and was unable to}} move at the scheduled time. The Chinese launched a determined assault, preceding it with heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, before attempting to overrun the forward pits. Once again the Australians repelled the Chinese assault and Gravener decided to begin to <b>thin</b> <b>out</b> his position before the situation deteriorated further. With one platoon covering their movement, D Company subsequently withdrew, closely pursued by the Chinese. During the rapid withdrawal after the final Chinese attack, Private Keith Gwyther was accidentally left behind after being knocked unconscious and buried in a forward pit by a mortar round. He regained consciousness some hours later and was subsequently captured by the Chinese who had by then occupied Hill 504 and were digging-in. Finally, the Australians succeeded in achieving a clean break after dark, and D Company was able to safely withdraw. By 23:30 the battalion was clear, completing its withdrawal in good order and intact, and suffering only minimal casualties. Regardless, the previous 24 hours of fighting had been costly for the Australians, resulting in 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured; the bulk of them in A Company and Battalion Headquarters. Yet their stout defence had halted the assault on the brigade's right flank, and had inflicted far heavier casualties on the Chinese before being withdrawn. Significantly for the Australians 25 April was Anzac Day; however, following their successful withdrawal the Chinese turned their attention to the Canadians on the left flank.|$|E

25|$|Long draw is spun from a carded rolag. The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to <b>thin</b> <b>out.</b> Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong.

2500|$|Bottleneck rifle {{cartridges}} {{are particularly}} prone to encounter incipient head separations {{if they are}} full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. [...] In some such cartridges, such as the [...]303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 re-loadings can be the limit, before {{the head of the}} cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. [...] The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a [...] "head space gauge". [...] Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle's headspace. [...] Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge {{to the middle of the}} shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. [...] For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when resizing the case. [...] For bolt-action rifles, with their additional camming action, customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when resizing the case. [...] In contrast to full-length resizing of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly <b>thin</b> <b>out</b> the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case that pushes shoulders back only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.|$|E
2500|$|Careful {{cleaning}} of stained glass {{can be a}} very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light. [...] Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000). [...] Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5). [...] The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied deionised water, although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5-6; Vogel et al. 2007, 9-10). [...] Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically <b>thin</b> <b>out</b> these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab. [...] Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA {{can be applied to the}} surface of the glass for long periods of time for “deep, focused cleaning” (Rauch 2004, 6). [...] With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place. [...] In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10). [...] Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).|$|E
