5|$|The opera {{is written}} in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers {{separated}} by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and {{tells the story of}} the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous matador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} interview, Borges also criticized famed Marxist poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, who was {{abducted}} by Nationalist soldiers and executed without trial during the Spanish Civil War.

25|$|Many {{times it}} is the ballad that the child learns first, no Mother Goose melodies are as familiar, and it is strange indeed {{to listen to a}} little tot singing of the courtly days of old, the knights and 'ladyes' and {{probably}} the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of the lover.|$|E

To prove the orphans had received the money, the young doctor sent back the children's fingerprints.|$|E
25|$|Isabella's parents started raising Ricky {{and took}} him to see his mentally ill mother from time to time until she checked out {{completely}} from reality and started becoming violent. Ricky suffered from this experience and also felt abandoned by his father. When Ricky returned to Genoa City nine years later and grown up, Paul and Christine recalled all that Isabella had done. Paul then went to see Isabella following Ricky's <b>tragic</b> <b>death,</b> in which Paul shot him to stop him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). However, Isabella's face was not shown and she was only seen brushing her hair while humming from the back.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the long}} headship of Logie Bruce Lockhart (1955–1982), {{there was a}} further period of change and expansion. Kenwyn, a new Junior School House, was built and opened in 1958.

Tallis, a new boys' house named after John Tallis, Master of the school for {{more than thirty years}} {{in the first half of}} the seventeenth century, was built and opened in 1963 as were the biology classrooms and music rooms.

25|$|Goldmark's {{interest}} in the subject of the Queen of Sheba was inspired by his pupil, mezzo-soprano Caroline von Gomperz-Bettelheim, whose beauty was once compared to that of the Queen of Sheba by a friend of Goldmark. Bettelheim possessed a striking voice and the role was written to show off her wide range and dramatic skills. However, Bettelheim never performed the role, as the opera took twelve years {{to make it to the}} stage. Goldmark began working on the opera in 1863, but the first working libretto proved unsuitable. Mosenthal's libretto was provided two years later, but Goldmark was not satisfied with the happy ending. After some deliberation, Goldmark rewrote the ending of the opera to finish with the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of Assad.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th {{century the}} Ottoman Empire had {{advanced}} all over Southeastern Europe, eventually conquering the Byzantine Empire and extending control over the Balkan states. Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East, and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries. After the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans, the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi, who became Hungary's regent-governor (1446–1453). Hunyadi was {{considered one of the most}} relevant military figures of the 15th century: Pope Pius II awarded him the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Vinul de viață lungă is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Cocea's main work as a novelist. The main character, Manole Arcaș, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arcaș is an atheist with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a utopian socialist who has been turning his estate into a commune. Having reached a venerable age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity in conversations with the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arcaș estate produces a special sort of Moldavian wine; the grapes were pressed by Manole and a Romani (Gypsy) girl, {{in the course of their}} love-making. The object of Arcaș' olfactory fetish, the girl has died a <b>tragic</b> <b>death,</b> inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.|$|E
50|$|The Absolutely True Diary is {{controversial}} for its discussion of alcohol, poverty, bullying, violence, and sexuality, {{as well as}} for the <b>tragic</b> <b>deaths</b> of characters and for the use of profanity and slurs related to homosexuality and mental disability.

25|$|In 1925, Rachmaninoff founded TAIR, a {{publishing}} company named after his daughters, in Paris that specialised in works {{by himself and}} other Russian composers, following the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of the husband of his daughter Tatiana. 1926 marked his return to composition in a considerable time and his Piano Concerto No. 4 was completed {{in the following year}} along with Three Russian Songs, which he dedicated to Leopold Stokowski. In 1929, conductor and music publisher Serge Koussevitzky asked Rachmaninoff if he would select pieces from his Études-Tableaux for Italian composer Ottorino Respighi to orchestrate. Rachmaninoff agreed, giving Respighi five pieces from Études-Tableaux, Op. 33 (1911) and Études-Tableaux, Op. 39 (1917) and the inspirations behind the compositions, something that he did not previously reveal. Respighi, however, titled each piece from the clues Rachmaninoff gave him and completed the orchestrations in 1930. During his summers from 1929 to 1931, Rachmaninoff spent his time in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines near Rambouillet, France, meeting with fellow Russian emigres there.|$|E

A contingent of police approaching on Des Plaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley. The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of 'May Day' labor rallies in many cities." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the <b>tragic</b> <b>death</b> of my colleague...

This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
