Audio and video can also be transmitted through JXTA. The use of mobile streaming mechanism {{with the support of}} mobile hospital management and healthcare system would enable better interaction between doctors, nurses, and the hospital. Experimental results demonstrate good performance in comparison with conventional systems. This study evaluates P 2 P JXTA/JXME (JXTA functionality to MIDP devices.) which facilitates peer-to-peer application+ using mobile-constraint devices. Also a proven learning algorithm was used to automatically send and process sorted patient data to nurses. MethodsFrom December 2010 to December 2011, a total of 500 patients were referred to our hospital due to minor health problems and were monitored. We selected all of <b>the</b> <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and <b>the</b> control server, which controlled the BMO (Block Medical Officer) <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and BMO through <b>the</b> doctor <b>peer</b> <b>groups,</b> and prescriptions were delivered to the patient’s mobile phones through the JXTA/JXME network.

40|$|Introduction: The Environmental {{social factors}} such as <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports {{increase}} individual enjoyment andhelp them toevolve. <b>Peer</b> <b>groups,</b> physical activities, and sports might be effective factors on accelerating teenagers and youth socialization andpsycho-social evolution. University and school {{play an important role}} in joining <b>the</b> students into <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sport teamsand as a dynamic factor in social development and evolution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the students’ points of view of <b>the</b> effect of <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports on education and training process. Methods: This analyticalcross-sectional study wasperformed on 406 Yazd University students in 2010 - 2011 academic year. The students were selected using stratified random sampling and completed a researcher-made questionnaire with a Cronbach Alpha of 82. 7 %. Descriptive statistics such as mean, medium and standard deviation were calculated and Chi Square, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, and one-Way ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Resalts: The results, statistically significant, indicated that 88 % of <b>the</b> students considered <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and 78. 2 % considered sports as highly effective factorson education and training process (p≤ 0. 01). Among the demographic variables, only the marital status had a significant relationship with <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports. Also mother’s occupation had a significant relationship with <b>peer</b> <b>groups.</b> There was no significant relationship between other variables and the mentioned social variables.
