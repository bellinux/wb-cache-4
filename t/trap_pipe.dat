40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{functions}} of the two synergistic pheromone components, (4 s) -cis-verbenol (cV) and 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 - 01 (MB), {{and the role of}} ipsdienol in the attraction of Ips typographus (L.) (Scolytidae) to pheromone sources were studied in the field. Absolute and relative beetle catches were compared between several traps placed at and nearby a central pheromone source: a <b>pipe</b> <b>trap</b> containing the source, a surrounding sticky trap, a nearby window trap, and four distant window traps. A higher catch in the outer down-wind distant traps indicated an up-wind anemotaxis to the source. Increased MB release, with cV constant, increased the proportion caught in the central <b>pipe</b> <b>trap,</b> indicating MB as a landing stimulus. Release of MB alone gave a very small catch. Ipsdienol could not substitute for cV in the synergism with MB. An increase of cV, with MB constant, increased the number of beetles caught, but not the proportion caught in the <b>pipe</b> <b>trap.</b> The sex ratio was equal in the window traps, but fell to 30 % males in both sticky and <b>pipe</b> <b>traps,</b> showing that {{a large proportion of the}} males attracted to the source did not land. The proportion of males in the <b>pipe</b> <b>trap</b> was reduced at the highest cV dose.

Saproxylic beetle numbers increased greatly from the first year to the second year on all treatments. Species richness and total abundance of Coleoptera were not significantly affected by the treatments, but several families (e. g., Elateridae, Cleridae, Trogositidae, Scolytidae) were significantly more abundant on treated plots.

This happened because the drill pipe elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the drill pipe during loss of well control, consequently, drill pipe in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>trapped</b> between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|R

We have conducted the following experimental and theoretical investigations in order to optimize the LSC's performance. The spectral characteristics of 18 organic laser dyes are studied for their applicability as luminescing centers. The spectral homogeneity and self-absorption characteristics of representative dyes are examined in detail. The relative spectral homogeneity of such dyes is shown to depend upon the surrounding material using narrow band laser excitation. We develop three independent techniques for measuring self-absorption rates; these are time-resolved emission, steady state polarization anisotropy, and spectral convolution. Prototype devices are tested for performance, and the componant dyes are tested for stability to solar exposure. A model is developed which predicts the efficiency and gain of and LSC from the spectroscopic characteristics of its components. A critical optical density (CODE) is assigned to the dyes surveyed which predicts the self-absorption limited performance for a particular dye. The maximum efficiency of an LSC is found using a simple model and the experimentally measured Stokes shift required to minimize self-absorption. We find that the performance of LSCs which achieve high light concentration is primarily limited by self-absorption and by photodegradation. The maximum efficiency possible is about 9 % in such systems, and present devices can achieve about 3 %.

We distributed 288 PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>traps</b> equally among treatments and monitored traps from mid-June continuing until the first hard frost. Treefrogs used all forest treatments but sex and age composition differed significantly between forested and clearcut treatments. Fewer adult females were captured within clearcuts than in forested plots whereas adult males were captured at similar frequencies in both forested and clearcut plots. Metamorphs were first captured in mid-July with increasing frequency in the following weeks and were captured more frequently in clearcuts than in forested plots. Greater frequencies of captures were recorded {{for each of the}} sex and age classes in clearcuts with high CWD compared to clearcuts with low CWD. Equal or greater frequencies of captures were recorded for adult and metamorph treefrogs in partial harvest treatments compared to control plots. Our results indicate that timber harvest may alter habitat use associated with reproduction. Males benefit by using clearcut habitat and having access to breeding pools preferred by females for oviposition. Females benefit by having access to forest habitat shown to be essential for feeding and energy intake. Gray treefrogs thrived in small clearcuts because the small plot size provided accessibility to uncut forests.

40|$|The Fielding Ditch Company Pipeline {{is almost}} 3 {{miles long and}} {{supplies}} irrigation water under low pressure to adjacent fields through 33 turnouts along its length. The 24 -inch non-reinforced concrete pipeline began to experience repeated structural failures soon after it was placed in operation. This study was done for the Soil Conservation Service by the Utah Water Research Laboratory to gather field data on the pipeline operating characteristics, to analyze the hydraulic transients in the pipeline {{with the help of}} a computer simulation model, and to suggest modification to protect the pipeline from future failures caused by transient pressures. Following a description of the pipeline system, the concepts and principles of unsteady flow in pipelines are summarized. Then the general equations for transient flow are presented followed by a summary of their solution using numerical methods. Under the field verification data collection program, instruments and recorders were set up at four locations along the pipeline. Pressure and flow measurements during both steady and unsteady flows were recorded to obtain data on the operating characteristics of the pipeline. These field data as well as preliminary analysis indicate that moderate closure times of valves could generate pressure waves which could overstress the non-reinforced concrete pipe. The field data also provided a way to verify that the computer simulation model could truly represent the behavior of the actual pipeline system. The field data also shoed the pressure wave speed to be about 1170 feet per second rather than 3640 feet per second predicted by the wave speed equations. This significant change in wave speed was attributed to the effect of free air <b>trapped</b> in <b>pipe</b> joints and high spots in the pipeline. Seven increasingly complex computer models were developed to represent the pipeline. The first was a simple basic water hammer program for a pipe with a reservoir upstream and a valve at the downstream end which could close instantly. Later programs added the effects of air pockets along the pipeline, damping or dissipation at the air pockets, gradual closure of the downstream valve, gradual closure of a valve at an interior point, simultaneous closure of two valves and provision for protective standpipes at any or all interior valve locations. Comparisons of the final programs with field data showed the system to be adequately represented. The computer programs were then used to compare the effectiveness of various proposed protective modifications to the pipeline. Modifications considered but not recommended included requiring a longer valve closure time (not fail safe), installation of pressure relief valves (not reliable), and installation of air chambers at each valve (not economical). The recommended pipeline modification was to install eleven 18 -inch pressure relief standpipes at selected interior turnout locations and one 36 -inch standpipe at the downstream end. The study showed that the spillage at the standpipes to an acceptable amount.
