25|$|A <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{count up}} valence {{electrons}}, then count up {{the number of}} electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers {{and the answer is}} the number of electrons that make up the bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms' octets.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{cool the}} {{building}}'s thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps {{to be able}} to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E

25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but at least there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E

In genre fiction Iain Banks, writing as Iain M. Banks, produced ground-breaking science fiction. Scottish crime fiction, known as Tartan Noir, {{has been a major}} area of growth with the success of novelists including Frederic Lindsay (1933–2013), Quintin Jardine (b. 1945), Val McDermid (b. 1955), Denise Mina (b. 1966), Christopher Brookmyre (b. 1968), and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin (b. 1960) and his Inspector Rebus novels.

500|$|In a 1990 paper, [...] "Elephants Don't Play Chess," [...] {{robotics}} researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at {{the physical}} symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since [...] "the world is its own best model.

[...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E

[...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown {{in the middle of a}} squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the episode Ford {{describes}} it as [...] "an all out romp" [...] and an [...] "action, rollercoaster ride" [...] with [...] "a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters". Davies stated that [...] "the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh". Expanding on the comedic aspects, something Ford considered whilst writing the episode was that [...] "the <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have the comedy come out of the characters" [...] rather than the scenario itself. It was Eve Myles' idea to have Gwen compulsively eat gherkins after waking up pregnant; the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water. The episode also plays on Gwen's conflicted feelings between Jack and Rhys. Davies felt it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to have the wedding temporarily halted by [...] "the one man Rhys doesn't want to see running down the aisle." [...] Ford stated that whilst Jack is [...] "the series hero" [...] Rhys is [...] "the hero of this episode". He compares a sequence where Rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend Gwen to the character being in [...] "Evil Dead mode". [...] Producer Richard Stokes commented that the episode illuminated that [...] "even though 's put [...] through some really difficult times, she really does love him and want to be with him." [...] In an early draft of the script Gwen and Rhys had their memories wiped {{at the end of the}} episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by Jack that the wedding had been problem free.|$|E

50|$|To {{calculate}} the accelerations the gravitational attraction of each body {{on each other}} body <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account.

To increase the accuracy of the simulation not only more decimals <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken but also smaller timesteps, again quickly increasing the amount of work.

2500|$|Now {{a note on}} the grotesque: Among {{all these}} [...] "fauves"—the name given to the Impressionists in {{conventional}} workshops—the most [...] "fauve" [...] of all is certainly Jean Metzinger, the defender of Cubism. Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how [...] "Cubism" [...] proceeds. Under the title of Nu , Jean Metzinger shows us [...] "cubes" [...] of various tones, but of the same color.

2500|$|Most {{methods of}} {{phishing}} use {{some form of}} technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear {{to belong to the}} spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will take you to the example section of the yourbank website; actually this URL points to the [...] "yourbank" [...] (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make the displayed text for a link (the text between the [...] tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher. Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview feature.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{spending}} on disease prevention is often suggested {{as a way}} of reducing health care spending. Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention. Childhood vaccinations, or contraceptives save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings. Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective. [...] Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life. On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are the ones who have invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.|$|E
2500|$|With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino {{returned}} {{to the notion of}} a trilogy film: [...] "I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story." [...] Tarantino explains that the idea [...] "was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories— the oldest stories in the book... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'— the oldest story about... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times." [...] "I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry", he says. [...] "Part of the <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel." [...] In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: [...] "I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [...] I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk".|$|E
