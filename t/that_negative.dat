Though <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the Stasi or the KGB in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US-backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet-backed Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser).|$|E
25|$|Both general {{relativity}} and Newtonian gravity appear to predict <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> mass {{would produce a}} repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir Hermann Bondi proposed in 1957 <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the strong equivalence principle of {{general relativity}} theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi's proof yielded singularity free solutions for the relativity equations. In July 1988, Robert L. Forward presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative gravitational mass propulsion system.|$|E

He contends <b>that</b> <b>negatives</b> are purely a characteristic of symbol systems, which he has already determined belong uniquely to man. He further refers to morality as being particularly human and based largely {{on the idea of}} negatives; that is, there are things we should not do. [...] Intrinsic to this portion of Burke's Definition is the idea of paradox. Burke explains that the idea of negation is, by its nature, paradoxical. He explains that conditioning a statement with a negative draws a positive image of that very statement. This, he argues, defeats the purpose of negation, yet is an inescapable situation.|$|R

Importantly, Soka Gakkai members believe effects are determined simultaneously with causes, though they remain latent until the right external influences bring them to fruition. Soka Gakkai Buddhism teaches that even the most stubborn karma can be overcome as one reveals one's Buddha nature in this lifetime. Thus, karma becomes a source of hope and mission rather than despair.|$|E

When at operating temperature, if the temperature of the water increases, its density drops, and fewer neutrons passing through it are slowed enough to trigger further reactions. <b>That</b> <b>negative</b> feedback stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, these types can use natural uranium/unenriched fuel.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> priming effects {{have been found to}} be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, {{additionally}} {{to smoking}} bans in public buildings and transports, an anti-smoking ordinance for {{bars and restaurants}} was implemented in late 2007. A study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) demonstrates, that the smoking ban had, if any, only short run impacts on bar and restaurant revenues. In the medium and long run no negative effect was measurable. The results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is {{characterized}} by the belief <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.|$|E
25|$|As the city's {{most visible}} landmark, the {{building}} was controversial from its inception. Many Poles initially hated the building because they considered {{it to be a}} symbol of Soviet domination, and at least some of <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> feeling persists today. Some have also argued that, regardless of its political connotations, the building destroyed the aesthetic balance of the old city and imposed dissonance with other buildings. This contrast has been lessened somewhat over the years with the construction of several skyscrapers in the vicinity. Despite the controversies, the Palace became an internationally recognized symbol of Warsaw.|$|E

The data were collected again a year later. Results show a year later <b>that</b> <b>negative</b> discipline is correlated with child aggression, but only when that mother is insensitive.|$|E
