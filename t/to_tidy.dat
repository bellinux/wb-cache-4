25|$|The {{boundary}} of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of Westminster, Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets. The main purpose of these changes was <b>to</b> <b>tidy</b> up the boundary {{where it had been}} rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) Broadgate estate entirely in the City.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "loose story" [...] of [...] "Tom and Gerri" [...] {{was written}} {{originally}} as a two-hour play while Shearsmith and Pemberton {{were on the}} dole and sharing a flat, prior {{to the production of}} League of Gentlemen. The story was inspired by their experiences in this environment. The character of Tom has his [...] "life energy" [...] drained in the same way that, the writers suggest, is experienced by jobhunters. The [...] "sinister" [...] atmosphere of the episode is meant to evoke the feeling that a person has when they [...] "can't quite manage to leave the flat" [...] and they [...] "can't be bothered <b>to</b> <b>tidy</b> up". [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] ended up [...] "quite different" [...] from the play, which featured a character much like Pauline from The League of Gentlemen. Pemberton described the feel of the episode as Pinteresque, comparing it to Harold Pinter's A Slight Ache. This sentiment was echoed by critic Gareth Lightfoot, writing in Teesside's Evening Gazette.|$|E
