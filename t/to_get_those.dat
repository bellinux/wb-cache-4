Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has [...] "put a lot of work" [...] into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons. She has said that she only feels nervous performing [...] "if I'm {{not sure what the}} audience thinks of me, like at award shows".|$|E
500|$|Sunderland had a poor {{start to}} the month, as they lost 3–0 away to Liverpool on 2 February. They had two penalty appeals turned down, {{prompting}} Roy Keane to comment, [...] "We felt they were penalties. But I didn't feel we were going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those</b> decisions today." [...] Following a recent heart attack in a League Cup game between Leicester City and Nottingham Forest, Clive Clarke had his Sunderland contract terminated on 5 February due to the event while on loan at Leicester.

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those,</b> so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those</b> truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the usual}} pattern of {{alternating}} sea duty with service ashore, Burroughs's next assignment was the aviation {{desk at the}} Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, D.C., in March 1943.

2500|$|In 1971, {{the group}} rented Clearwell Castle, in Gloucestershire, living and {{recording}} there. They finished recording their third album, again with Emerick as producer, but the tapes {{were once again}} rejected by Apple, because Apple felt that Badfinger needed a producer who could bring a more polished sound to the recordings. [...] Thus, George Harrison himself took over as producer in spring of 1971, including Leon Russell and Klaus Voormann in the sessions as well. [...] Commenting on the recording of the dual slide guitars on [...] "Day After Day", Molland remembered: [...] "Pete and I had done the backing track, and George came {{in the studio and}} asked if we'd mind if he played ... It took hours, and hours, and hours, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those</b> two guitars in sync". [...] However, Harrison stopped the sessions after recording just four songs because of his commitments to The Concert for Bangladesh, which Harrison included Badfinger in as well. [...] After the concert, Harrison was tied up with producing the tapes from that concert, and so was unable to resume with Badfinger. [...] Instead, the Badfinger album was completed by Todd Rundgren, who mixed the tapes from the Harrison sessions, re-recorded the songs from the Emerick sessions, and also produced some newer, previously unrecorded songs.|$|E
2500|$|At the Senate rostrum, Bujor {{suggested}} that no military operation was possible before sorting out [...] "social inequities", as Romania's strength depended on peasant recruits. He debated {{the issue with}} the Prime Minister, his old friend Brătianu, who responded that the proposed social reforms were inopportune. In 1916, Romania, under Brătianu's PNL government, entered {{the war against the}} Central Powers; by 1917, its territory had been invaded, with only Western Moldavia still under control. The cabinet and both chambers of Parliament relocated to Iași. By April–May 1917, senator Bujor was an ally of the opposition Labor Party and of breakaway Conservative Democrats, calling for more progressive policies than the National Liberals offered. During those months, he joined a parliamentary commission on land reform—although, as PNL man Ion G. Duca notes, these were dominated [...] "by the great landowners, since Brătianu's goal was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those</b> most affected by the reforms to support them as well." [...] On May 30, he signed up to a list of demands formulated by the Conservative Democrat dissidents Ion C. Grădișteanu and Constantin Argetoianu, which argued that the PNL's plan to enact reforms was [...] "political diversion", one meant to cover Brătianu's contribution to the [...] "national disaster". Duca found this oratory [...] "of no interest at all", simply dismissing Bujor as the [...] "untalented and irrelevant" [...] version of Matei B. Cantacuzino. In the end, Bujor was not among the five senators who voted against reforms as proposed by Brătianu.|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Weaver retired {{the side}} in order, and the Cardinals {{went to the}} ninth, three outs away from their first World Series title in 24 years. The man called on <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>those</b> three outs would be Adam Wainwright, who had won the job of closer after the star free agent brought to St. Louis in 2002, Jason Isringhausen, had season-ending surgery. Detroit's {{clean-up}} hitter, Magglio Ordóñez, led off the inning. He proceeded to work a full count but then grounded out. The second batter, Sean Casey, worked a full count and then doubled to bring the tying run to the plate. The third batter, Iván Rodríguez, got ahead in the count 2–0 but grounded back to Wainwright on the next pitch, putting the Cardinals one out away. The fourth batter, Plácido Polanco, fell behind 1–2, but then worked a walk to put the tying run on. The fifth batter, Brandon Inge, fell behind 0–2, again putting the Cardinals one strike from a World Series championship. He did not extend the drama any longer, as he swung and missed at the next pitch (making it the first World Series to end on a strikeout since the 1988 World Series), giving the World Series title to the Cardinals. The final play of the 2006 season was made at 10:26pm Central Standard time. [...] After the game, Wainwright, who threw a curveball for strike three to win the pennant and a slider to Inge to win the Series, said [...] "I'll probably never throw another curve or slider again without thinking of those two pitches." ...|$|E

After New York and Pennsylvania were hit by Hurricane Agnes in 1972, which destroyed almost all of the EL mainline west of Binghamton, NY and following the bankruptcy of numerous northeastern U.S. railroads in the 1970s, including D and E-L, N lost control of Dereco stock. After several merger plans fell through, EL petitioned for and was included {{in the formation of the}} federal government's nascent Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). While D was technically still owned by N, they were given enough financial support and told to [...] "sink or swim" [...] as an independent railroad again. In 1980, Conrail sold the former DL Mainline from Binghamton to Scranton to the D Being a flatter more direct route to Scranton, this allowed the D to abandon their famed Penn Division between Carbondale and the connection with the ex-Erie/EL at Jefferson Junction. [...] The reason the D was left out of Conrail was to maintain a semblance of competition in the northeast. [...] While the success of this move has often been discredited since the D was simply too small to compete with all of the markets served by Conrail, the railroad doubled in size by being granted trackage rights over Conrail reaching Newark, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Washington, D.C. The remainder of the Penn Division from Lanesboro, Pennsylvania, to Nineveh, New York, was abandoned after the Belden Hill tunnel was enlarged in 1986.|$|E
