50|$|The {{observation}} of the ten-fold diffraction pattern lay unexplained for two years until the spring of 1984, when Blech asked Shechtman to show him his results again. A quick study of Shechtman's {{results showed that the}} common explanation for a ten-fold symmetrical diffraction pattern, the existence of twins, was ruled out by his experiments. Since periodicity and twins were ruled out, Blech, unaware of the two-dimensional <b>tiling</b> <b>work,</b> was looking for another possibility: a completely new structure containing cells connected to each other by defined angles and distances but without translational periodicity. Blech decided to use a computer simulation to calculate the diffraction intensity from a cluster of such a material without long-range translational order but still not random. He termed this new structure multiple polyhedral.|$|E

50|$|A {{particular}} instantiation of grassroots {{politics in}} the American Civil Rights Movement was the 1951 case of William Van Til working on integration of the Nashville Public Schools. Van <b>Til</b> <b>worked</b> to create a grassroots movement focused on discussing race relations at the local level. To that end, he founded the Nashville Community Relations Conference, which brought together leadership from various communities in Nashville to discuss the possibility of integration. In response to his attempts to network with leadership in the black community, residents of Nashville responded with violence and scare tactics. However, Van Til {{was still able to}} bring blacks and whites together to discuss the potential for changing race relations, and he was ultimately instrumental in integrating the Peabody College of Education in Nashville. Furthermore, the desegregation plan proposed by Van Til's Conference was implemented by Nashville schools in 1957. This movement is characterized as grassroots because it focused on changing a norm at the local level using local power. Van <b>Til</b> <b>worked</b> with local organizations to foster political dialogue, and was ultimately successful.|$|R

Our new method allows for automatic and efficient synthesis {{of a wide range of}} near-regular textures preserving their regular structures and faithfully reproducing their stochastic elements...|$|R

40|$|We compare {{two methods}} for entropy coding uniformly {{quantized}} wavelet coefficients: windowing,which uses local statistics {{to adapt the}} probability assignment and best tiling, which aims to compress {{as well as the}} best tiling of a subband with rectangular tiles of probability models. We find that on some synthetic images, the best <b>tiling</b> method <b>works</b> considerably better than windowing, but on a set of natural images, the improvement provided by the best tiling method over windowing is very small. 1 Introduction Wavelet coefficients are known to be large around edges and small in smooth regions of an image. For effective compression of these coefficients, it is desirable to use different probability models for different regions of a wavelet subband. In this paper, we compare the performance of two sequential probability assignment methods which are able to adapt the probability assignment to the region which is being coded.

Still, parallel architectures such as the graphics processing unit (GPU) do not exploit the potential of data-locality enabled by this independence. Therefore, programmers are required to manually perform data-locality optimisations such as memory coalescing or loop <b>tiling.</b> This <b>work</b> makes a case for locality-aware thread scheduling: re-ordering threads automatically for better locality to improve the programmability of multi-threaded processors. In particular, we analyse the potential of locality-aware thread scheduling for GPUs, considering among others cache performance, memory coalescing and bank locality. This work does not present an implementation of a locality-aware thread scheduler, but rather introduces the concept and identifies the potential. We conclude that non-optimised programs {{have the potential to}} achieve good cache and memory utilisation when using a smarter thread scheduler.

40|$|Abstract. We {{define and}} exemplify the continuations and the fast basin of an attractor of an IFS. Then we extend the {{standard}} symbolic IFS theory, concerning {{the dynamics of}} a contractive IFS on its attractor, to a symbolic description {{of the dynamics of}} a invertible IFS on a set that contains the fast basin of a point-fibred attractor. We use this description to define the fractal manifold, a new topological invariant, associated with a point-fibred attractor of the IFS. We establish relationships between the fractal manifold, the fast basin, and the set of continuations of an attractor of an IFS. We establish how sections of projections, from code space to an attractor, can be extended to yield sections of projections from code space to the f-manifold and to the basin. We use these sections to construct transformations between fractal manifolds and show how their projections extend fractal transformations between at-tractors to corresponding transformations between fast basins of attractors. We present practical conditions that control the topological properties, such as continuity, of these transformations. In the ”just-touching ” case, we show how a section of a projection from code space to an attractor yields a unique address for each point on the fractal manifold, and how the set of addresses provides a tiling of the manifold that project to diverse tilings of the basin. Many standard tilings, and schemes for describing them, as well as an abun-dance of new tilings, result from this new unified approach to fractal <b>tiling.</b> This <b>work</b> has implications to coding theory and numeration systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|On modern computers, the {{performance}} of programs is often limited by memory latency rather than by processor cycle time. To reduce the impact of memory latency, the restructuring compiler community has developed locality-enhancing program transformations such as loop permutation and <b>tiling.</b> These transformations <b>work</b> well for perfectly nested loops (loops in which all assignment statements are contained in the innermost loop), but their performance on codes such as matrix factorizations that contain imperfectly nested loops leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach called data-centric transformation. Instead of reasoning directly about the control structure of the program, a compiler using the data-centric approach chooses an order {{for the arrival of}} data elements in the cache, determines what computations should be performed when that data arrives, and generates the appropriate code.

40|$|Heterogeneous cell populations form an {{interconnected}} network that determine their collective output. One {{example of such}} a heterogeneous immune population is tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), whose output can be measured in terms of its reactivity against tumors. While the degree of reactivity varies considerably between different TILs, ranging from null to a potent response, the underlying network that governs the reactivity is poorly understood. Here, we asked whether one can predict and even control this reactivity. To address this we measured the subpopulation compositions of 91 TILs surgically removed from 27 metastatic melanoma patients. Despite the large number of subpopulations compositions, we were able to computationally extract a simple set of subpopulation-based rules that accurately predict the degree of reactivity. This raised the conjecture of whether one could control reactivity of TILs by manipulating their subpopulation composition. Remarkably, by rationally enriching and depleting selected subsets of subpopulations, we were able to restore anti-tumor reactivity to nonreactive <b>TILs.</b> Altogether, this <b>work</b> describes a general framework for predicting and controlling the output of a cell mixture...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} in the properties of quantum systems, whose classical dynamics are chaotic, derives from their abundance in nature. The spectrum of such systems can be related, in the semiclassical approximation (SCA), to the unstable classical periodic orbits, through Gutzwiller's trace formula. The class of systems studied in this <b>work,</b> <b>tiling</b> billiards on the pseudo-sphere, is special in this correspondence being exact, via Selberg's trace formula. In this work, an exact expression for Green's function (GF) and the eigenfunctions (EF) of tiling billiards on the pseudo-sphere, whose classical dynamics are chaotic, is derived. GF is shown to be equal to the quotient of two infinite sums over periodic orbits, where the denominator is the spectral determinant. Such a result {{is known to be}} true for typical chaotic systems, in the leading SCA. From the exact expression for GF, individual EF can be identified.

30|$|Given {{his broad}} {{knowledge}} and {{deep understanding of}} metallic structures and the intensive effort he devoted {{to the study of}} the phase transitions of metallic glasses through a series of metastable phases, it came as no surprise, that Professor Kuo’s team quickly made many discoveries, particularly in quasicrystal research. In intermetallic compounds, metal atoms often form clusters with slightly distorted symmetry from ideal icosahedral packing, such as the Laves, σ, µ, H and C phases, collectively called the Frank-Kasper phases. In these structures, the individual structural unit is actually composed of a distorted icosahedral cluster (pentagonal antiprism) arranged into a column along a five-fold axis. As a result, in a heavily faulted structure of these phases, the electron diffraction pattern will instead exhibit more characteristics of the individual topological unit, and distinct features reflecting the structure of icosahedral clusters, i.e., five-fold symmetry, should appear. Indeed, it was soon observed in heavily faulted alloys with nano-domains of the Frank-Kasper phases that an electron diffraction pattern with apparent ten-fold symmetry was present (Ye et al., 1984). In another investigation conducted in parallel examining the crystallization of metallic glasses in a (Ti 0.9 V 0.1) 2 Ni alloy, Ze Zhang, his doctoral student who at the time worked with him and Professor Heng-Qiang Ye, soon obtained electron diffraction patterns displaying icosahedral symmetry and high resolution TEM images of the samples that directly resembled quasi-periodic Penrose <b>tiling.</b> This <b>work</b> announced the discovery of quasicrystals in the Ni-Ti alloy, a totally new metallic system (Zhang et al., 1985). In the meantime, Professor Kuo’s team also demonstrated side by side the fundamental differences in atomic structure from five-fold twinning that could result in an electron diffraction pattern with apparent ten-fold symmetry (Jiang et al., 1985). The entire project was carried out independently from the results published in Physical Review Letters only a few months earlier reporting the identification of icosahedral quasicrystals in an Al-Mn alloy with five-fold symmetry that is “forbidden” in classical crystallography (Shechtman et al., 1984), a discovery that revolutionized crystallography and later won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|R
