2500|$|Since capacitors' {{energy content}} {{increases}} with {{the square of}} the voltage, researchers were {{looking for a way to}} increase the electrolyte's breakdown voltage.

These capacitors combine features of electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors. They combine the high dielectric strength of an anode from an electrolytic capacitor with the high capacitance of a pseudocapacitive metal oxide (ruthenium (IV) oxide) cathode from an electrochemical capacitor, yielding a hybrid electrochemical capacitor.

2500|$|A <b>tantalum</b> <b>{{electrolytic}}</b> <b>capacitor,</b> {{a member}} of the family of electrolytic capacitors, [...] is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) is made of tantalum on which a very thin insulating oxide layer is formed, which acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A solid or liquid electrolyte which covers the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second, cathode electrode (−) of the capacitor. Because of its very thin and relatively high permittivity dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high capacitance per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.|$|E
