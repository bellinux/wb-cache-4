5|$|In 1998, {{the band}} {{recorded}} a demo tape on Compact Cassette which they sent to record {{companies in the}} hope of getting a recording contract. The <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> considered rarities.|$|E
5|$|The {{tapes were}} {{originally}} {{described as having}} been recorded {{in the spring of}} 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone. However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962, and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited. Later researchers have proposed that the <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> from multiple days during the last week of December; Allan Williams (The Beatles' booking agent at the time) recalled that a total of about three hours was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day.|$|E
50|$|Water-activated <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} closing and sealing boxes. Before closing {{corrugated}} fiberboard boxes, the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> wetted or remoistened, activated by water. The <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> mostly 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide.|$|R
50|$|Mamie <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a Chinese American {{immigrant}} born in San Francisco. Her parents, Joseph Tape (1852-1935), and Mary McGladery <b>Tape</b> (1857-1934), <b>were</b> both {{immigrants from}} China. Joseph <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a businessman and an interpreter for the Chinese consulate, while Mary <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> an amateur photographer and artist.|$|R
5000|$|Drafting <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> nearly {{identical}} to [...] "masking tape" [...] and [...] "painters tape", the main difference <b>is</b> width. Painters <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> the widest, averaging about 2½ inches(approx. 6.4 cm), while masking tape and drafting <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> {{less than half that}} width.|$|R
5|$|VHS {{tapes of}} Animaniacs were {{released}} in the United States and in the United Kingdom. All of these <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> out of production, but are still available at online sellers. The episodes featured are jumbled at random and are in no particular order with the series. Each video featured four to five episodes each and accompanied {{by a handful of}} shorter skits, with a running time of about 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
25|$|There {{is outside}} chance on Hansie Cronje and also former Kiwi Captain Martin Crowe. Audition <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> also sent in by Ray Martin, Mike Munro, Eddie McGuire, Darrell Eastlake, Ray Warren, Molly Meldrum, Max Walker, and Jim Waley.|$|E
50|$|Like barbed wire, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} as either straight wire or spiral concertina wire. Unlike barbed wire, which usually {{is available only}} as plain steel or galvanized, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> also manufactured in stainless steel, to prevent the points from rusting to bluntness. Typically the core wire is galvanized and the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> stainless, although fully stainless barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used for expensive permanent installations or under water.|$|R
50|$|Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a medical-type <b>tape,</b> used on shin pads or socks {{over the}} shin pads {{to help keep}} them in position. The {{pressure-sensitive}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> self-adhesive and water resistant, and is elastic {{so that there is}} no risk of cutting off circulation to the legs. Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in a variety of colors, with clear tape being the most popular. Shin pad <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> discarded after use.|$|R
50|$|While no master <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the {{traditional}} sense, stereo <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> in fact created while cutting to enable future remastering.|$|R
25|$|In 1965, The Match Game {{began to}} be {{produced}} on color videotape; however, none of the <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> known to have survived the wiping and re-use procedures of NBC during that period as none of the surviving episodes are in color.|$|E
25|$|On metal toothed zippers, the {{cut edges}} of the {{rubberized}} fabric of the zipper <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually delaminate the edge. The moulded plastic zippers {{do not have an}} exposed cut edge, so do not have this weakness.|$|E
25|$|Parallel to this in 1988 {{he formed}} a band, named Alleya Alya – {{a blend of}} new wave, {{psychedelic}} art rock {{with a hint of}} ethno-elements. They made some gigs and some recording sessions, unfortunately all the <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> missing. The group disbanded two years later when Valdobrev was accepted to study acting at the Theatre and Film Academy in Sofia.|$|E
5000|$|Drip <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{thin walled}} dripperline used in drip irrigation. The first drip <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> known as [...] "Dew Hose".|$|R
5000|$|ATS/360 {{provided}} its own access {{methods and}} file formats. Offline [...] "format and print" [...] <b>tapes</b> could <b>be</b> printed using standard OS utilities as these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> compatible with BSAM, although these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> created using EXCP.|$|R
50|$|Medical <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{useful to}} both prevent and repair minor injuries. For example, <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{often used to}} fix flappers. Many climbers use tape to bind fingers or wrists to prevent {{recurring}} tendon problems. <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> also highly desirable for protecting hands on climbing routes that consist mostly of repeated hand jamming.|$|R
25|$|As {{a part of}} this process, Wolfman Jack was set {{to deliver}} the morning shows on the new station. To that end, Wolfman Jack {{recorded}} a number of programs that never aired, because the station didn't come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned from a new ship in 1983 which remained at sea until 1990.) Today those <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> traded among collectors of his work.|$|E
25|$|Video CDs do {{not come}} with closed caption (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When {{watching}} a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1¼ hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS can hold 3½ hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> available).|$|E
25|$|Others {{are looking}} for the missing {{telemetry}} tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.|$|E
5000|$|Son of Dungeon <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{cassette}} <b>tape</b> by Australian folk rock group The Triffids. [...] This <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> only {{sold at the}} Triffids’ performances in early 1988. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> not simply a re-issue of the original Dungeon Tape with only five of the original tracks making it on to this compilation tape.|$|R
50|$|Although gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used {{within the}} film/TV Industry {{as a strong}} cloth-backed {{adhesive}} tape, many other types of <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> also used, such as paper tape, pressure-sensitive tape (A.K.A. snot tape), electrical tape, J-LAR, and cloth <b>tape.</b> Gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.|$|R
50|$|Dungeon <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{cassette}} <b>tape</b> by Australian folk rock group The Triffids. This <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> only {{sold at the}} group's performances in the eastern states of Australia in 1983. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> recorded on 12 April 1981 at Dungeon Rehearsal Studios, Palmer Street, Sydney, except the last four tracks which were recorded at Mutant Mule Studios, Perth in December 1981.|$|R
25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|E

500|$|In {{his sleeve}} notes for the 1975 release of The Basement Tapes, Greil Marcus wrote, [...] "What {{was taking place}} as Dylan and The Band fiddled with the tunes, was less a style than a spirit—a spirit {{that had to do}} with a delight in {{friendship}} and invention." [...] He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: [...] "The Basement <b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain." ...|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the final}} mixes on DAT format were almost lost when the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> mangled badly. That <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} repaired allowing recovery of the mixes for this record.|$|R
30|$|Adhesive Scotch <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{placed on}} the surface of the {{honeycomb}} films in order to remove the top portion of the polymer thin film. The surface of the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> rubbed smoothly with the thumb to ensure full contact with the top layer of the honeycomb film without trapped air. Then, the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> peeled off slowly. The prepared nano-needle arrays were brought into analysis and stamping.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{a medium}} for {{magnetic}} recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> <b>tape</b> recorders and video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a <b>tape</b> drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|R
500|$|Saw is {{primarily}} a third-person survival horror game with action elements. [...] The player controls David Tapp, a former detective trapped in the Jigsaw Killer's asylum filled with traps. The primary goal {{of the game is}} to traverse the asylum and solve traps in order to escape. Tapp has several abilities in the game, such as the ability to search things like toilets and corpses to find items such as weapons, health, or clues he can use to fulfill his objectives. Items such as case files and cassette <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> found hidden around the asylum, and provide additional information about the asylum's past and give background information about certain victims.|$|E
500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man once told me that if {{you have to have an}} origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
500|$|It is {{customary}} for the Air Force {{to impound}} radar trackings involving possible litigation {{in cases of}} aviation accidents. In the civil litigation for damages, the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, {{he said he had}} [...] "misspoken" [...] and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A Pentagon spokesman concurred, saying that the <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> re-cycled for reuse from 24–30 hours afterwards; the fate of KAL007 was known inside this timeframe.|$|E
50|$|Hazard <b>Tape</b> - <b>is</b> used in {{locations}} {{containing a}} substantial danger. Examples include electrocution hazards or areas within {{which there is}} a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. Hazard <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in different color combinations, each of which indicates certain classes of threat. For example, yellow-black <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used to signal the presence of a physical hazard (e.g., a hole), while magenta-yellow denotes a radiation hazard. This type of barrier <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> commonly used in laboratories, production areas, and industrial zones.|$|R
