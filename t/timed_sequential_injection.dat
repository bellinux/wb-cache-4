The oxidation reaction of vitamin c with cerium(IV) in sulfuric acid and the complexation reaction of bromazepam with iron(II) in hydrochloric acid media, {{as well as the}} oxidation reaction of paracetamol with potassium permanganate in sulfuric acid media have been used. In each method a comprehensive chemometrical optimization treatment was fully utilized for determining the proper optimum operating conditions for both system and chemical variables. 3 f and 2 f factorial designs were used for the determination of the mainfactors such as potassium permanganate, Cerium(IV), hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid concentrations, delay time and the flow rate. The chemometrical optimization obtained by the super modified simplex revealed that the optimum operating conditions give a linear calibration plot which is reasonable for the determination of vitamin C at the range between 30 ppm to 200 ppm, paracetamol at the range between 50 to 350 ppmand bromazepam at the range between 300 ppm and 1100 ppm. These methods were applied to their different pharmaceutical forms and no excipient was found to pose any interferencethus rendering the method suitable for determination of vitamin C, paracetamol and bromazepam in different pharmaceutical preparations.

The work contained in this dissertation describes the development of novel microscale extraction methods to isolate organic compounds from biological matrices encountered in forensic toxicology. Two new extraction techniques were developed; a <b>sequential</b> <b>injection</b> liquid extraction manifold and a fiber optic fluorescence detector for monitoring a heterogeneous immunoassay. The merits of each were compared to conventional methods in forensic toxicology. Conventional liquid solvent extraction was enhanced with <b>sequential</b> <b>injection</b> extraction. The <b>sequential</b> <b>injection</b> manifold took advantage of existing liquid extraction protocols and applied them to a new method of manipulating immiscible solvents in thin tubing, that combined the merits of flow <b>injection</b> extraction and <b>sequential</b> <b>injection</b> analysis.

Nevertheless, it {{runs the risk}} of producing new problems associated with the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon, especially with multiple injections of PEGylated liposomes. Methods: Liposomes were labeled with fluorescent phospholipids of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine-N-(7 -nitro- 2 - 1, 3 -benzoxadiazol- 4 -yl) and epirubicin (EPI). The pharmacokinetics profile and biodistribution of the drug and liposome carrier following multiple injections were determined. Meanwhile, the antitumor effect of sequential low-dose chemotherapy was tested. To clarify this unexpected phenomenon, the production of polyethylene glycol (PEG) -specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), drug release, and residual complement activity experiments were conducted in serum. Results: The first or <b>sequential</b> <b>injections</b> of PEGylated liposomes within a certain dose range induced the rapid clearance of subsequently injected PEGylated liposomal EPI. Of note, the clearance of EPI was two- to three-fold faster than the liposome itself, and a large amount of EPI was released from liposomes in the first 30 minutes in a complement-activation, direct-dependent manner. The therapeutic efficacy of liposomal EPI following 10 days of <b>sequential</b> <b>injections</b> in S 180 tumor-bearing mice of 0. 75 mg EPI/kg body weight was almost completely abolished between the sixth and tenth day of the <b>sequential</b> <b>injections,</b> even although the subsequently injected doses were doubled. The level of PEG-specific IgM in the blood increased rapidly, with a larger amount of complement being activated while the concentration of EPI in blood and tumor tissue was significantly reduced. Conclusion: Our investigation implied that the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon and its accompanying rapid leakage and clearance of drug following <b>sequential</b> low-dose <b>injections</b> may reverse the unique pharmacokinetic–toxicity profile of liposomes which deserved our attention. Therefore, a more reasonable treatment regime should be selected to lessen or even eliminate this phenomenon.
