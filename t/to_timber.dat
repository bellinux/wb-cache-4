5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus <b>to</b> <b>timber.</b> On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E
5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E
5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Scotland in the prehistoric era includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, {{before the arrival}} of the Romans in Britain in the first century BCE. Stone Age settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at Knap of Howar, Orkney and settlements like Skara Brae. There are also large numbers of chambered tombs and cairns from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen barrows, often linked <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include bank barrows, cursus monuments, mortuary enclosures and timber halls. From the Bronze Age there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of crannogs, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of Clava cairns and the first hillforts. From the Iron Age there is evidence of substantial stone Atlantic roundhouses, which include broch towers, smaller duns. There is also evidence of about 1,000 hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak's {{rain forests}} are {{primarily}} {{threatened by the}} logging industry and palm oil plantations. The issue of human rights of the Penan and deforestation in Sarawak became an international environmental issue when Swiss activist Bruno Manser visited Sarawak regularly between 1984 and 2000. Deforestation has affected the life of indigenous tribes, especially the Penan, whose livelihood is heavily dependent on forest produce. This led to several blockades by indigenous tribes during the 1980s and 1990s against logging companies encroaching on their lands. There have also been cases where Native Customary Rights (NCR) lands have been given <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> and plantation companies without {{the permission of the}} locals. The indigenous people have resorted to legal means to reinstate their NCR. In 2001 the High Court of Sarawak fully reinstated the NCR land claimed by the Rumah Nor people, but this was overturned partially in 2005. However, this case has served as a precedent, leading to more NCR being upheld by the high court in the following years. Sarawak's mega-dam policies, such as the Bakun Dam and Murum Dam projects, have submerged thousands of hectares of forest and displaced thousands of indigenous people. Since 2013, the proposed Baram Dam project has been delayed due to ongoing protests from local indigenous tribes. Since 2014, the Sarawak government under chief minister Adenan Satem started to take action against illegal logging in the state and to diversify the economy of the state. Through the course of 2016 over 2 million acres of forest, much of it in orangutan habitats, were declared protected areas.|$|E

25|$|The stone {{buildings}} {{imposed on}} England by the Romans {{would have been}} 'startling' and 'exceptional', and following the collapse of Roman society in the fifth century there was a widespread return <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> building, a 'cultural shift' {{that it is not}} possible to explain by recourse to technological determinism.|$|E
25|$|Firewood usually relates <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> or trees {{unsuitable}} for building or construction.

25|$|Ethiopia loses an {{estimated}} 1,410km2 of natural forests each year. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000km2 of forests. Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives <b>to</b> <b>timber.</b> In rural areas {{the government also}} provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 Jim {{was coming}} {{regularly}} <b>to</b> <b>Timbers</b> games with his family.

25|$|However, Tharp's {{attempts}} to conserve the giant sequoias were at first met with only limited success. In the 1880s, white settlers seeking {{to create a}} utopian society founded the Kaweah Colony, which sought economic success in trading Sequoia timber. However, Sequoia trees, unlike their coast redwood relatives, were later discovered to splinter easily and therefore were ill-suited <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> harvesting, though thousands of trees were felled before logging operations finally ceased.|$|E
25|$|Woodworking was {{essential}} to the Romans. It provided, sometimes the only, material for buildings, transportation, tools, and household items. Wood also provided pipes, dye, waterproofing materials, and energy for heat.Although most examples of Roman woodworking have been lost, the literary record preserved much of the contemporary knowledge. Vitruvius dedicates an entire chapter of his De architectura <b>to</b> <b>timber,</b> preserving many details. Pliny, while not a botanist, dedicated six books of his Natural History to trees and woody plants, providing {{a wealth of information}} on trees and their uses.|$|E
25|$|Grasses {{are used}} as raw {{material}} for a multitude of purposes, including construction and {{in the composition of}} building materials such as cob, for insulation, in the manufacture of paper and board such as Oriented structural straw board. Grass fiber can be used for making paper, and for biofuel production.Bamboo scaffolding is able to withstand typhoon-force winds that would break steel scaffolding. Larger bamboos and Arundo donax have stout culms {{that can be used in}} a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>timber,</b> Arundo is used to make reeds for woodwind instruments, and bamboo is used for innumerable implements.|$|E
50|$|Around 1862, {{the area}} around Maroochydore was opened up for development. In 1863, William Pettigrew visited the area and found there was {{plentiful}} <b>timber</b> <b>to</b> be obtained, including hardwood, cedar, bunya and kauri pine. Although there was good timber there, the Maroochy River bar was hazardous. So William Pettigrew established a depot and wharf at Mooloolah Heads (now known as Mooloolaba) <b>to</b> deliver <b>timber</b> <b>to</b> his Brisbane sawmill.|$|R

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, work on the Great Hall ceased. Some of the students enlisted {{in the armed forces}} while others assisted on the home front. Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jörgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd bits and pieces – from discarded broken bricks and rusty galvanized iron <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> poles cut from the bush. Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets.|$|E
25|$|The charcoal—which {{gave the}} forest its name and {{into which the}} once seeming inexhaustible woods were slowly converted—was {{required}} to fuel the scattered smelting furnaces that forged the plentiful iron found in outcroppings laid bare by riverside erosion. Even before the Romans arrived, iron weapons forged in the Silva Carbonaria were traded by the Belgae to their cousins in the southeast of Britain. In the High Middle Ages further woodlands were cleared. Today the most significant remnant of the Silva Carbonaria is the Sonian Forest, preserved {{because it had been}} set aside as a noble hunt. At the start of the nineteenth century the area of this remnant of the primeval forest still covered about 100 square kilometres, but due <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> cutting its area has diminished to its current protected area of 44.21 km².|$|E
25|$|Knightsbridge when {{a village}} {{was laid out}} under that name in 1848. The village was laid out in section 298 in the land between First and Second Creeks. Unlike other more brilliantly {{designed}} early villages (such as Beaumont) Knightsbridge was laid out by a Captain Hall, originally from Port Adelaide. He simply divided the land into eight blocks and ran Knightsbridge Road through them. Much of the land was sold <b>to</b> <b>timber</b> merchants, who quickly made use of the suburb's thick bushland. The first house in the suburb, which remains to this day on 12 Hazelwood Avenue, was built by George Taylor, a local grocer, in 1854. Named Knightsbridge House, it was unique in having much of the ground floor situated half-underground {{to cope with the}} fierce Australian summers. The total property owned by Taylor amounted to thirty-three acres, which included much of today's suburb. He returned to England in 1856 and leased the property out.|$|E
