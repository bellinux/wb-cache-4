5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E

40|$|Lavendamycin, an aminoquinolinedione {{antibiotic}} {{is similar}} to streptonigrin, an antibiotic with known antiretroviral activity. Their applicability as drugs is limited due to their high toxicity to mammalian cells. A series of novel analogs of lavendamycin has been recently synthesized. In initial screening, three of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> showed significant inhibitory activity toward the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and exhibited little or no animal toxicity and relatively low cellular cytotoxicity. In this study, we determined the anti-retroviral activity of nine analogs by assessing their anti-reverse transcriptase(anti-RT) activity in comparison to streptonigrin. Using both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AMV reverse transcriptase in vitro we found that <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> exhibited significant anti-RT activity. The inhibitory activity of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> was dose dependent, and they had different effects on the two enzymes. At 30 µM seven of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> inhibited HIV-RT activity by 50 % or more. At this concentration, two of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> were significantly more effective than streptonigrin. AMV-RT was more sensitive toward both streptonigrin and several of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> than was HIV-RT. Furthermore, combination of azidothymidine (AZT) -triphosphate (TP) and several of analogs showed synergistic inhibitory effects at low doses. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} pilot {{conversion}} course, {{it became apparent}} that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics different from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the digital cockpit fitted instead of <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted {{to the development of a}} two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick and using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball.

5|$|Ape Escape is a {{platform}} game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. For {{most of the}} game, players control Spike—a boy tasked with pursuing and capturing the apes across time, preventing them from rewriting history. Players use various gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, such as the Stun Club, used as an offensive measure against enemies, and the Time Net, used to capture apes and transport them to present day. More gadgets become available as players progress through the game. Players also control vehicles throughout the game, including a rubber raft, which allows travel over water, and the water net, which assists in traversing underwater. The game's controls are heavily centered around <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> sticks: the left stick is used to move players, while the right stick manipulates the various gadgets.|$|E
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E

5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} {{multicast}} (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T broadcasting {{of the main}} channels) was to cease in 2010. The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. <b>The</b> <b>analog</b> broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

50|$|Animal {{studies on}} monkeys and rats {{have tried to}} assess the {{self-administration}} propensity of phenyltropane analogs alongside cocaine. Frequently <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> are administered {{prior to the start}} of a session to see if they can suppress cocaine lever responding. Most of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> behave in ways that might be considered typical for a DRI. In particular, they tend to stimulate locomotor activity, and cause nonselective reductions in cocaine intake relative to food. At the dose that can reduce cocaine intake, most of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> require a high DAT occupancy. This would mean that the agonists would need to be behaviorally active at the dose that can bring about reductions in cocaine craving. Most of <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> will readily substitute for cocaine, although most do not elicit as many lever responses per session because of pharmacokinetic factors. Since these agonists function as reinforcers, there is an obvious concern surrounding their abuse liability.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>analog</b> {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} Silent Hill 2 is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James {{moving in the}} direction that he is facing when the player tilts <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick upwards. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

Vig and audio engineer Billy Bush were able to track down an archived, but rather incomplete and damaged, set of 16bit 44.1kHz safety DAT mixes. Despite the backups being far from an optimal situation, mastering engineer Emily Lazar at The Lodge in New York City was able to reverse engineer the missing songs from the damaged archive. Lazar used some alternate versions of the songs when completing the final master. Her assistant, Joe LaPorta, mastered and edited the remixes for the special edition.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with <b>the</b> <b>analog</b> stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E

40|$|Plant cells {{resistant}} to specific amino acid analogs {{have been reported}} to accumulate the corresponding free amino acids. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the concentrations of fifteen free amino acids: alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamate, proline, arginine, aspartate, threonine, methionine, lysine, serine, glycine, tryptophan and phenylalanine in Daucus carota cell lines, resistant either to <b>the</b> proline <b>analog</b> azetidine- 2 carboxylic acid (A 2 C), or to <b>the</b> tryptophan <b>analog</b> 5 -methyltryptophan (5 -MT), or to both <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> combined. This study also intended to determine if these <b>analogs</b> influence <b>the</b> biosynthesis of the above-mentioned fifteen amino acids in the cell line {{resistant to}} A 2 C and 5 -MT. Carrot cell lines resistant to 5 -MT, to A 2 C, or to both <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> were selected by incubating carrot cells in liquid growth media containing either 0. 3 mM 5 -MT, or 0. 5 mM A 2 C for 6 to 16 weeks. Free amino acid concentrations were then determined in the extracts of the cells. Resistance to 5 -MT resulted in significant increases in the intracellular concentrations of tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, and proline. Resistance to A 2 C resulted in significant increase in proline only. Resistance to both <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> caused increases in proline, lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan concentrations. In the cell line resistant to both <b>the</b> <b>analogs,</b> <b>the</b> treatment with 5 -MT caused increases in leucine, proline, aspartate, threonine, lysine, and tryptophan. The treatment with A 2 C caused increases in isoleucine, arginine, threonine, methionine, lysine, and glycine, whereas treatment with both <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> caused increases in threonine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. These results indicate the possibility of a common biosynthetic control of a number of amino acids in carrot cells, resembling that found in microorganisms. It is also evident from the results that <b>the</b> <b>analogs</b> play an active role in the biosynthesis of amino acids in the resistant cell lines...|$|R
