5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> primarily at his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It.</b> Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques {{in an attempt}} to recreate the Motown music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album draws on the Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{promoted}} Stone Rollin with a North American spring tour, {{performing a}} series of concerts during March to June 2011. It began on March 15 at the House of Blues in Dallas and concluded on June 8 at Stubb's in Austin, Texas. Some concert dates featured electronic music duo Quadron as an opening act. The tour included performances at music festivals such as South by Southwest and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, for which Saadiq played songs from <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> and Stone Rollin, as well as unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It.</b> However, for Stone Rollin, they sought to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> with exploring rhythm and blues, rock, funk, and blues styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E

5|$|In {{reproducing}} the album's {{recorded music}} onstage, he performed with his eight-piece band, which included bass player Calvin Turner, drummers Lemar Carter and Charles Jones, guitarists Rob Bacon and Josh Smith, and backing singers Erika Jerry and BJ Kemp. In {{contrast to his}} touring for <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> Saadiq {{did not include a}} horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E
25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a man like that. After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to play around with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was {{included}} {{in a number of}} critics' best albums lists. It was named one of the year's 10-best records by the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the Houston Chronicle, which cited it as ninth best. It was also ranked at number five by Exclaim!, number seven by The Irish Times, number one by NPR, number five by The Observer, number three by Time Out, and number two by USA Today. <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was voted the 18th best album of 2008 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in The Village Voice; the poll's singles list had six of the album's songs voted in, including [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] at number 114 and both [...] "Love That Girl" [...] and [...] "Big Easy" [...] at number 250. Nate Chinen of The New York Times included [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] in his top-five singles list for 2008. <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> also nominated for the 2009 Grammy Award for Best R Album. [...] "Love That Girl" [...] was nominated for Best Traditional R Vocal Performance, while [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] was nominated for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq called <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> [...] "the {{culmination}} of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." [...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{said that he was}} [...] "blown away" [...] by <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> citing it as [...] "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." [...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> showed them that yes, I could put the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> {{also earned}} Saadiq the highest {{international}} profile of his career. In promoting the album, he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist. His extensive touring in the US and Europe garnered {{the attention of}} younger, white audiences who were not exposed to his previous solo albums and work with Tony! Toni! Toné!. The Press of Atlantic City wrote that the album [...] "brought {{in a whole new}} generation of Saadiq fans, with songs such as '100 Yard Dash' striking a chord with even ironic teenagers." [...] According to Gail Mitchell of Billboard, <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> helped Saadiq reach [...] "the major-market hipster crowd, music supervisors and festival bookers." [...] He also attained a following among Japanese audiences. Saadiq's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album, Stone Rollin', in 2011, as he noted the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live. It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> {{was largely}} {{overlooked}} by consumers upon its release. The album debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 23,000 copies {{in the week}} of October 4. Nonetheless, it was Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States at the time, and by November, had steadily sold 76,919 copies. Five singles were released from the album—"Love That Girl" [...] on August 5, 2008, [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] on March 30, 2009, [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] on May 27, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] on August 7, and [...] "Staying in Love" [...] on October 5. [...] "Love That Girl", [...] "Never Give You Up", and [...] "Staying in Love" [...] all charted on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at number 45, number 26, and number 74, respectively. During 2009, Saadiq travelled for promotional television appearances and press in Europe, where <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> had charted in several countries. In France, the record spent 51 weeks on the country's albums chart, peaking at number 13 in the week of February 24. In August, it re-entered the American chart at number 101 and had sold 215,000 copies. The album charted for 41 weeks on the Billboard 200, serving as the longest chart-run of Saadiq's career. By May 2011, it had sold 282,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier Assayas said {{he admired}} Nolan for [...] "making {{movies that are}} really unlike {{anything}} else. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> he has a really authentic voice." [...] Discussing the difference between art films and big-studio films, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series {{as an example of}} both; he has described Memento and Inception as [...] "masterworks". Nolan has also been commended by James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, Matt Reeves, Danny Boyle, Wong Kar-Wai, Steven Soderbergh, Sam Mendes, Werner Herzog, Matthew Vaughn, Paul Thomas Anderson, Paul Greengrass, Rian Johnson, and others. Noted film critic Mark Kermode complimented the director for bringing [...] "the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking" [...] to Hollywood blockbusters, calling him [...] " [...] living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable".|$|E
5000|$|Bentley {{stated that}} he found [...] "a real honesty in the lyrics" [...] and that [...] "the {{differences}} in how guys and girls deal with a broken heart is really interesting material to me.

500|$|In 2008, Saadiq {{released}} his third album <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> which featured 1960s Motown Sound-inspired songs with traditional soul music influences. The album {{was also an}} exemplary release of the [...] "classic soul revival" [...] during its peak at the time, a music scene marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists making comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. In promoting the album, Saadiq broadened his audience demographic and expanded as a touring artist, playing various music festivals throughout Europe and the United States. Along with the musical aesthetic of the album, Saadiq himself adopted a vintage soul image, donning old-fashioned attire and performing traditional R dance moves at shows. His touring also inspired his approach for Stone Rollin, as he considered the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> has a {{traditional}} soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul. It is {{a departure from}} Saadiq's previous work with neo soul, which bears a hip hop influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond {{his work as a}} producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a [...] "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". BBC Music's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of [...] "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-Obama expression of hope in record form." [...] Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction {{as a response to the}} state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: [...] "You force so many terrible things on people, they get tired of it. We have a black president now." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E
