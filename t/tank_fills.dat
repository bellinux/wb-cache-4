5000|$|The Kaveri Sankramana festival {{normally}} {{takes place}} in mid-October. It {{is associated with the}} river Kaveri, which flows through the district from its source at Talakaveri.At a predetermined time, when the sun enters Tula Rasi (Tula sankramana), a fountain from a small <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> the larger holy tank at Talakaveri. Thousands of people gather to dip in this holy water. The water is collected in bottles and reaches every home throughout Kodagu. This holy water is called Theertha, and is preserved in all Kodava homes. A spoonful of this water is fed to the dying, in the belief that they will attain moksha (spiritual emancipation) and gain entry to heaven. On this day, married women wearing new silk saris perform puja to a vegetable, symbolising the goddess Kaveri. The vegetable is usually a cucumber or a coconut, wrapped in a piece of red silk cloth and decorated with flowers and jewels (mainly 'Pathak' (Kodava Mangalasuthra)). This is called the Kanni Puje. The word Kanni denotes the goddess Parvati, who incarnated as Kaveri. Three sets of betel leaves and areca nut are kept in front of the goddess with bunches of glass bangles. All the members of the family pray to the goddess by throwing rice and prostrating themselves before the image. The elder members of the family ceremonially bless the younger. An older married woman then draws water from the well and starts cooking. The menu of the day is dosa and vegetable curry (usually pumpkin curry (kumbala kari) [...] ) and payasa. Nothing but vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and this is the only festival which is strictly vegetarian. Alcohol is prohibited. The Kaveri cult has its center and origin in Kodagu. It is only those Kodava rites associated with the river Kaveri that are Brahmanical in influence.|$|E
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{vent system}} for a cryogenic nitrogen tank was tested in a vacuum chamber simulating oxygen storage in low earth orbit. The nitrogen tank {{was surrounded by a}} cryo-shroud at - 40 F. The tank was insulated with two layers of multi-layer insulation. Heat transfer into cryogenic tanks causes phase change and increases tank pressure which must be controlled. A thermodynamic vent system was used to control pressure as the location of vapor is unknown in low gravity and direct venting would be wasteful. The thermodynamic vent system consists of a Joule-Thomson valve and heat exchanger installed on the inlet side of the tank mixer-pump. The combination is used to extract thermal energy from the tank fluid, reducing temperature and ullage pressure. The system was sized so that the tank mixer-pump operated {{a small fraction of the}} time to limit motor heating. Initially the mixer used sub-cooled liquid to cool the liquid-vapor interface inducing condensation and pressure reduction. Later, the thermodynamic vent system was used. Pressure cycles were performed until steady-state operation was demonstrated. Three test runs were conducted at <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> of 97, 80, and 63 percent. Each test was begun with a boil-off test to determine heat transfer into the tank. The lower <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> had time averaged vent rates very close to steady-state boil-off rates showing the thermodynamic vent system was nearly as efficient as direct venting in normal gravity...|$|E
40|$|A planned {{function}} of the Space Station is to refurbish and refuel an advanced space-based LO 2 /LH 2 orbit transfer vehicle. An alternative to propellant storage at the station {{is to use a}} remote facility tied to the station with a log tether. Preliminary design of such a facility is described with emphasis on fluid transfer and storage requirements. Using tether lengths of at least 300 ft, gravity gradient forces will dominate surface tension in such a system. Although gravity given transfer is difficult because of line pressure drops, fluid settling over the tank outlet greatly alleviates acquisition concerns and will facilitate vented <b>tank</b> <b>fills.</b> The major concern with a tethered orbital refueling facility is its considerable operational complexity including transport of the OTV to and from the facility...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{a study of}} inner-tank sloshing effect on motion responses of a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) system, through experimental analysis and numerical modeling. To investigate hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG under the conditions of with and without LNG-tank sloshing, a series of numerical simulations were carried out using potential flow solver SESAM. To validate the numerical simulations, model tests on the FLNG system was conducted in both liquid and solid ballast conditions with 75 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level in height. Good correlations were observed between the measured and predicted results, proving the feasibility of the numerical modeling technique. On the verified numerical model, Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) of the FLNG with 25 % and 50 % <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels were calculated in six degrees of freedom. The influence of tank sloshing with varying <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> levels on the RAOs has been presented and analyzed. The results showed that LNG-tank sloshing has a noticeable impact on the roll motion response of the FLNG and a moderate <b>tank</b> <b>filling</b> level is less helpful in reducing the roll motion response...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{convective}} {{building of a}} pycnocline using a laboratory model forced by surface fluxes of saline water {{at one end and}} fresh water at the other. A deep recirculation evolves in the tank, which homogenizes the interior fluid by repeated passes through the dense, descending plume. A thin, fresh surface layer develops and modifies the effective buoyancy flux into the the dense plume, causing the interior velocities to fall to an intermediate-time minimum. Adding bottom topography under the dense source greatly reduces the amount of entrainment which the descending plume undergoes. In this case, the <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> with a deep, heavy layer, which causes the plume to “lift off ” the bottom of the tank and detrain at successively higher depths in the water column. A simple numerical “plume ” model shows that this cannot be a steady state, as it is not in diffusive balance; the plume must eventually return {{to the bottom of the}} tank and ventilate the interior waters. Adding rotation increases the surface mixing, thickens the halocline, and increases the observed variability in the salinity field. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} a water level control system extended from the one of Alur et al. [1] and our previous paper [4]. In particular, we use this case study to demonstrate the influence which different abstractions of the same continuous stochastic command have. The abstraction of a guarded command with a continuous probability distribution into one with a discrete probability distribution is described in a recent publication [2]. A water tank is filled by a constant stream of water and is connected to a pump which is used to avoid overflow of the tank. A control system operates the pump {{in order to keep the}} water level within predefined bounds. The controller is connected to a sensor measuring the level of water in the tank. A sketch of the model is given in Figure 1. The state “Tank ” models the tank and the pump, and w is the water level. Initially, the Figure 1 : Sketch of the Water Level Control Model tank contains a given amount of water. Whenever the pump is turned off in state “Off”, the <b>tank</b> <b>fills</b> with a constant rate due to the inflow. Conversely, more water is pumped out than flows in when the pump is on...|$|E
40|$|Once a {{septic tank}} and {{absorption}} field are installed, {{you can do}} several things to prolong their life, thus protecting an investment which may cost 2500 or more. Here are several tips you can follow. Often overlooked or neglected {{is the fact that}} septic tanks should be inspected at least once annually. In every properly functioning septic tank, sludge accumulates in the bottom. This sludge is composed of solid materials and must be removed periodically. If the sludge is not removed, the accumulated solids will build up in the septic tank and will begin to wash out into the absorption field. Allowing solids from the septic tank to wash out into the absorption field will eventually clog it to the point where a new field will be needed. Most authorities agree that for a typical three-bedroom home, a 1, 000 -gallon (3, 800 I) septic tank will need to have the solids removed every three to five years. Smaller tanks must be pumped more often. Septic tank additives that 2 ̆ 2 clean 2 ̆ 2 the tank are available, but these are generally not recommended. Some additives may cause the solids to be flushed from the septic tank into the absorption field, causing clogging problems. Other compounds may produce a septic tank effluent which will destroy soil structure and cause premature failure of the soil absorption system. To determine if your septic tank needs pumping, the thickness of the sludge can be measured as illustrated in Figure 1. To measure the depth of the sludge, wrap a long stick with a piece of rough, white toweling and tie it securely. Lower the stick through the inlet tee (to avoid the scum) {{to the bottom of the}} tank. Wait about 30 seconds and remove the stick slowly and carefully. Black particles will cling to the towel indicating the depth of the sludge. The sludge should be removed if its depth is equal to one third or more of the liquid depth. Occasionally, a floating scum layer may develop in septic tanks. This scum layer can also cause clogging and should be checked annually. The scum layer thickness can be measured with a stick and hinged flap device (Figure 1). Push the stick through the scum until the hinged flap falls into the horizontal position. Raise the stick until you feel the bottom of the layer. Mark the stick to indicate the depth of the scum layer. Now use the same procedure to locate the lower end of the submerged inlet pipe. If the bottom side of the scum layer is within three inches (7. 6 em) of the lower end of the submerged inlet, the septic tank should be pumped. Most communities have contractors who pump septic tanks. It may cost 50 or more, but it is necessary for maintaining the life of the absorption field. The contractors pump the contents into a tank truck and dispose of it at an approved treatment site or by proper land application. Be sure the workman who cleans your tank mixes the liquid, sludge and scum before pumping so that all of the material can be removed, not just the liquid. It is not recommended to wash, scrub or disinfect the septic tank when pumping. Similarly, it is not necessary to leave solids in the septic to 2 ̆ 2 start 2 ̆ 2 it again. Normally, as the septic <b>tank</b> <b>fills,</b> the natural processes begin. Products to 2 ̆ 2 seed 2 ̆ 2 the system with desirable bacteria are available, but they are also not necessary...|$|E
