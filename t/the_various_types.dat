The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly {{explained in terms of}} their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E

5|$|The London Naval Treaty of 1930 {{mandated}} that Wyoming be demilitarized; she accordingly was {{converted into a}} training ship, with half of her main battery turrets, belt armor, and anti-torpedo bulges removed. Arkansas was permitted to continue in service with the fleet, however. After the United States entered World War II, Arkansas was used to escort convoys to North Africa. By 1944, she served as a coastal bombardment vessel; in this role, she supported Allied landings at Normandy (Operation Overlord) and southern France (Operation Dragoon) before being transferred to the Pacific, where she provided fire support to Marines fighting on Iwo Jima and at Okinawa in 1945. Wyoming meanwhile continued as a training ship, being modified further in 1944 to include <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of anti-aircraft guns that trainees would operate in the fleet. Both ships were decommissioned shortly after the war, with Arkansas being expended as a target ship during the 1946 nuclear tests at Operation Crossroads, and Wyoming being sold for scrap in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Being {{the first}} part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of coral reef, each chapter {{starting with a}} section giving {{a detailed description of}} the reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E

5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>types</b> of football.|$|E
