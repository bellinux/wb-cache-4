40|$|Since the New Zealand Government {{signed the}} Kyoto Protocol some {{policies}} and {{projects have been}} made and carried out for cutting down carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 -e) emissions in this country. Reducing CO 2 -e emissions from domestic transport becomes one critical object {{as it has been}} a main part of total CO 2 -e emissions. The domestic transport sector itself accounted for 42. 3 per cent of <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> greenhouse gas emissions in 2006. Total CO 2 -e emissions from domestic transport have increased by 64. 1 per cent from 1990 to 2006. This paper first introduces some troublesome issues happening in Auckland caused by transport emissions. Meanwhile, the authors try to reveal how difficult it is for Aucklanders to achieve the promised level of emissions in accordance with the signature of the Kyoto Protocol. In 2006, New Zealand further released its aim of becoming a ―Carbon Neutral‖ country in the world. Following its determination of becoming ―Carbon Neutral‖ in 2020 this nation must make more concerns about its CO 2 -e emissions. This paper also articulates what is the sub-aim in the domestic transport sector of Auckland for achieving ―Carbon Neutrality‖...|$|E
40|$|China {{has become}} the third largest energy user in the world, and its coal-dominated energy {{structure}} implies high CO 2 emissions. The amount of CO 2 emissions from China may surpass that of the United States within 20 - 30 years, making China the world's largest source of greenhouse gases by 2020. Currently, renewable energy resources (except for hydropower) account for {{only a fraction of}} China's total energy consumption. However, China has abundant solar energy resources. More than two thirds of China receives an annual total insolation that exceeds 5. 9 GJ/m 2 (1, 639 kWh/m 2) with more than 2, 200 hours of sunshine a year. Wind energy potential in China is about 3, 200 GW, of which 253 GW is deemed technically exploitable. China has a wide range of biomass resources {{that can be used for}} energy supply and high temperature geothermal resources suitable for power generation located mainly in Tibet and Yunnan provinces. Renewable energy technologies have been actively deployed in China. Although PV power stations have not being connected to the national grid, total installed capacity was 3 MW in 1994. Solar water heaters are by far the largest solar thermal application in China with a total installed capacity of 3. 3 million m 2 in 1994. By the end of 1995, total installed capacity of grid-connected wind power plants had reached 36 MW. Also, over 140, 000 small wind generators ranging in size from 50 W to 5 kW have been deployed with a total installed capacity of 17 MW. China is a world leader in the development and application of anaerobic technologies for the production of fuel gas and waste treatment and has by far the largest biomass gasification R&D capacity in the. Although renewable energy is projected to play a small role in future electricity generation, it is expected to be much more significant in the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sector.</b> Under one scenario, renewable energy other than hydro provides up to 4 % of the total energy supply and 88 million tons of carbon emission reduction by 2020. The estimated growth in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as serious local and regional environmental pollution problems caused by combustion of fossil fuels, provide strong arguments for the development of renewable energy resources. ...|$|E

We use multiple existing spatial databases to identify urban extent, greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2, N 2 O, CH 4 and SF 6) and covariates of emissions in a "top-down" analysis. The results indicate that urban activities are significant sources of total greenhouse gas missions (36. 8 and 48. 6 % of <b>total).</b> The urban <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> accounts for between 41. 5 and 66. 3 % of <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> emissions. Significant differences exist in the urban share of greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries as well as among source sectors for geographic regions.

We find that greenhouse gas emissions are significantly associated with population size, density, growth rates, and per capita income.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{developed}} countries, the construction sector {{now accounts for}} 20 to 40 % of the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. This <b>sector</b> is {{a key factor in}} national economies, and it not only represents a critical consumption of resources, but also creates the built environment. These are some of the reasons why researchers around the world have recently developed procedures to determine the environmental impacts of whole buildings. In this context, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a useful tool to analyze buildings from the environmental point of view. This article shows the results obtained by applying the LCA methodology to three residential buildings. Each studied dwelling is located in different urban context and is different from a typological and constructive point of view. This article discusses the importance of the choice for a building location and selection of source materials relating to the total environmental impact.

40|$|Bio-energy is {{expected}} to become increasingly attractive in the future owing to its potential to contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing rural and regional employment and improving energy security through substituting for oil imports. The volume of sustainable biomass resources that are economically competitive but do not significantly impact on food production {{is expected}} to slowly expand as new feedstock varieties and refining pathways are developed. However, these volumes will remain limited relative to <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> and transport <b>sector</b> fuel demand. Limited biomass resources will be allocated to the sector that is most able to afford them. This {{will depend on the}} price of existing fossil fuel products and the relative cost of converting biomass into substitute final fuels such as bio-derived electricity, ethanol blends, biodiesel and bio-derived jet fuel. It will also depend on factors such as the availability and cost of alternative fuel and energy sources, government policies including excise rates, and the emission intensity of each sector. This paper presents a number of alternative cost curves for bio-energy resource to final energy costs and applies a partial equilibrium model of the electricity and transport <b>sectors,</b> called the <b>Energy</b> <b>Sector</b> Model (ESM), to determine where the limited biomass resources are likely to be allocated under various scenarios.

Our case study of Shenyang in this paper shows how a clear inventory analysis on GHG emissions at city level can help to identify the major industries and societal sectors for reduction efforts so as to facilitate low-carbon policy-making. The results showed total carbon emission in 2007 was 57 Mt CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e), of which 41 Mt CO 2 e was in-boundary emissions and 16 Mt CO 2 e was out-of-boundary emissions. The <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> was dominant in the emission inventory, accounting for 93. 1 % of <b>total</b> emissions. Within <b>energy</b> <b>sector,</b> emissions from <b>energy</b> production industry, manufacturing and construction industry accounted for 88. 4 % of this sector. Our analysis showed that comparing with geographical boundary, setting system boundary based on single process standard could provide better information to decision makers for carbon emission reduction. After attributing electricity and heating consumption to final users, the resident and commercial sector became the largest emitter, accounting for 28. 5 % of total emissions.

The policies affecting renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> development, including woody biomass availability and GHG reduction targets, also differ significantly. Adoption of new technologies with niche applications, leveraged with knowledge from the best practices and experience of countries with well-established bioenergy supply chains, represent an opportunity to set strong foundations for bioenergy production in countries with immature bioenergy sectors. Based on this analysis, it appears prima facie that the goal of reducing GHG emissions is only one of many factors that determine how much emphasis individual nations place on developing non-hydro renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sectors</b> (including woody biomass). The development of a woody biomass <b>energy</b> <b>sector</b> may be driven most strongly by regional issues, such as the need for less expensive waste disposal, cost-effective substitutions for fossil fuels, local economic development and energy resilience. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.
