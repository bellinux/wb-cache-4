5|$|Johnston {{was not in}} Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper {{changed his}} mind {{on the morning of}} the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew.|$|E
5|$|During the Ashes tour, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring {{who was a}} {{teammate}} in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg-spin bowler, he and Johnston were in direct competition for {{a place in the}} eleven. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. When Johnston was omitted in favour of Ring, it appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Bradman changed his mind {{on the morning of the}} First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. He showed his credentials by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> a victory. England batted first and with strike bowler Ray Lindwall breaking down on the first day, Johnston removed Bill Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior in one over to leave England at 4/46. He returned later in the innings to take 5/36 from 25 overs as England were bowled out for 165. After scoring an unbeaten 17 in a last-wicket partnership of 33, Johnston bowled 59 overs in the second innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 1–0 lead.|$|E

These were the first wooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe’s, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker’s squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out.</b> Munroe showed up at Andrew’s hardware store with over four hundred pencils {{less than two weeks}} later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils that he could make in a certain time frame.|$|E

But I could have no real qualms overall. I thought Tipp were a slightly better team than us.” ...|$|R

25|$|On {{returning}} to London {{with his son}} in August 1827, Hazlitt was shocked to discover that his wife, still in Paris, was leaving him. He settled in modest lodgings on Half-Moon Street, and thereafter waged an unending battle against poverty, as he found himself forced <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> a stream of mostly undistinguished articles for weeklies like The Atlas to generate desperately needed cash. Relatively little is known of Hazlitt's other activities in this period. He spent as much time, apparently, at Winterslow {{as he did in}} London. Some meditative essays emerged from this stay in his favourite country retreat, and he also made progress with his life of Napoleon. But he also found himself struggling against bouts of illness, nearly dying at Winterslow in December 1827. Two volumes—the first half—of the Napoleon biography appeared in 1828, only to have its publisher fail soon thereafter. This entailed even more financial difficulties for the author, and what little evidence we have of his activities at the time consists in large part of begging letters to publishers for advances of money.|$|E
500|$|The {{workload}} of the captaincy {{was telling}} on Chappell and the four-Test Ashes series {{that followed the}} World Cup dampened his appetite for the game. After winning the only completed match of the series, the first Test at Birmingham, Australia's [...] retention of the Ashes was anti-climactic: the third Test at Leeds was abandoned due to vandalism of the pitch during {{the night before the}} last day's play. In the last Test at the Oval, Chappell scored 192 from 367 balls to set up an apparent victory. However, England managed to bat for almost 15 hours <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> a draw and Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy {{on the final day of}} the match. In 30 Tests as captain, he scored 2,550 runs at an average of 50, with seven centuries.|$|E

JRU and San Beda remained tied for #2 with contrasting wins against AUF and CSB; JRU had <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> it <b>out</b> with AUF which is in a 14-game losing streak, while San Beda had an easier time as a depleted CSB {{ran out of gas}} in the fourth quarter.

5000|$|Moran forged his knives using a coal forge in {{the manner}} of a {{blacksmith}} using a hammer and anvil to shape the steel. In the 1950s he was one of the last few bladesmiths in the United States, forging his metal as opposed <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> blades <b>out</b> of stock. Moran began trying to revive the ancient process of forging Damascus steel in the late 1960s. However, no living bladesmith knew the exact techniques and without a recipe for the process, it was in danger of being lost; through trial and error he taught himself pattern welding and referred to it as [...] "Damascus steel".|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} High School in 2003, Curtiss began {{creating}} and circulating numerous mixtapes to his Cerritos college classmates. After joining Myspace in 2005, {{he began to}} gain local popularity for his self pressed projects.

K-Dot (Kendrick Lamar). Later that same year Curtiss King signed to Rocstarr Entertainment, an up-and-coming independent label run by producer Tae Beast and producer/engineer/songwriter Starr Lab based out of Inglewood. Under the imprint he released two well received street albums Notorious Scholars and The Storm On Mars which boasted features from Ab-Soul and Young Rook as well as production from Tae Beast.

2500|$|... 4–5–1 is a {{defensive}} formation; however, {{if the two}} midfield wingers play a more attacking role, it can be likened to 4–3–3. The formation can be used <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> 0–0 draws or preserve a lead, as the packing of the centre midfield {{makes it difficult for}} the opposition to build up play. Because of the [...] "closeness" [...] of the midfield, the opposing team's forwards will often be starved of possession. Due to the lone striker, however, the centre of the midfield does have the responsibility of pushing forward as well. The defensive midfielder will often control the pace of the game.|$|E
2500|$|The {{third quarter}} ended just over six minutes later, shortly after a missed 45-yard field goal attempt by Falcons kicker Norm Johnson, {{which turned out}} to be Atlanta's last chance to get back in the game. Less than two minutes into the fourth quarter, Falcons {{receiver}} Michael Haynes lost a fumble while being tackled by Gouveia, which linebacker Wilber Marshall recovered on the Redskins 48-yard line. Washington then managed <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out</b> a 52-yard drive to put the game away, with Ervins rushing for 28 yards and Rypien converting two third downs with completions to receiver Gary Clark. He threw an incomplete pass intended for Ervins on third down from the 8, but Sanders was penalized for holding, giving Washington first and goal from the four. Riggs then took the ball into the end zone with two carries, the second a 1-yard rushing touchdown, giving Washington a 24-7 lead with 6:32 left in the game, prompting the fans in attendance to shower the field with the yellow seat cushions that were given out before the game and chant [...] "We want Dallas".|$|E

5000|$|Kallis {{has earned}} high praise for his {{orthodox}} batting technique. In {{an article for}} the Telegraph in July 2012, former England batsman and captain Michael Vaughan wrote that Kallis, [...] "as a batsman, is {{the best player in}} the world.". He described Kallis' batting in more detail:Whether on the front or back foot, he plays well on the on- and off-side. He’s not Brian Lara or Ricky Ponting in terms of aggression or flair but he is rock solid and, added to that, has every shot in the book.Also his cover drive and flick off the hip are right up there in terms of execution and attractiveness. ...

5000|$|Karakontie {{began his}} racing career at Compiegne on 1 July {{when he won}} the Prix du Mont Saint-Jean over 1400 metres, beating the {{favourite}} Ectot by one and a half lengths. In August he contested the Listed Prix Francois Boutin over the same distance at Deauville Racecourse and finished second, beaten a short-head by the British-trained colt Bunker. Four weeks later the colt was moved up in class for the Group Three Prix La Rochette at Longchamp Racecourse and started the 4/1 third favourite behind the Andre Fabre-trained Decathlete and the Aga Khan's colt Daraybi. Ridden for the first and only time by Olivier Peslier, he was towards the rear of the seven runner field, but finished strongly {{to take the lead in}} the final strides and won by three quarters of a length from Decathlete. Peslier said [...] "He was a little caught out when they first quickened up but he really picked up when it mattered". On 6 October, Karakontie was reunited with Pasquier and started 11/4 favourite for the Group One Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp. Pasquier positioned the colt behind the Spanish colt Noozhoh Canarias before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish and winning by three quarters of a length. Charm Spirit was a length and a quarter away in third ahead of the Anglesey Stakes winner Wilshire Boulevard and the British-trained Barley Mow.

[...] The resulting scandal led to the withdrawal of bone-crushing as an employment for those living in workhouses and the replacement of the Poor Law Commission by the Poor Law Board in 1847. Conditions thereafter were regulated according to a list of rules contained in the 1847 Consolidated General Order, which included guidance on issues such as diet, staff duties, dress, education, discipline and redress of grievances.|$|R
5000|$|On January 18, 2014, on Up with Steve Kornacki cable program, Zimmer {{said that}} Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs Rich Constable had, on two {{separate}} occasions in May 2013, pressured her {{to support a}} Rockefeller Group development project in Hoboken's North End {{in exchange for the}} city receiving additional federal Sandy relief aid. On January 20, appearing on a CNN cable program, Zimmer stated that a month earlier, Marc Ferzan, Director of the Governor's Office of Recovery and Rebuilding had also pressured her to support more development in exchange for federal Sandy recovery funds. Following her television appearances, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey met with Zimmer and reviewed and took as evidence a notebook journal in which she had written about the meetings. They also interviewed two of her aides and five other potential witnesses. Zimmer stated: “As their investigation proceeds, they have asked me to refrain from giving any additional interviews and I am respecting their request.” The Christie administration officials categorically denied the allegations, a spokesman saying [...] "It is very clear partisan politics are at play here as Democratic mayors with a political axe <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> come <b>out</b> of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television." [...] Zimmer said she had not come forward until after the so-called Bridgegate scandal (which had broke 10 days earlier) because she thought her claims would be not taken seriously.

5000|$|Johnson {{was born}} on January 28, 1983, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Lonnie Johnson and Elise Ramsey. He has one brother. When he was 17 years old, his father died of cancer. In December 2011, Carldell said that, [...] "My whole life, I’ve been trying <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> it <b>out</b> and work hard to get where I need to be. My father died from cancer, and I {{grew up in a}} tough {{neighborhood}} in (eastern) New Orleans, where guys would get bored and find time to get into other things, like stealing cars and walking around looking for fights. But Coach Tillman would always pick me up and have us going to practice, whether it was basketball season or not." [...] He attended John F. Kennedy High School in New Orleans and transferred to Marion Abramson High School for his senior year. At Abramson he played basketball under head coach Robert Tillman. Tillman was also Johnson's coach in AAU basketball. After high school, he was not recruited by any division one schools to play basketball, so he attended Salt Lake Community College, where he was the team's starting point guard. He averaged eight points and eight assists during his one season there.

60|$|The fact is, our {{process of}} {{universal}} education is to-day so uncouth, so psychologically barbaric, {{that it is}} the most terrible menace to the existence of our race. We seize hold of our children, and by parrot-compulsion we force into them a set of mental tricks. By unnatural and unhealthy compulsion we force them into a certain amount of cerebral activity. And then, after a few years, with a certain number of windmills in their heads, we turn them loose, like so many inferior Don Quixotes, to make a mess of life. All that they have learnt in their heads has no reference at all to their dynamic souls. The windmills spin and spin in a wind of words, Dulcinea del Toboso beckons round every corner, and our nation of inferior Quixotes jumps on and off tram-cars, trains, bicycles, motor-cars, buses, in one mad chase of the divine Dulcinea, who is all the time chewing chocolates and feeling very, very bored.

60|$|But {{anything}} {{that appealed to}} the sense of beauty, in however humble a way, did not require to be recommended by these old associations. This was observable when one of those Italian boys (who are rather a modern feature of our streets) came along with his barrel-organ, and stopped under the wide and cool shadows of the elm. With his quick professional eye he took note of the two faces watching him from the arched window, and, opening his instrument, began to scatter its melodies abroad. He had a monkey on his shoulder, dressed in a Highland plaid; and, to complete the sum of splendid attractions wherewith he presented himself to the public, there was a company of little figures, whose sphere and habitation was in the mahogany case of his organ, and whose principle of life was the music which the Italian made it his business <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>out.</b> In all their variety of occupation,--the cobbler, the blacksmith, the soldier, the lady with her fan, the toper with his bottle, the milk-maid sitting by her cow--this fortunate little society might truly be said to enjoy a harmonious existence, and to make life literally a dance. The Italian turned a crank; and, behold! every one of these small individuals started into the most curious vivacity. The cobbler wrought upon a shoe; the blacksmith hammered his iron, the soldier waved his glittering blade; the lady raised a tiny breeze with her fan; the jolly toper swigged lustily at his bottle; a scholar opened his book with eager thirst for knowledge, and turned his head to and fro along the page; the milkmaid energetically drained her cow; and a miser counted gold into his strong-box,--all at the same turning of a crank. Yes; and, moved by the self-same impulse, a lover saluted his mistress on her lips! Possibly some cynic, at once merry and bitter, had desired to signify, in this pantomimic scene, that we mortals, whatever our business or amusement,--however serious, however trifling,--all dance to one identical tune, and, in spite of our ridiculous activity, bring nothing finally to pass. For the most remarkable aspect of the affair was, that, at the cessation of the music, everybody was petrified at once, from the most extravagant life into a dead torpor. Neither was the cobbler's shoe finished, nor the blacksmith's iron shaped out; nor was there a drop less of brandy in the toper's bottle, nor a drop more of milk in the milkmaid's pail, nor one additional coin in the miser's strong-box, nor was the scholar a page deeper in his book. All were precisely in the same condition as before they made themselves so ridiculous by their haste to toil, to enjoy, to accumulate gold, and to become wise. Saddest of all, moreover, the lover was none the happier for the maiden's granted kiss! But, rather than swallow this last too acrid ingredient, we reject the whole moral of the show.|$|E
