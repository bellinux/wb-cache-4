5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
