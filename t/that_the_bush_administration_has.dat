Some members of the International Association of Emergency Managers had predicted that FEMA could not adequately respond to a catastrophe due to the integration and staffing overlaps. President Bush was criticized for appointing Michael D. Brown as FEMA head. Prior to joining FEMA, Brown had no experience in disaster relief and had even been fired from his previous job as a supervisor of judging at the International Arabian Horse Association. After closer scrutiny prompted by FEMA's coordination efforts with local officials before Hurricane Katrina, {{it was found that}} Brown had [...] "mis-represented" [...] several of his credentials which lower staffers had not discovered when vetting him for Presidential appointment to his position.

40|$|The Bush administrations Freedom Car {{initiative}} aims {{to establish}} the Fuel-Cell Vehicle (FCV) {{as a replacement for}} the internal combustion engine. However, the administration seems to have taken this stance {{in the absence of an}} explicit study confirming that FCVs are superior to the only other zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) alternative, the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). Based on an automobile model that is characteristic of the largest segment of light-duty vehicles, results are presented from widely cited government studies of FCV and BEV technology to show that the BEV is far more favorable than the FCV in terms of performance, cost, and energy efficiency. The differences are particularly dramatic when we assume that energy is derived from renewable resources. Our results suggest, that for this important class of vehicles, BEVs would be more likely than FCVs to meet consumer demands. This is striking, in light of the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> chosen to direct federal support away from BEV development...|$|E

40|$|This article, {{after giving}} {{a brief history}} of the Moussaoui case, {{identifies}} the main paradoxes or problems of continuing to deal with him in the criminal system. By no stretch of the imagination does this article provide an exhaustive or comprehensive treatment of the Moussaoui case. Each problem, by itself, could be the subject of a separate law review article. This article suggests that Moussaoui, rather than Yaser Esam Hamdi, or Jose Padilla, or the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, could have served as the true test for determining the minimum process that the American Constitutional system owes to an individual whose goal is our annihilation. The distinction between the Moussaoui case and the Hamdi/Padilla cases is that Moussaoui is not a U. S. citizen. The distinction between the Moussaoui case and the Hamdi/Padilla/Guantanamo cases is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> offered more convincing evidence in public filings that Moussaoui was a major player connected to a major terrorist plot. The premise of this article is that we should respect our rule of law but that we should not treat terrorists any more decently than required. To do more than the law requires, in an age of weapons of mass destruction, is more folly than an act of humanity. Although this article does not address the case of a non-U. S. citizen who is a major player arrested outside the United States, it follows that someone like Khaled Sheik Mohammed (KSM), the alleged mastermind of the 9 / 11 plot, should not be treated any better than Moussaoui. This article’s conclusion is that the Moussaoui case is better resolved through a military proceeding...|$|E
