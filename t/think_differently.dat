He felt animals <b>think</b> <b>differently</b> from humans, though are capable of reason on a [...] "rudimentary level compared to a human." [...] In explaining his descriptions of hunting, {{he said it was}} hard to decide how a hound with non-human scenting ability interprets and responds to scents while tracking another animal.|$|E
