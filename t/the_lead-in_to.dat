5|$|While the {{dramatic}} {{portions of the}} movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot {{in a number of}} different ways. <b>The</b> <b>lead-in</b> <b>to</b> the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Giant" [...] modules {{were set}} in the Greyhawk {{campaign}} setting, and formed <b>the</b> <b>lead-in</b> <b>to</b> an overall campaign that then continued on an odyssey into the Underdark. These adventures included the [...] "Drow" [...] series of modules, Descent into the Depths of the Earth, Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, and Vault of the Drow. The campaign finally culminated with module Queen of the Demonweb Pits. [...] Steading and Glacial Rift were eight pages long, while Hall was 16 pages in length, and each featured an outer folder. The omnibus collection combination module Against the Giants was 32 pages long, and featured two outer folders. Against the Giants was revised and reprinted in the 128-page supermodule Queen of the Spiders in 1986 {{in combination with the}} three [...] "Drow" [...] series modules, and Queen of the Demonweb Pits. Hall of the Fire Giant King marked the first time that Dungeons & Dragons players encountered the drow; game statistics for the drow first appear in the module, although drow are mentioned in the 1977 edition of the Monster Manual. At the time these modules were released, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The earlier modules have module codes G1, G2, and G3 respectively, and the combined module's code is G13. [...] The [...] "G" [...] in the module code represents the first letter in the word [...] "giant". [...] The Original TSR Product Codes for these 3 modules are 9016, 9017, and 9018 respectively.

During the show's fourth season, Richard Dean Anderson complained that ABC was not {{marketing}} the series enough.

She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs out of her mouth as another oddity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commented that Birdo is [...] "the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo". He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female.

50|$|When {{automatic}} record changers, auto replay adapters and jukeboxes {{began appearing}} in the 1920s the need arose to find a more reliable and forgiving way to accurately direct the stylus {{to the start of}} the recorded area as well as signal the end of a performance. Appearing near the outer edge of the record and leading the stylus inward to the performance, Decca introduced <b>the</b> <b>lead-in</b> groove in 1935 in the USA, with the industry following soon thereafter. Lead-in groove length, positioning and motion varied by manufacturer and era, some moving slower, some requiring several revolutions before encountering audio, while others being very short and jerky. As with the recorded locked groove at the end, it is possible to record sound into <b>the</b> <b>lead-in</b> groove. King Crimson's USA (mentioned above) has this feature. George Harrison's Wonderwall Music and the Dead Kennedys' Plastic Surgery Disasters also start in <b>the</b> <b>lead-in</b> groove. Many Telarc classical LP's began the music near the end of <b>the</b> <b>lead-in</b> groove <b>to</b> avoid pre-echo (caused by wide groove modulations following a number of closely spaced silent grooves).|$|R
