40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the addition to milk, 5 min and 10 h before its consumption, of a lactase obtained from Kluyveromyces lactis in lactose malabsorbers with intolerance. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. SETTING: University Hospital. SUBJECTS: In total, 11 male and 19 female (aged from 18 to 65 y, mean age 43. 3 y) lactose malabsorbers with intolerance participated. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient underwent three H(2) breath tests, in a random order. We used 400 ml of cow's semiskimmed milk as substrate and a beta-galactosidase obtained from K. lactis. The test A was carried out adding to the milk the enzyme (3000 UI), 10 h before its consumption; the test B was performed adding the beta-galactosidase (6000 UI) 5 min before milk ingestion and the <b>test</b> <b>C</b> was made using placebo. We evaluated the maximum breath H(2) concentration, the cumulative H(2) excretion and a clinical score based on intolerance symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea). RESULTS: Our study showed a significant reduction of the mean maximum H(2) concentration after both test A (12. 07 +/- 7. 8 p. p. m.) and test B (13. 97 +/- 7. 99 p. p. m.) compared with <b>test</b> <b>C</b> (51. 46 +/- 16. 12 p. p. m.) (ANOVA F = 54. 33, P < 0. 001). Similarly, there was a significant reduction of the mean cumulative H(2) excretion after both test A (1428 +/- 1156 p. p. m.) and test B (1761 +/- 966 p. p. m.) compared with <b>test</b> <b>C</b> (5795 +/- 2707 p. p. m.) (ANOVA F = 31. 46, P < 0. 001). We also observed a significant reduction of the mean clinical score after both test A (0. 36 +/- 0. 55) and test B (0. 96 +/- 0. 85) compared with <b>test</b> <b>C</b> (3. 7 +/- 0. 79) (ANOVA F = 106. 81, P < 0. 001). Moreover, with regard to the mean clinical score, there was a significant reduction after test A with respect to test B (Bonferroni's P = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in lactose malabsorbers with intolerance, the lactase obtained from K. lactis can represent a valid therapeutic strategy, with objective and subjective efficacy and without side effects...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{modification}} {{to the training}} process of the popular SPLICE algorithm has been proposed for noise robust speech recognition. The modification is based on feature correlations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the performance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the modified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and noisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. Finally, an MLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE framework has been proposed.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of fuel injection distribution on the scramjet combustor performance, there are conducted three sets of test on a hydrocarbon fueled direct-connect scramjet test facility. The results of Test A, whose fuel injection is carried out with injectors located on the top-wall and the bottom-wall, show that the fuel injection with an appropriate close-front and centralized distribution would be of much help to optimize combustor performances. The results of Test B, whose fuel injection is performed at the optimal injection locations found in Test A, with a given equivalence ratio and different injection proportions for each injector, show that this injection mode is of little benefit to improve combustor performances. The results of <b>Test</b> <b>C</b> with a circumferential fuel injection distribution displaies the possibility of ameliorating combustor performance. By analyzing the effects of injection location parameters on combustor performances {{on the base of}} the data of <b>Test</b> <b>C,</b> {{it is clear that the}} injector location has strong coupled influences on combustor performances. In addition, an inner-force synthesis specific impulse is used to reduce the errors caused by the disturbance of fuel supply and working state of air heater while assessing combustor performances...|$|E

40|$|Seven-day {{tests with}} Ceriodaphnia dubia are {{commonly}} used to estimate toxicity of effluents or receiving waters but can sometimes yield {open_quotes}no toxicity{close_quotes} outcomes even if pollutants are present. We conducted two sets of full life-cycle <b>tests</b> with <b>C.</b> dubia to (1) see if tests with longer exposure periods would reveal evidence for toxicity {{that might not be}} evident from 7 -day tests, and (2) determine the relative importance of water quality versus food as factors influencing C. dubia reproduction. In the first set of <b>tests,</b> <b>C.</b> dubia was reared in diluted mineral water (negative control), water from a stream impacted by coal fly-ash, or water from a retention basin containing sediments contaminated with mercury, other metals and polychlorinated biphenyls. The second set of tests used water from the retention basin only, but this water was either filtered or not filtered, and food was either added or not added, prior to <b>testing.</b> <b>C.</b> dubia survival and reproduction did not differ much among the three water types in the first set of tests, but these two parameters were strongly affected by the filtering and food-addition treatments in the second set of <b>tests.</b> Thus, <b>C.</b> dubia appeared to be relatively insensitive to general water-quality factors, but quite sensitive to food-related factors. Regression analyses showed that the predictability of life-time reproduction by C. dubia from the results of 7 -day tests was very low (R{sup 2 }< 0. 35) in five of the six experiments. The increase in predictability as a function of test duration also differed among water types in the first set of tests, and among treatments in the second set of tests. Thus, 7 -day <b>tests</b> with <b>C.</b> dubia may be used to quantify water-quality problems, {{but it may not be}} possible to reliably extrapolate the results of these tests to longer time scales...|$|R
