5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings,</b> Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings</b> and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings,</b> the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
5|$|Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes rival {{photographer}} Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depicted Spider-Man as a criminal. Soon afterward, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to {{the nightclub}} where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hurting Mary Jane, {{he realizes that}} the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the symbiote weakens when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings.</b> Peter is able to remove the symbiote, and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who had been praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to Brock, transforming him into Venom. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter. Brock hijacks a taxi with Mary Jane on board, and hangs it as bait from a web above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter on Harry's glider, but Harry intervenes and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom, and allowing Peter to separate Brock and the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the symbiote, but Brock dives in, and the bomb kills them both.|$|E

25|$|UGA {{students}} traditionally {{ring the}} school's Chapel Bell until midnight following any home football win. However, when UGA beats Tech, <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings</b> all night long. Tech {{has a similar}} tradition with its whistle. UGA's Chapel Bell and Georgia Tech's Ramblin' Wreck have been rumored to have been stolen numerous times by their respective rival before, after, or even during major sporting events between the two schools. The bulldog statue in front of UGA's Memorial Hall was once stolen by Tech students. The culprits put the UGA and Tech police on a scavenger hunt to find the missing statue. Many fans of the respective institutions refuse to even partake in clothing, food, or other materials of their rival's school colors. Examples include Georgia fans refusing to eat mustard or Georgia Tech fans refusing to use red pens.|$|E

50|$|Under Father Fitzmaurice many {{improvements}} and additions {{were made to}} <b>the</b> church. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> tower was constructed by a local contractor, James T. Murphy. The tower was completed in 1912. It was this bell that became {{a major part of}} everyone’s lives in Frankford. It is told that at 7am when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> everyone knew {{it was time to get}} up and go to work; at noon when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> lunch, and at 6pm when <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> again <b>the</b> family would gather and share dinner together. In 1914, a marble altar, wainscoating, flooring and rail were added. The stone was supplied by the Vermont Marble Company.|$|R

500|$|In 2007 and 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel {{short series}} As <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> <b>Rings.</b> Lovato auditioned for the channel's {{television}} film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles. Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9million viewers. Its soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, {{the music was}} considered less current than that of High School Musical. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and she [...] "has the knee-jerk smile {{of someone who is}} often told she has a great smile". Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including [...] "We Rock" [...] and [...] "This Is Me". That summer, she began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut album and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.|$|E
500|$|Lovato was {{discovered}} by Disney Channel during an open call audition {{in her hometown of}} Dallas, Texas and made her debut on the short series As <b>the</b> <b>Bell</b> <b>Rings</b> in 2007. She subsequently auditioned for a role on the television series Jonas, but did not get the part. Instead, she received the main role in the musical film Camp Rock after singing for the network executives. Later, she auditioned for a role on the series Sonny with a Chance, which she also received. Lovato enlisted the Jonas Brothers, her Camp Rock co-stars, to work with her on her debut studio album, Don't Forget (2008). The writing began during the filming of Camp Rock in 2007 and continued on the band's Look Me in the Eyes Tour in 2008. Lovato wanted to establish herself as a musician with the album, and not being known as just [...] "the girl from Camp Rock." [...] She said that her goal was to have fun on the album and that she would tackle deeper themes on her sophomore effort.|$|E
500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} bell, Norris {{instructed}} Charles {{to order a}} second one, and see if Lester and Pack would take back the first bell and credit {{the value of the}} metal towards the bill. In 1754, the Assembly decided to keep both bells; the new one was attached to the tower clock while the old bell was, by vote of the Assembly, devoted [...] "to such Uses as this House may hereafter appoint." [...] The Pass and Stow bell was used to summon the Assembly. One of the earliest documented mentions of the bell's use is in a letter from Benjamin Franklin to Catherine Ray dated October 16, 1755: [...] "Adieu. <b>The</b> <b>Bell</b> <b>rings,</b> and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politiks." [...] The bell was rung in 1760 to mark the accession of George III to the throne. In the early 1760s, the Assembly allowed a local church to use the State House for services and the bell to summon worshipers, while the church's building was being constructed. The bell was also used to summon people to public meetings, and in 1772, a group of citizens complained to the Assembly that the bell was being rung too frequently.|$|E

500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to {{fade into the}} background of the activity. Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings</b> perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2010 Rey de Reyes the {{original}} La Parka, L.A. Park, returned to AAA 13 {{years after he}} left on bad terms to work a storyline feud against the [...] "impostor" [...] La Parka. L.A. Park sided with Dorian Roldan in his feud with his father Joaquin Roldan (president of AAA) while La Parka sided with Joaquin. During an AAA show on March 19, 2010 L.A. Park attacked La Parka once again and threw him through a table. At a later show the two had another brawl, after which La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemania XVIII, under any stipulation {{the original}} Parka wanted. During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A. Park accepted La Parka's challenge for a match at Triplemania XVIII. At an AAA press conference on May 12, 2010 {{it was announced that}} the match between the two would be for the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". The two signed the official contract for the match during a television taping on May 19, 2010. After signing the contract Dorian Roldan had the police arrest La Parka for piracy by impersonating La Parka. He was released just in time to run in during the semi-main event to attack L.A. Park. At Triplemania XVIII L.A. Park faced La Parka in the main event of the show. Near the end of the match Park used a tombstone piledriver, a move that is illegal in Lucha Libre. Joaquin Roldan entered the ring, when L.A. Park attempted to use a steel chair on La Parka. When L.A. Park teased using the chair on Joaquin instead, Dorian entered the ring to protest, but was pushed down by Park, who then hit Joaquin with the chair, which caused Dorian to turn on him, hitting him with a steel chair three times. Halloween and Damián 666 from the Perros del Mal wrestling promotion run to the ring to chase Dorian Roldan away. Then they drag L.A. Park on top of La Parka before rudo referee Hijo del Tirantes counts for three to give L.A. Park the victory. After <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rings</b> the rest of Los Perros del Mal (including Park's son Hijo de L.A. Park) came to the ring to celebrate with L.A. Park, who had won the rights to the name [...] "La Parka". After a couple of minutes a group of AAA wrestlers led by Octagón came to ringside and in combination with the arena security managed to remove Los Perros del Mal from the ring. La Parka was taken from the ring on a stretcher, not having moved since L.A. Park applied the piledriver. A bit later it was announced that the match results had been thrown out due to interference by Los Perros del Mal, but the following morning it was confirmed that Tapia had indeed won and would now be known as [...] "La Parka" [...] once again and that AAA's La Parka would have to change his name. However, on June 10 AAA announced that it would respect Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission's decision to throw out the match and as a result both La Parka and L.A. Park would keep their names. On July 4 La Parka defeated L.A. Park in a rematch.|$|E
2500|$|On March 12, 2010, {{during the}} 2010 Rey de Reyes event Dorian Roldan, son of AAA boss Joaquin Roldan {{announced}} that he, Dorian, {{was going to}} take control of the promotion and that he had some help to do so. That help turned out to be L.A. Park, the original La Parka returning to AAA after years and years of legal battles and threats. After unveiling himself during the show L.A. Park announced that he was siding with Konnan and Dorian Roldan, targeting the [...] "impostor Parka". In order to maintain the illusion that L.A. Park did not really work for AAA, L.A. Park claimed that he came to AAA to beat up La Parka, and since he had done that already he was not sure if he even felt like returning to AAA. L.A. Park did however return to an AAA ring as he had another brawl with La Parka on their April 18 television taping. During the event La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemania XVIII, under any stipulation the original Parka wanted. During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A.
