5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously {{as a political}} entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> Thousands of workers joined the union {{over the next few}} years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady allies of the union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E
