5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car pulled}} off the track {{at the end of}} lap twenty-three and the race resumed with Vettel leading from Alonso and Hamilton. Vettel began to {{gradually}} pull clear {{from the rest of the}} field. On the twenty-fourth lap while battling with Senna for twenty-first place, Trulli collided with Senna after attempting a passing manoeuvre around the inside; Trulli's front wing was knocked off. Trulli drove to his garage for repairs. Button, who was in fifth, started to place Massa under pressure on the same lap. Kobayashi passed Yamamoto on lap twenty-six but ran wide and fell down the order, while Trulli rejoined the race. Di Grassi lost control of his car at turn fourteen after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Yamamoto on lap twenty-seven; he made light contact with the wall which caused him to retire.|$|E

5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> as many checkpoints {{as possible before}} time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{running in}} {{practice}} and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race {{at the tail end of}} the field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly looked as if he had the pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to fade in the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E

25|$|The {{morning of}} the race, Earnhardt {{appeared}} confident and relaxed. Earnhardt was a front-runner throughout the race, leading 17 laps.

Mansell quickly passed Alesi to lead and then pulled away. Prost and Senna were battling for third and Prost went wide at a corner <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Senna {{allowing}} Patrese to take fourth.|$|E

25|$|Barbed wire {{is a type}} of fencing wire {{constructed}} with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. It is used to construct inexpensive fences and is used atop walls surrounding secured property. It is also a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare. A person or animal <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices such as staples. On June 25, 1867, Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio, patented barbed wire. Shortly thereafter, several other inventors, such as Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois, patented inventions for similar products, but Smith patented his first, allowing him to claim that he invented barbed wire.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E
25|$|Following its independence, the Philippines {{has seen}} both small and {{large-scale}} immigration into the country, mostly involving American, European, Chinese and Japanese peoples. After World War II, South Asians continued to migrate into the islands, {{most of which}} assimilated and avoided the local social stigma instilled by the early Spaniards against them by keeping a low profile and/or by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> as Spanish mestizos. This was also true for the Arab and Chinese immigrants, {{many of whom are}} also post WWII arrivals. More recent migrations into the country by Koreans, Persians, Brazilians, and other Southeast Asians have contributed to the enrichment of the country's ethnic landscape, language and culture. Centuries of migration, diaspora, assimilation, and cultural diversity made most Filipinos accepting of interracial marriage and multiculturalism.|$|E

25|$|Majeski {{was named}} one of the seven finalists for the inaugural Alan Kulwicki Driver Development Program in 2015. Participants were awarded $7777 to help develop their careers. He raced a similar {{schedule}} in 2015, starting with a seven-night series at New Smyrna Speedway for the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing. Majeski won the second program on Tuesday night and lead the series points for two nights. In July 2015, Speed51.com had ranked him #4 on their short track power ranking with seven victories. At the Slinger Nationals, Majeski started 20th and passed up to second place. While battling for the lead {{near the end of the}} race, he got into an incident while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a lapped car and restarted at the back of the lead lap cars to finish fourth.|$|E
25|$|As with Fred Holroyd and John Weir, {{there were}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts to undermine Colin Wallace. Barron notes that Wallace was {{targeted by the}} same security services he had served. He {{was forced to resign}} in 1975, ostensibly for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a classified document to journalist Robert Fisk. Wallace claims the real reasons for his dismissal were his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project, and his discovery that the security forces were involved in a child sex abuse ring. After his dismissal, Wallace attempted to expose these scandals, as well as state collusion with loyalists. In 1980, shortly after making some of his allegations, he was arrested and convicted of manslaughter. He was released on parole in 1985 and proclaimed his innocence. Various people have alleged that Wallace was framed. He later had his conviction overturned and was paid £30,000 compensation for unjust dismissal from government service. His role within the British Army intelligence service had been officially, albeit belatedly, acknowledged in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Vettel took {{poles in}} Germany and Hungary {{but failed to}} win either race, taking third places in both races. Webber {{suffered}} {{a problem with a}} lack of oil in the engine of his car, and finished sixth at Hockenheim. At the Hungaroring, the Red Bull cars were the pacesetters, and Webber won the race after capitalising on a drive-through penalty for Vettel, for falling over ten lengths behind Webber during a safety car period. With victory, Webber returned {{to the top of the}} championship, while Red Bull took the lead in the Constructors' Championship. In Belgium, Webber took pole while Vettel qualified fourth. In the race, Webber finished second behind Hamilton, while Vettel lost control of the car <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Jenson Button, damaging his own front wing and ending Button's race by damaging his car's radiators. Vettel immediately pitted for a new front wing and appeared to be threatening to regain a points-scoring position before he sustained a puncture to his right-rear tyre after clipping Vitantonio Liuzzi's front wing during an attempted overtake; eventually finishing a lap down in 15th.|$|E
