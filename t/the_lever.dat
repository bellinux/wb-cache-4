5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> in the forward position for horizontal flight. With <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
30|$|Equation (4) {{also shows}} that higher debt {{relative}} to equity, i.e., a higher leverage, scales up <b>the</b> <b>levered</b> beta. With higher leverage relatively more debt payments {{have to be made}} from the cash flows coming from the firm’s assets. The remaining diminished cash flows go to equity holders. The return of those cash flows have a higher absolute value of the beta than before the increase in leverage. For positive unlevered beta <b>the</b> <b>levered</b> beta increases. If the unlevered beta is negative, <b>the</b> <b>levered</b> beta decreases. Appendix 1 shows how this occurs.|$|R
50|$|In July 1908, Ardeshir {{with his}} brother Pirojsha applied for and were granted (in October 1909) a British patent for the world's first springless lock. Until then, <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> in <b>the</b> locks were pushed into their resting place with springs, which were prone to dirt and breakage, that when jammed or broken, left <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> in an open position. Moreover, the varying {{resistance}} of <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> aided a skilled burglar that attempted to pick the lock. The springless lock, which in the patent certificate is attributed to Pirojsha, brought the brothers a fortune.|$|R

5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis {{the use of}} Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). Paul I also {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded this allowance. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled Réflexions Historiques sur Marie Antoinette. He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> and coucher (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E

50|$|First {{invented in}} 1939, a wing corkscrew, {{sometimes}} called a butterfly corkscrew or angel corkscrew, has two levers, one {{on either side}} of the worm. As the worm is twisted into <b>the</b> cork, <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> are raised. Pushing down <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> draws <b>the</b> cork from the bottle in one smooth motion. The most common design has a rack and pinion connecting <b>the</b> <b>levers</b> to <b>the</b> body. The head of the central shaft is frequently modified to form a bottle opener, increasing the utility of the device. Corkscrews of this design are particularly popular in household use.|$|R

5|$|The final {{match on}} the card was the main event, which saw The Undertaker face off against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) in a Handicap match. Per the pre-match stipulation, Paul Bearer would be {{cemented}} in a glass crypt if Undertaker lost. Throughout {{the duration of the}} match, Bearer was locked on a chair inside a glass crypt with the pump of cement truck above him. After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys, Undertaker pinned D-Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win. After the match, Undertaker pulled <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> to the cement truck, which in turn filled the crypt with Bearer inside full of cement.|$|E
5|$|A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-{{sponsored}} the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act which banned alcohol {{sales in}} Washington, D.C. It {{was passed in}} 1917. He sponsored an amendment to <b>the</b> <b>Lever</b> Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility {{and set the stage}} for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto <b>the</b> <b>lever.</b> It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the closed-form modeling of an XY flexure-based nano-manipulator developed {{in our previous}} work [28]. In this nano-manipulator, the flexure hinges are arranged in SIS configurations to transmit linear or angular motions. Analytical modeling reveals that <b>the</b> <b>lever’s</b> compliance significantly increases the estimation error. Thus, a threshold is proposed to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>lever’s</b> compliance can be neglected or not. Subsequently, a systematic modeling methodology is established to investigate {{the behavior of the}} nano-manipulator during linear and angular motions. Experimental results show that the modeling accuracy is significantly improved if the influence of <b>the</b> <b>lever’s</b> compliance, <b>the</b> contact stiffness, and the load mass is taken into consideration.|$|R

5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed to hold on to <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of <b>the</b> <b>lever,</b> the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including <b>the</b> <b>Lever</b> Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging <b>the</b> <b>lever</b> arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
