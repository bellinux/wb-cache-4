In the verses, Cyrus addresses confidence and the attempt to discover for what she is yearning for, respectively. Choruses have Cyrus shouting the title and variations {{of it in a}} repetitive manner, against the beat of the song. Monica Herrera of Billboard interpreted the lyrics [...] "If there was a question about my intentions, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>ya</b> / I'm not here to sell ya" [...] to be an official declaration of rebellion in order to dispose herself of tween role-model responsibilities.

2500|$|While both {{fighters were}} the same age (23), Corrales had several {{physical}} advantages over Mayweather: two inches in height, an inch in reach and (despite both arriving at the official weight-in at the 130-lb super-featherweight limit) unofficially 146lbs, versus Mayweather's 136½ lbs. In the bout, Mayweather won every round and knocked down Corrales five times (three times in round 7 and twice in round 10). After the fifth knockdown, Corrales' cornermen climbed onto the apron and stopped the fight, thereby establishing Mayweather as a claimant to boxing's mythical pound-for-pound title. At {{the time of the}} stoppage Mayweather was ahead on the scorecards, leading by 89–79, 90–79, and 90–78. Throughout the fight, HBO commentators analyzed Mayweather.

2500|$|Lewis {{played the}} Grand Ole Opry {{for the first}} time on January 20, 1973. [...] As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to A Half Century of Hits, Lewis had always {{maintained}} ambivalent feelings towards Music City ever since he'd been turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at Sun Records: [...] "It was 18 years since he had left Nashville broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. [...] He didn't move there and didn't schmooze there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different." [...] When Lewis finally took the stage, he broke just about every rule the Opry had. [...] As recounted in a 2015 online Rolling Stone article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single [...] "Another Place, Another Time" [...] and then announced to the audience, [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>ya</b> something about Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and gentlemen: I am a rock and rollin', country-and-western, rhythm and blues-singin' motherfucker!" [...] Ignoring his allotted time constraints – and, thus, commercial breaks – Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight maximum minutes of stage time) and invited Del Wood – the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager – out on stage to sing with him. [...] He also blasted through [...] "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On", [...] "Workin' Man Blues", [...] "Good Golly Miss Molly", and a host of others classics before leaving the stage to a thunderous standing ovation.|$|E

[...] When Fowler reminded Clinton that Purdum is married to his former press secretary, he responded: [...] "That's all right - he's still a scumbag" [...] and later added [...] "He's just a dishonest guy - can't help it."

6000|$|Far {{different}} was {{the attitude}} of Mrs. Crocker's sister, Nesta Pett. She entirely disapproved of the proposed match. At least, {{the fact that in}} her final interview with her sister she described the bridegroom-to-be as a wretched mummer, a despicable fortune-hunter, a broken-down tramp, and a sneaking, grafting confidence-trickster lends colour to the supposition that she was not a warm supporter of it. She agreed wholeheartedly with Mrs. Crocker's suggestion that they should never speak to each other again as long as they lived: and it was immediately after this that the latter removed husband Bingley, step-son Jimmy, and all her other goods and chattels to London, where they had remained ever since. Whenever Mrs. Crocker spoke of America now, it was in tones of the deepest dislike and contempt. Her friends were English, and every year more exclusively of England's aristocracy. She intended to become a leading figure in London Society, and already her progress had been astonishing. She knew the right people, lived in the right square, said the right things, and thought the right thoughts: and in the Spring of her third year had succeeded in curing Bingley of his habit of beginning his remarks with the words [...] "Say, lemme <b>tell</b> <b>ya</b> something."

50|$|As Hyuga walks {{his beloved}} Yae {{back to the}} main road after saving her from the three brothers, he is confronted by Saru and Bijomaru, and a battle between the assassin and the {{mercenary}} ensues. During the battle, Bijomaru uses psychological warfare in addition to swordplay as he explains to a frightened Hyuga that his sword does not contain a hand-guard since he has never had to defend another's blow. As Hyuga lays bleeding and defeated, Bijomaru forces Yae to watch him toy with the dying boy. Saru, uncomfortable with this lack of respect for another warrior, finishes Hyuga off as an act of mercy, and gives Yae leave to bury him. Azumi soon finds Yae by Hyuga's body, and Yae manages to convince her that the violent lifestyle must be left behind. Together they begin a journey over the mountains and out of the valley to go and live in peace with Yae's kin in Tangou. Yae socializes Azumi during the journey, dressing her in a kimono and adorning her with make-up, perfume and hair treatment. Just as they begin to get comfortable during their journey, a band of brigands finds them as they sleep, and attempts to gang rape the young women. Azumi, who has not slept beside her sword as her training normally dictated, is caught off guard, but eventually steals the sword of a would-be captor, killing all of the brigands and saving Yae. The experience leaves Azumi understanding that she must obey her training, and complete her mission. She sets off to find her master and comrades, and <b>tells</b> <b>Yae</b> that she will meet her later, in Tangou.|$|R

500|$|Barney Hoskyns {{describes}} [...] "Heylin's objections [...] {{the academic}} ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained {{some of the}} greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." [...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't <b>Ya</b> <b>Tell</b> Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break." ...|$|R
5000|$|Heartbeat is {{an album}} by Curtis Mayfield. This 1979 {{offering}} mixed disco rhythms with soul balladeering.

5000|$|Live at Watkins Glen is a 1995 album by the Band, {{presented}} by Capitol Records (without the band's involvement) as a live album from the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen rock festival held outside Watkins Glen, New York, on July 28, 1973 {{in front of}} 600,000 people.

500|$|Engineer Rob Fraboni {{was brought}} to Shangri-La {{to clean up the}} {{recordings}} still in the possession of Hudson, the original engineer. Fraboni had worked on Dylan's Planet Waves album, with backing by The Band, and the live Dylan–Band album Before the Flood, both released in 1974. Fraboni has described Robertson as the dominant voice in selecting the final tracks for The Basement Tapes and reported that Dylan was not in the studio very often. The stereo recordings made by Hudson were remixed to mono, while Robertson and other members of The Band overdubbed new keyboard, guitar, and drum parts onto some of the 1967 Woodstock recordings. According to Fraboni, four new songs by The Band were also recorded in preparation for the album's official release, one of which, a cover of Chuck Berry's [...] "Going Back to Memphis", did not end up being included. There is disagreement about the recording date of the other three songs: [...] "Bessie Smith", [...] "Ain't No More Cane" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Ya</b> <b>Tell</b> Henry". While Fraboni has recalled that The Band taped them in 1975, the liner notes for the reissued versions of The Band's own albums state that these songs were recorded between 1967 and 1970. Ultimately, eight of the twenty-four songs on The Basement Tapes did not feature Dylan, several of the studio outtakes postdating the sessions at Big Pink. In justifying their inclusion, Robertson explained that he, Hudson and Dylan did not have access to all the basement recordings: [...] "We had access to some of the songs. Some of these things came under the heading of 'homemade' which meant a Basement Tape to us." [...] Robertson has suggested that the Basement Tapes are, for him, [...] "a process, a homemade feel" [...] and so could include recordings {{from a wide variety of}} sources.|$|R
