McGregor, [...] British Columbia Supreme Court justice Irving wrote: “An {{action of}} {{replevin}} may be brought (1) where goods have been wrongfully distrained or (2) where goods have been otherwise, i.e. otherwise than by distress, wrongfully taken or detained. The word ‘wrongfully’ is applicable to both cases. ‘Wrongfully’ ... imports the infringement of some right, and any invasion {{of the civil rights}} of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history of replevin action in England is traced (as) ... ‘The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods. Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right <b>to</b> <b>replevy</b> to the party who could maintain trespass or trover. It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three actions, trespass, trover and replevin are classed... as actions of tort, I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.” ...|$|E
40|$|De acuerdo con Foucault, Kant estableció la misión del filosofar como ontología del presente, sin embargo, al aplicar las lecciones a nuestra era, todo parece indicar que deberíamos abandonar sus aseveraciones llenos de esperanza en la gradual ilustración moral y política de la especie humana, y concluir, con Benjamin, en honor a la memoria de los vencidos, que “cada acto de la civilización es un acto de la barbarie”. O tal vez la distancia entre la escatología racionalista del filósofo de Könisgberg y el {{memorial}} agonista del pensador de Berlín, no es tan amplia, ya que en ambos casos se intenta reivindicar la dignidad humana, en Kant, para que ésta sea posible, en Benjamin para que la indignidad no se repita. //// According to Foucault, Kant {{established the}} mission of philosophizing as ontology of the present, however when applying the lessons to our era everything {{seems to indicate that}} we should abandon his announcements full of hope on the gradual moral and political illustration of human kind and conclude, with Benjamin, after the memory of the defeated that “every act of civilization is an act of barbarity”. Or perhaps the distance between the rationalist scatology of the philosopher of Könisgsberg and the agonistic memorial of the thinker of Berlin is not so large, since in both cases they intend <b>to</b> <b>replevy</b> human dignity, in Kant for the sake of making it possible, in Benjamin for the indignity not to be repeated...|$|E
