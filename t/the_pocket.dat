5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided to isolate <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired {{into the area}} over several days. An attempt to capture <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> between 15 and 20 June.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese attack did not {{delay the}} Australian assault on <b>the</b> <b>Pocket.</b> At 10 am on 21 June, C Company of the 2/28th Battalion began {{to advance to}} the west along Lushington Ridge, and D Company moved south from Eastman Spur. D Company was {{supported}} by a troop of three conventional Matilda tanks and two Frog flamethrowers. C Company advanced about half of the way into <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> before being halted by Norman who was concerned that they might be accidentally attacked by D Company, which was also making good progress. The force built around D Company subsequently completed the occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Pocket,</b> with the flamethrower tanks playing a key role. The Japanese soldiers who had survived the artillery bombardment offered little resistance to the Australian forces. The 24th Brigade assessed that 60 Japanese personnel were killed in the final assault on <b>the</b> <b>Pocket,</b> with 117 being killed by the artillery bombardment which had preceded it.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this work, {{we propose}} a network-based {{approach}} to cluster <b>the</b> protein <b>pockets</b> into similar {{groups in a}} database level. A pocket similarity network is constructed to describe structural similarity relationships among <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> from <b>the</b> systematic perspective, which possesses the community structures and can can be utilized to develop a direct method to cluster <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> by partitioning <b>the</b> network to small communities, which correspond to pocket groups individually. As a first step, we join <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> into structurally similar pocket groups via a hierarchical process guided by maximizing a widely used modularity measurement Q. Then we analyze the functional similarity underlying every divided pocket groups. As a result most of <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> in <b>the</b> same group are identified to share similar functions. These results show that our clustering method is effective and efficient to reveal biologically meaningful pocket groups regard to functional consistence...|$|R
5|$|Having taken Chambois, {{two of the}} Polish battlegroups drove {{north-east}} {{and established}} themselves on part of Hill 262 (Mont Ormel ridge), spending the night of 19 August digging in. The following morning, Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and 9th SS Panzer Division to attack from outside <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> towards the Polish positions. Around midday, several units of the 10th SS Panzer Division, 12th SS Panzer Division and 116th Panzer Division managed {{to break through the}} Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS Panzer Division prevented the Canadians from intervening. By mid-afternoon, about 10,000 German troops had passed out of <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

The Americans began to compress <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery, mortars, and aircraft. A gap, however, existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines, which 2/164 was supposed to have closed.

5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> track.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} diffusion {{processes in}} media with pockets of large diffusivity.

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E
