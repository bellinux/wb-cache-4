The fight for the island culminated in a battle at Chichagof Harbor, where the 7th Infantry Division destroyed all Japanese resistance on the island on May 29, after a suicidal Japanese bayonet charge. The 17th Infantry then invaded Kiska expecting another serious fight, but Brostrom and the others of the regiment found out that the Japanese had evacuated the island prior to the American landing.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is a first attempt to link the geology and mineral {{deposits}} of <b>the</b> Gondwana <b>GIS,</b> called GO-GEOID, to spatial statistics and map modelling. Such integration allows, for example, meaningful identification of the mineral potential of unexplored regions relative to those around them that are known to host major ore deposits. We use gold and tin deposits of Africa to derive prescriptive and predictive potential mineral maps. In the case of the prescriptive output, techniques such as Boolean algebra or multicriteria analysis are explored together with the expert knowledge of the geologist (knowledge-driven models). In the case of the predictive output/models, map layers are combined using a Bayesian probabilistic framework; these models become data-driven and are more objective. Confidence in our predictive model for gold mineralisation is provided through validation against recently discovered gold deposits in Tanzania.
