5000|$|Toyota is {{offering}} a new Continuously Variable Transmission on the LE, LE Eco and S trims, which they claim is more smooth, and improves fuel efficiency, named the CVTi-S (Continuously Variable Transmission intelligent-shift). The diameter ratio between small and large internal pulleys has been increased without increasing the unit's case size achieving a ratio range of 6.3, improving fuel efficiency and acceleration. Its forward gear ratio range is from 0.396 to 2.480 {{and it has a}} 4.761 final drive ratio. A <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> warmer was added, reducing warm-up time, and lower viscosity CVT fluid improves efficiency. Its new <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> reduces parasitic loss at high speeds. The transmission's software creates discrete sequential shift points to emulate traditional transmissions while accelerating. The S trim offers a manual-mode shift gate in the console shifter, or paddle shifters on the steering wheel allowing sequential [...] "shifts" [...] through 7 speeds, addressing complaints that earlier pulley-type CVTs had a [...] "rubber band" [...] feel when accelerating because of the lag as the transmission entered its power band.|$|R
