25|$|While mikoshi-nyūdō {{depicted}} as a yōkai with giant characteristics exists, the mikoshi-nyūdō that {{brings to mind the}} long-necked rokurokubi depicted in play images in the Edo period are certainly not strange. There are those who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> related to the rokurokubi, and since the rokurokubi of legends are frequently female, they are sometimes pointed out as examples of male rokurokubi. The length of its neck has been exaggerated over the passage of eras, and in the late Edo period, it has become standard for its neck to be long and thin, and for its face to have three eyes. In many kusazōshi that had a theme on yōkai, they are also {{depicted as}} having a characteristic long neck, and from having an appearance with such impact, they almost always appear as the chief yōkai.|$|E
500|$|New {{problems}} soon cropped up. Lee Kuan Yew, {{the leader}} of the Singaporean government and the PAP, declared his open opposition to ketuanan Melayu, calling for a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] instead of the implied Malay Malaysia. He argued that [...] "Malays began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago. Of the 39% Malays in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like (Syed Jaafar Albar), who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} {{and head of}} division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> getting {{something out of the}} performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007." ...|$|E

500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at {{the death of his}} wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the script girl, who, as you might imagine, sounded nothing like Bill ," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginzberg {{was born}} into a {{religious}} family whose piety and erudition was well known. The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna. Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. In his book Students, Scholars and Saints, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon instructing, “Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding if you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not in agreement with those of the Talmud.” ...|$|E

2500|$|... "He hateth putting away": This {{is another}} reason against divorce: God hates it. It is {{contrary}} to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see Deuteronomy 24:1, etc.; Matthew 19:3-9). Septuagint, [...] "If thou hate her and dismiss her," [...] etc.; Vulgate, [...] "If thou hate her, put her away," [...] which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} the Mitanni {{aristocracy}} frequently are of Indo-Aryan origin, but it is specifically their deities which show Indo-Aryan roots (Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya), though some <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more immediately related to the Kassites. The common people's language, the Hurrian language, is neither Indo-European nor Semitic. Hurrian is related to Urartian, the language of Urartu, both belonging to the Hurro-Urartian language family. It had been held that nothing more can be deduced from current evidence. A Hurrian passage in the Amarna letters [...] usually composed in Akkadian, the lingua franca of the day [...] indicates that the royal family of Mitanni was by then speaking Hurrian as well.|$|E
