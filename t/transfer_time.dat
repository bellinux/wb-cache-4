40|$|Most {{approaches}} to multi-project scheduling {{are based on}} the assumption that resources can be transferred between projects without any expense in time and cost. As this assumption often is not realistic, we generalise the multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) by additionally including <b>transfer</b> <b>times</b> and cost. To integrate this aspect, in a first step, we develop a framework for considering resource transfers in single and multi-project environments. It includes managerial {{approaches to}} handle resource transfers, a classification of resource transfer types and new roles that resources can take in these transfers. Afterwards, we define the multi-project scheduling problem with <b>transfer</b> <b>times</b> (RCMPSPTT) and formulate it in a basic and an extended version as integer linear programmes. Eventually, it is supplemented for the first time by cost considerations and introduced as resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem with <b>transfer</b> <b>times</b> and cost (RCMPSPTTC). Computational experiments compare the presented managerial approaches and prove the necessity of explicitly considering <b>transfer</b> <b>times</b> in project scheduling. Moreover, the experiments evaluate the presented MIP models and show that specialised solution procedures are vital. project scheduling - combinatorial optimization - mathematical model - <b>transfer</b> <b>times</b> - <b>transfer</b> cost - setup - resource flow...|$|R

25|$|All Metrobuses have SmarTrip card readers which {{automatically}} {{deduct the}} correct fare from a rider's SmarTrip card (including transfer credit). Formerly, Metrobus issued paper transfers {{which gave the}} rider free transfers to any regular bus for two hours.

The routes can be Metrobus routes or routes of other regional operators.

500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data <b>transfer</b> <b>time</b> depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding.|$|E
