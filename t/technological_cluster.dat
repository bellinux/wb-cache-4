With relatively weak IPRs enforcement in China, Chinese firms can imitate and innovate by combining these technological resources to fulfill local consumers’ needs (Luo et al. 2011).

However, very {{little is known about the}} mechanisms of knowledge exchange that take place in clusters. In this paper we draw on the current body of knowledge and use the concepts of tacit and explicit knowledge to understand how knowledge spillovers actually take place. We present a conceptual model of knowledge accessibility as a mean for knowledge transfer, and we distinguish between knowledge transfer and knowledge spillover based on the knowledge holder’s intention or lack of it to exchange such knowledge. We then review how tacit knowledge is being accessed in <b>technological</b> <b>clusters</b> and how it affects knowledge creation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to describe, from a dual perspective, the birth and {{evolution}} of the <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> located in Chihuahua, Mexico. It reconstructs Packard Electric-Delphi's evolutionary path as a dominant company, alongside the technological trajectory of the wiring harness. I build a taxonomy whose purpose is to distinguish different moments in the harness history. This approach to the harness demands systemic distinctions of a dynamic, quantitative and qualitative nature. The formation of the electrical/electronics cluster of automotive parts located in Chihuahua can be understood in the context of Packard Electric's integration/disintegration dynamics. This regional and international reconstruction process reflects: (1) the accumulation of technological and organizational capabilities inside a firm; (2) technological competition within the sector; (3) the fact that each company follows particular technological learning 'paths' as well as a unique regional <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> formation (technological path); and (4) that the integration/disintegration dynamics of firms are difficult and unstable processes, dependent on the difference between internal and external transactional costs.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dynamic {{interactions}} and the spillovers that exist among patent application intensity, secret innovation intensity and stock returns of a well-defined <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> of firms. We study the differential behavior {{when there is}} an Innovation Leader (IL) {{and the rest of the}} firms are Innovation Followers (IFs). The leader and the followers of the <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> are defined according to their patent innovation activity (stock of knowledge). We use data on stock returns and patent applications of a panel of technologically related firms of the United States (US) economy over the period 1979 to 2000. Most firms of the <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> are from the pharmaceutical-products industry. Interaction effects and spillovers are quantified by applying several Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) market value models. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and dynamic interaction multipliers of the PVAR models are estimated. Secret patent innovations are estimated by using a recent Poisson-type patent count data model, which includes a set of dynamic latent variables. We show that firms’ stock returns, observable patent intensities and secret patent intensities have significant dynamic interaction effects for technologically related firms. The predictive absorptive capacity of the IL is the highest and this type of absorptive capacity is positively correlated with good firm performance measures. The innovation spillover effects that exist among firms, due to the imperfect appropriability of the returns of the investment in R&D, are specially important for secret innovations and less relevant for observed innovations. The flow of spillovers between followers and the leader is not symmetric being higher from the IL to the IFs.

This overall goal is accomplished by means of several elements, as follows. Three emerging clusters are referred by the North Region Operation Programme (2007 - 2013 period) as having a very relevant presence in the Norte NUTS II region, in which Grande Porto is contained: ICT, Electronics, and Electrical Machines and Material; Health, Medical Devices and Pharmaceutics; and Biotechnology and Agri-Food.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{draw on the}} {{particular}} experiences of Indian hi-tech immigrants arriving in a growing Canadian <b>technological</b> <b>cluster,</b> the Waterloo Region, located in south-western Ontario. This bilateral pattern of international labour migration between India and Canada reflects both nationsʼ efforts to enhance their economic competitiveness in a global knowledge economy: India as a global exporter and Canada as an importer of knowledge professionals. The stereotypical association of Indian nationals with technology work brings both restrictions and opportunities for Indian hi-tech immigrants navigating a racialised as well as gendered technology labour market in the Waterloo Region. My main aim is to reveal a microcosm of gendered negotiations involving individual economic migrants, their skilled spouses, their employers and the welfare state, particularly {{in the guise of}} officials regulating migration and access to childcare. The complex set of individual behaviours, ideologies, attitudes and practices all contribute to the emergence and maintenance of, as well as challenges to, particular gendered divisions of productive and reproductive work among these new entrants to Canada, as they lose the significant employment, social and familial networks and supports that typically are available in India. These Indian newcomer families view their responsibilities to their family to be as significant as their engagement in the Canadian labour market, as well as the advancement of their individual careers. In practice, however, familial responsibilities remain a more significant aspect of womenʼs lives, reproducing gendered divisions of both paid and unpaid work that mirror traditional gender roles and ideologies. The labour market participation of this particular group of Indian hi-tech immigrants, and especially professional immigrant mothers, is limited by the non-recognition of foreign credentials and cultural and/or racial discrimination but perhaps to an even greater extent by the lack of sufficient provisions for reproductive work under Canadaʼs liberal welfare state.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{theoretical}} model of the learning process with knowledge externalities to R&D and other learning inputs within a region, a technological district, an industry or a <b>technological</b> <b>cluster</b> with fast rates of accumulation of new technological knowledge. As there are several definitions of localized technological and learning opportunities (according to the technical space, or to the regional space) and of localized technological knowledge, we can therefore find several possible applications to the generic model. The analysis of the learning firm interacting with a specific region {{in the production of}} new technological knowledge is just one of them. The analytical model we develop is amenable to a graphical representation. Thus we provide in the first place a unifying graphical framework, consisting of a four-quadrant picture to analyze the process of knowledge accumulation by learning firms located and operating in a specific region or industry, which simultaneously stresses the nature of the basic learning process and the importance of true knowledge spillovers in the generation of new knowledge. We adopt the following approach to the construction of spillover stocks or pools. First, the magnitude of the state of aggregate knowledge in a region or industry is reconstructed through the historic accumulation of flows of knowledge. Thus, the aggregate level of knowledge can always be updated after every learning loop, or at every moment of discrete time, whose unit of measurement we might assume at the outset of our analysis. Secondly, every firm within a region or industry is treated symmetrically regarding spillover effects and magnitudes. Such statement meaning that the amount of aggregate knowledge borrowed from any available source, either the region or industry under analysis or some other distant region or industry, is regarded as the same by every firm. And finally, we model both the loss of appropriation of benefits from innovation and the distance between different technological bases or regional sources in terms of single parameters, or instantaneous rates of growth, weighting respectively the leakage and the absorption intensities of flows and stocks of knowledge. Several theoretical predictions about the direction and magnitude of the knowledge spillovers can therefore be deducted from parametric changes in the leakage and absorption functions of our model arising from, among other things: - Improvements in information technology and falling communication costs observed in the economic system at general. - Improvements in technological communication systems within specific technological districts. - The establishment of explicit cooperative relations and effective access to the pool of collective knowledge, or instead any improvements of the mutuality and trust conditions, within the group of firms located and operating within a specific region. - The increasing of competitive pressures, or the working of any other mechanism for lowering the appropriation of a firm’s gains from innovation, in an array of industrial sectors. One interesting theoretical result is then derived from our full model. With such purpose in mind, we consider first the existence of a relevant competitive situation where appropriation and communication are both dependent upon the number of receiving and sending firms within the region. Whereas the amount of technological leakage per firm increases with the number of firms effectively operating within the region, ceteris paribus; the extent of absorption per firm also increases with the number of firms effectively communicating within the region, ceteris paribus. Apparently, there is a trade-off between such appropriation conditions and communication conditions. In the long-run, the addition of firms eventually exhausts the net positive effects of taking part in an effective network, and so we can establish an equilibrium number of firms operating in the region. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} guidelines for technology policy and promotion a set of "clusters", i. e., inter-related industrial activities, each representing a combination of high technological and economic competitiveness has been elaborated for Austria. Generally speaking, such clusters are not easily identified for Austria. Exceptions are the timber – pulp and paper sector {{as well as the}} manufacturing of railroads and special railroad vehicles. The major reasons are that – some powerful clusters of the past today suffer from secular adjustment problems (e. g., steel, textile); – many successful sectors are part of transnational industries whose core activities and decision centers are located outside Austria (supply of vehicle components, consumer electronics). <b>Technological</b> <b>clusters</b> The assessment of the "density" of economic activities (cluster) is of particular interest if it is related to the performance of the firms involved. This is warranted by the fact that agglomeration effects are often determined by the phenomenon of rising returns to scale. Geographical concentration of production and regional specialization may be indicative of such rising returns to scale. Markets for specific categories of labor, supply of inputs or services of a particular kind, spill-overs of relevant know-how and the existence of adequate infrastructure {{play a major role in}} this context. Using statistical cluster analysis, groups of enterprises have been identified which over the period 1987 - 91 exhibited similar patent registration behavior. These <b>clusters,</b> supplemented by <b>technological</b> and demand side considerations, were regrouped into five categories, all characterized by above-average numbers of patent registrations. – electric/electronic equipment; telecommunication, – transportation, – construction and housing, – skis, skiboots and sports equipment, – chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Within each of these <b>technological</b> <b>clusters</b> there are potential horizontal spill-overs operating between enterprises of similar activity, such as flows of knowledge, common research and training infrastructure, technological division of labor, the pooling of labor resources, etc. Conclusions and consequences The idea of clusters and of activities fitting into a national output structure should – among other factors such as potential value added or sectoral market growth – be a major criterion for the granting of government subsidies or incentives to business location. The advantages of an efficient industrial network are crucial for the establishment of innovative enterprises in dynamic but high-risk market segments and thus for the build-up of new industries. Careful targeting of technology-related subsidies and the establishment of adequate institutions for the diffusion of specific knowledge and skills are thus major elements in a cluster-oriented industrial strategy. Examples are the creation of research and training centers oriented towards future industrial structures or support given for the cooperation between firms and across branches.
