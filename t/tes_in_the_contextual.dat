40|$|Heterochromatin is {{composed}} of transposable elements (TEs) and other repeats and was once {{considered to be a}} wasteland of redundant genetic material and potentially harmful TE. Therefore, the reprogramming of heterochromatin and subsequent reactivation of <b>TE</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immature seed and pollen is paradoxical in plants. Recent studies have shown that reactivation of <b>TE</b> occurs specifically <b>in</b> germline companion cells, the vegetative nucleus (VN) in pollen (Slotkin et al. 2009) and <b>the</b> endosperm <b>in</b> seed (Gehring et al. 2009). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ovule, ARGONAUTE 9 (AGO 9) not only has a role <b>in</b> silencing <b>TE</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> egg cell but also <b>in</b> preventing <b>the</b> formation of multiple asexual gametophytes (Olmedo-Monfil et al. 2010). We propose that reprogramming of heterochromatin in germline companion cells reveals <b>TE</b> <b>in</b> a controlled manner to expose them within the germline and, by the production of small interfering RNA (siRNA), ensures <b>TE</b> silencing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next generation.
