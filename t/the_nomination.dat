As instructed, Cameron placed <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> for Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman. <b>The</b> <b>nomination</b> was passed unanimously. Later, delegates John H.

Senator Eugene Hale of Maine submitted a resolution for a roll call, in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the people from their delegation serving on the convention's three committees. The committees were formed, and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Kennedy was {{substantially}} behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Historian Michael Beschloss believed, however, that Kennedy would not have secured <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4% to 42.7%. Nixon won by a more decisive 301-191 margin in the electoral vote.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for <b>the</b> <b>nomination,</b> but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Kentucky's delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson {{was not going to}} be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E

5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} as {{the first}} runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died {{a few months after}} the election he was passed over several times for <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> This was controversial as <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> is customarily given to the runner-up in the most recent election. He returned to elective politics to defeat the mayor, who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led to repeated, fruitless {{attempts}} by the president to fill the vacancy.

Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. <b>The</b> <b>nomination</b> of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality his chances of winning <b>the</b> <b>nomination</b> were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan <b>the</b> <b>nomination.</b> Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E
