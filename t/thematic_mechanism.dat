Since then, different causes began to be developed in various international legal bodies, whose sentences served to establish a specific jurisprudence on enforced disappearance.|$|R
5000|$|The use of wa to {{introduce}} a new theme of discourse is directly linked {{to the notion of}} grammatical theme. Opinions differ on the structure of discourse theme, though it seems fairly uncontroversial to imagine a first-in-first-out hierarchy of themes that is threaded through the discourse. Of course, human limitations restrict the scope and depth of themes, and later themes may cause earlier themes to expire. In these sorts of sentences, the steadfast translation into English uses constructs like [...] "speaking of X" [...] or [...] "on the topic of X", though such translations tend to be bulky as they fail to use the <b>thematic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of English. For lack of a comprehensive strategy, many teachers of Japanese emphasize the [...] "speaking of X" [...] pattern without sufficient warning.|$|R
40|$|The main {{research}} question of this thesis was to test if native-like ERP patterns {{in response to}} specific processing difficulties would emerge in postpubescent L 2 learners at a stage of very high proficiency. In most precious ERP studies on L 2 processing ERP components related to syntactic processes {{were found to be}} different in L 2 as compared to L 1, suggesting maturational constraints on the development of syntactic functions. Recently, ERP studies in the domain of L 2 and artificial grammar processing suggested that high proficiency might be a more important prerequisite for the development of native-like ERP patterns in the course of second language learning than age of acquisition (AoA). The studies of this thesis were aimed to bridge the field of natural language and artificial grammar studies using a miniature language paradigm. Language processing mechanisms were studied in the model of a miniature language termed Mini-Nihongo, which was a subset of real Japanese. The use of a very downscaled language was hypothesized to enable the development of native-like ERP paterns in initially naive adult German participants. Syntactic and <b>thematic</b> processing <b>mechanisms</b> were targeted by means of a violation paradigm. Mini-Nihongo was constructed to create word category potentially difficult to acquire...|$|R

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{storytelling}} {{in the state of}} moderate stress. The theoretical part includes an introduction to the issue of stress, defense <b>mechanisms,</b> <b>Thematic</b> Apperception Test and then explains in detail theory of defense mechanism according to Phebe Cramer and also Defense Mechanism Manual which is used for evaluation of TAT defenses. The aim of empirical part of this thesis is to find out whether moderate pain which is caused by the fact that participants holds their hand in front of them (in position of "staying power") has effect on number of occurrence of defense mechanisms in narratives according to TAT. The stories are narrated during the staying power position. The second aim is to verify whether number and quality of used defenses has effect on the duration of the staying power position. The simple regression analysis was used to find out that there is no significant relationship between number of used defense mechanisms and the level of experienced pain. However, it is shown that higher usage of defense mechanisms has positive effect on duration of staying power position. This effect is even stronger if only matured defense mechanisms are included in the model, which is projection and identification...|$|R

40|$|A partir dos anos 90, a participa??o dos diversos setores sociais se tornou uma importante estrat?gia dos governos na formula??o e implementa??o de pol?ticas p?blicas. O governo brasileiro, somente no ano de 2003, instituiu a Confer?ncia Nacional de Meio Ambiente e suas etapas estaduais como instrumento de ampla participa??o da sociedade. Para que este f?rum se constitua legitimamente enquanto arena p?blica de delibera??es, uma condi??o indispens?vel ? que seja capaz de atrair a participa??o dos diversos setores da sociedade. Ainda que estrat?gias e padr?es formulados nacionalmente sejam adotados, a efetiva participa??o social estar? sujeita aos contextos locais. Assim sendo, torna-se {{relevante}} avaliar na pr?tica como os processos gerais de mobiliza??o desencadeados pelas confer?ncias nacionais de meio ambiente produziram os seus reflexos no contexto do estado do Amazonas, em particular. Al?m disso, cabe questionar se esse processo de consulta p?blica ampliada vem sendo capaz de influenciar a formula??o e implementa??o de pol?ticas p?blicas de fato. A evolu??o da composi??o e representatividade social das plen?rias e delega??es das confer?ncias estaduais de meio ambiente (CEMA) e o grau de implementa??o de suas delibera??es foram analisadas com base na investiga??o de todas as edi??es j? realizadas no Amazonas. Os dados foram obtidos mediante o levantamento dos documentos governamentais, entrevistas com representantes da comiss?o organizadora estadual e delegados e a avalia??o participativa feita com gestores p?blicos dos ?rg?os governamentais chaves. Enquanto a trajet?ria das confer?ncias de meio ambiente no Amazonas aponta para um equil?brio na representatividade social de g?neros, a representatividade de gera??es ainda parece muito distante do ideal. A representatividade geopol?tica das plen?rias e das delega??es ? marcada pelo predom?nio de representantes da capital do estado e a baixa participa??o do setor empresarial/patronal vem comprometendo a representatividade social das confer?ncias. A Confer?ncia Estadual de Meio Ambiente, por n?o ter sido at? ent?o formalizada legalmente como uma inst?ncia deliberativa do SISNAMA, suas delibera??es n?o se tornam obrigat?rias, o que deixa a crit?rio do governo consider?-las ou n?o como um instrumento norteador da pol?tica ambiental. Tomando-se como refer?ncia o grau de implementa??o das 156 delibera??es da II CEMA, constatou-se que dentre dezesseis ?rg?os governamentais chave, as secretarias de Meio Ambiente e de Produ??o foram respons?veis pela maior parte das a??es e programas que resultaram na implementa??o de 77 % das delibera??es aprovadas. Apesar de ultimamente o estado ter criado diversos conselhos tem?ticos especializados, tais conselhos n?o deveriam substituir a Confer?ncia Estadual, pois, muito mais do que aqueles, as confer?ncias s?o espa?os p?blicos capazes de mobilizar mais amplamente a sociedade. Since the 90 ?s, {{the participation}} of various social sectors has become an important strategy of governments in the formulation and implementation of public policies. The Brazilian government, only in 2003, established the National Conference on Environment and its state-level stages {{as a tool for}} a wider social participation. For this board to be constituted as a legitimate arena of public deliberation, a prerequisite is that they are able to attract the involvement of various sectors of society. Although formulated strategies and standards are adopted nationally, the effective social participation will be subjected to local contexts. Thus, it becomes relevant to assess in practice how the general processes of mobilization triggered by national conferences of the environment produced their reflections {{in the context of the}} state of Amazonas, in particular. In addition, one must question whether this process of public consultation has been extended to influence the formulation and implementation of public policies in effect. The evolution of the composition and social representativeness of plenary and delegation of the state conference of environment (CEMA) and the degree of implementation of its resolutions were analyzed based on the investigation of all previous editions in the Amazon. Data were collected through a survey of government documents, interviews with representatives of the organizing committee and delegates and a participatory assessment made with public managers of key government agencies. While the trajectory of environmental conferences in the Amazon points to a social balance in gender representation, the representation of generations still seems far from ideal. The geopolitics of plenary representation and delegations is marked by the predominance of representatives from the state capital and the low participation of the private sector / employer is committing the social representativeness of the conference. The State Conference on the Environment, by not having hitherto been legally formalized as a deliberative body SISNAMA, its decisions do not become binding, which leaves to the discretion of the government to consider them as a guiding instrument of environmental policy. Taking as reference the level of implementation of 156 resolutions of II CEMA, it was found that among sixteen key government agencies, the secretaries of Environment and of Production accounted for most of the actions and programs that resulted in the implementation of 77 % the resolutions adopted. Although lately the state has created several specialized <b>thematic</b> councils, such <b>mechanism</b> should not replace the State Conference, therefore, much more than those, conferences are public spaces that can mobilize society more broadly...|$|R
