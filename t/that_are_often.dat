5|$|Beyond {{the letters}} themselves, {{there are a}} variety of {{secondary}} symbols which aid in transcription. Diacritic marks can be combined with IPA letters to transcribe modified phonetic values or secondary articulations.

5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies.

5|$|Simple one-move or two-move {{tactical}} actions – threats, {{exchanges of}} material, and double attacks– {{can be combined}} into more complicated combinations, sequences of tactical maneuvers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> forced {{from the point of}} view of one or both players. Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} ancient Greek {{references}} to sheep: that of Chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing {{to be told}} through into the modern era. Astrologically, Aries, the ram, is {{the first sign of}} the classical Greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the Chinese zodiac, related to the Chinese calendar. In Mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> used for fortunetelling purposes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalogue, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right symbols <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalogue listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed in the catalogue of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E

5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> very {{closely tied to the}} land, flora and culture of the particular writer, {{especially in the case of}} Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.|$|E
