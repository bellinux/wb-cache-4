500|$|In 2011, Kashyap {{directed}} That Girl in Yellow Boots, {{a thriller}} starring Kalki Koechlin who also co-wrote the film with him. The film was screened at many festivals including 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, 67th Venice International Film Festival, Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles and the London Indian Film Festival. Shot in thirteen days, {{the film was}} released on September 2011. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the character-driven film and the portrayal of its lead alongside the city compared to most Hindi films: [...] " [...] a film like this provides a radically different view of India <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find in the pleasures and excesses of Bollywood".|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, were also positive, commenting that the episode is [...] "one of the fastest paced episodes ever", and [...] "moves at breathless speed". They added that it is [...] "enormous fun with more bizarre moments <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> shake a stick at", {{particularly}} praising a scene involving [...] "a hysterical Joan Rivers". Mac MacEntire of DVD Verdict wrote that the establishing shots in Vegas were the episode's highlights. Aaron Roxby of Collider thought negatively of the episode however, writing that, even though the episode has [...] "some decent gags", it is overall [...] "one of the weaker Flanders based episodes".|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it any more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> unlearn to think." ...|$|E

500|$|Hobart was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining {{a major part of the}} Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan's surge. [...] In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, [...] "An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor." [...] McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart, and considered modifying some of Hobart's expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution. [...] Hobart insisted on it being printed without change, writing, [...] "I think I know the sentiment of Eastern men better <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as I have written them." [...] According to Connolly, [...] "Though a protectionist, Hobart believed the money issue, not tariffs, led to a November Republican victory, and, in denouncing silver, his rhetoric far outstripped [...] William McKinley." ...|$|E
500|$|By lap 39, Alonso {{had reduced}} the time deficit {{between himself and}} Massa as the latter was lapping the two Virgin cars. At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over the radio {{to increase the gap}} to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, and was told that braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the inside of his car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is faster <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "highlight" [...] for Lynch was {{the scene}} where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were {{watching}} Twilight together, {{not only because the}} [...] "friendship between Kurt and Mercedes" [...] has been [...] "sadly downplayed", but because it was [...] "nice to see the Glee kids just being kids sometimes". The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as [...] "one of the truest moments of the season so far". Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something we care more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E

500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, {{those close}} to Ravel {{recognised}} {{that he had lost}} much of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, [...] "Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised". His output, never large, became smaller. Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era. Fauré wrote to him, [...] "I am happier <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor." [...] Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and though he declined the decoration he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure. Satie had turned against him, and commented, [...] "Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it." [...] Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development. Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks. He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style. [...] Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries. The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1958 Comecon {{had begun}} to push for what was later termed an [...] "international socialist {{division}} of labor," [...] in which Albania was relegated to [...] "the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials." [...] In May 1959 Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania's leadership into building up Yugoslav–Albanian and Soviet–Albanian ties and also to, in the words of historian Miranda Vickers, [...] "focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry... Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled." [...] According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in Butrint and said to Rodion Malinovsky, the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, [...] "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [...] should be dug up and thrown into the sea... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything." [...] He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country [...] "into a flourishing garden," [...] suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export. Khrushchev allegedly said, [...] "The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> produce here." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

The rest of the surplus was spent on school consolidation as one room schoolhouses were phased out and students bused to larger centralized facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Variety's Justin Chang {{called the}} film an [...] "exercise in sensory overkill" [...] {{and said that}} Bay took on [...] "the weighty moral conundrums of human cloning, resolving them in a storm of bullets, car chases and more explosions <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> shake a syringe at." [...] He noted McGregor and Buscemi as {{highlights}} of the film, along with Nigel Phelps' production design.
