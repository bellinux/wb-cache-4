5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training {{hard for the}} World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E
5|$|As a pinch hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} to pinch hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E
5|$|On August 11 at AT Park, Bumgarner {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game 3–1 {{victory over the}} Houston Astros where he struck out twelve and walked none. During the outing, he struck out a career-high seven straight batters <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> San Francisco record with Juan Marichal and Jonathan Sánchez. On August 16, he tied his career-high by striking out fourteen batters, including striking out that year's National League MVP Bryce Harper a career-high three times, hit a home run, and pitched a complete game shutout against the Washington Nationals. He became the first Giants left-handed pitcher to record multiple fourteen-strikeout games in a single season and career, and joined Juan Marichal as the only Giants pitchers in the San Francisco Era to strike out ten or more batters, hit a home run, and record a shutout in the same game. Bumgarner was honored {{for the first time}} in his career with National League Player of the Week honors.|$|E

They find the city under dictatorial rule by 'Madame La Presidente' Grasiento, and learn that the town contains no Condor Transglobal offices. The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, {{and that he has}} not been in Paris recently. George decides to help a CIA agent, Duane, free a local agitator, Miguel, from jail by distracting General Grasiento. Afterwards, he prepares to detonate the jail wall but is arrested in the process. George gets Duane <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> rope to the bars and pull the wall down with his truck, alerting General Grasiento. Miguel escapes, and Nico and George flee down river on a boat. However, the boat sinks after being attacked by a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{presence}} of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is common for kickers to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) <b>to</b> <b>tie.</b> <b>A</b> kicker is a card {{which is part of the}} five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's rank.

In their first match, Australia lost to Bangladesh by five wickets in the last over, perhaps the biggest upset in recent memory. Just before that game Andrew Symonds was dropped for disciplinary reasons. The following day, Australia lost their second match in a row to England, due mainly to Kevin Pietersen's late batting onslaught. However, Australia remained undefeated {{throughout the rest of the}} series <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> thrilling final against England at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{defeated}} the Dodgers, four games to three, {{to win their}} first World Series in franchise history, and the first team from Texas to do so. Both teams set a World Series record with a combined total of 25 home runs throughout the entire series, including a team record 15 home runs by the Astros, and hit a combined total of eight home runs in Game 2 to set the single game World Series mark. Houston outfielder George Springer was named as the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after hitting five home runs in the series <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> World Series record with Reggie Jackson in 1977 and Dodgers' 2017 World Series representative Chase Utley in 2009 when he played for the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
25|$|Weapons {{are linked}} to several superstitions and {{cultural}} beliefs in South Asia. Drawing a weapon without reason is forbidden and considered by Hindus to be disrespectful to the goddess Chandika. Thus the saying that a sword cannot be sheathed until it has drawn blood. It was a mother's duty <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> warrior's sword around his waist before war or a duel. In addition, she would cut her finger with the sword and make a tilak on his head from a drop of her blood. Weapons themselves were also anointed with tilak, most often from the blood of a freshly-decapitated goat (chatanga). Other taboos include looking at one's reflection in the blade, telling the price or source of acquisition, throwing {{it on the ground}} or using it for domestic purposes.|$|E

25|$|Various {{symbolic}} and religious qualities {{are attributed to}} Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to shaatnez and keeps one warm without using wool, and Sabbath shoes are laceless {{in order not to}} have <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> knot, a prohibited action. A gartel divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidim customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredim today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and Samet (velvet) or biber (beaver) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidim.|$|E
25|$|Nebraska scored nine {{runs in the}} first, 10 in the second, four in the third, nine in the fourth, 13 in {{the fifth}} and five in the sixth, as the game was called {{in the seventh inning}} because of the 12-run rule. Eight Huskers belted nine home runs in the game. Ken Harvey hit two homers, and Scott Larsen, Adam Stern and Brian Kent hit their first career home runs. Besides setting school team records for runs (50), RBIs (48) and hits (35), Harvey, Jim Bailey and Craig Moore each {{established}} or tied individual school records. Harvey and Bailey each scored seven runs in the game, while Moore became the third player in school history to drive in 10 runs in a game. Bailey, who only had two official at bats, walked five times <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> 50-year-old school record. Tom Novak held the previous mark of five set against Denver College on April 18, 1949. In the game, Nebraska scored the first 23 runs before the Cougars had a base runner, as Husker pitchers retired the first nine Cougar hitters. Eleven Huskers had at least two hits and seven had at least three hits.|$|E
25|$|In {{his third}} NBA campaign, the Celtics began {{the season with}} the best {{starting}} record in NBA history and also set a franchise record with a nineteen-game winning streak. Rondo's numbers increased from his previous season performance; however, he was criticized for his shooting. He recorded his first career triple-double along with a career-high in assists (16 points, 13 rebounds and 17 assists), against the Indiana Pacers. In a home win against the New York Knicks, Rondo led the team <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>a</b> franchise record with eighteen straight wins. However, after the winning streak was snapped the team struggled, losing seven out of nine games after ending the streak. Rondo—matched {{up with one of}} the league's quicker guards, Tony Parker—recorded 16 assists in a losing effort against the Spurs, one short of his season-high. Less than a week later against the Mavericks, he recorded his second career triple-double (19 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists), and then recorded a career-high 32 points against the Phoenix Suns on his 23rd birthday. He became the first NBA athlete to sign an endorsement contract with Red Bull on April 17, 2009. He finished the season ranking fifth in the NBA in assists (8.2) and steals (1.9). The team finished the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, although they entered the playoffs without their injured All-Star power forward Kevin Garnett.|$|E
