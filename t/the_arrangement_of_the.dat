5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. <b>The</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential {{problem is that the}} increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E

The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use {{the symbol of the}} cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The O-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1937 {{to supplement the}} s then planned for the new German fleet.

5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all {{in an effort to}} show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E

5|$|A shorter {{period of}} {{dockyard}} work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She {{returned to the}} fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after {{the conclusion of the}} autumn maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910. During the refit, four of the ship's 15cm guns and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were removed. Two 8.8cm guns were added and <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 8.8cm battery was modified. Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and the ship's funnels were lengthened. After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there {{for the rest of her}} peacetime career.|$|E
5|$|For the concert, Jonne Valtonen {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arranger; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005, including Symphonic Shades. He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline {{given to him by}} BÃ¶cker. Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements, during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer's original intended expression. No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material, but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music from the Chrono games. This was Wanamo's first time arranging video game music. On March 9, 2009 It was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played {{at the start of the}} concert, and with a video preview of his composition was released.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plates {{on the back}} may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates {{of the same size}} and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E
