To gain <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes.

Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary.

She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction.

The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed these murders with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.

He then sailed to Lesbos, where, with <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces {{on the island and}} won over a number of cities.

5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
