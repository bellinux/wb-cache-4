5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected {{to play for the}} Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was taught}} Indian Sign Language by the Crow. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great help {{to him in}} his {{research}} as the language was common to all the plains tribes. Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in the battle with Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} {{reviewed}} by the Commission of Fine Arts, and in an April 29, 1976, letter, Commission member J. Carter Brown praised the design: I believe <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> superb design for United States Coinage, rooted {{as it is in}} a great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, following Augustin Dupré's Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga and Yorktown (1777–1781).|$|E
5|$|A {{spacecraft}} crashes at Wiekamp Air Force base in West Virginia, and {{the surviving}} Rebel passenger is {{captured by the}} military. Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suicidal course of action.|$|E
40|$|Nihilism is not escaped by decree. Its {{subjective}} frameworks {{remain with}} us. To those educators who remain wedded, despite everything, {{to the idea}} of mastery – and this represents most of us – it is worth considering how an exit might look, one that operates through, rather than in spite of, the promise of mastery. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exercise in Sade’s Reason, as Maurice Blanchot <b>would</b> have it. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attempt to practice mastery without enslavement, passing through enslavement to its opposite. So let us imagine education as mastery, as its fulfilment, and see how that might look...|$|R

5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
50|$|Dominic Raab {{called for}} the National Minimum Wage to be {{scrapped}} for 16- to 21-year-olds in order to boost youth employment, though doubts were raised {{as to whether or}} not <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective measure.|$|R
50|$|Parsons likely {{could have}} had his {{sentence}} commuted {{to life in prison}} rather than death, but he refused to write the letter asking the governor to do so, as <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> admission of guilt.|$|R

5|$|The Expédition d'Irlande ("Expedition to Ireland") was an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by the}} First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars to assist the outlawed Society of United Irishmen, a popular rebel Irish republican group, in their planned rebellion against British rule. The French intended to land a large expeditionary force in Ireland {{during the winter of}} 1796–1797 which would join with the United Irishmen and drive the British out of Ireland. The French anticipated that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major blow to British morale, prestige and military effectiveness, and was also intended to possibly be the first stage of an eventual invasion of Britain itself. To this end, the French Directory gathered a force of approximately 15,000 soldiers at Brest under General Lazare Hoche during late 1796, in readiness for a major landing at Bantry Bay in December.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E
40|$|In this exercise, {{students}} observe {{simulations of}} melting sea ice and a melting {{continental ice sheet}} in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} melting of the ice and the water level in the tank. The water tanks simulate the world oceans. In the first example, the ice is floating in water. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> example of icebergs or Arctic ice floating on the ocean. In the second example the ice lies on a wood structure. The structure simulates a continent. The block of ice on top of the structure simulates ice grounded on top of <b>a</b> continent. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> example of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{turning point}} of the game, as the Giants, who had trouble {{mounting}} many drives to that point, {{came back with a}} 95–yard drive. The key play of the drive was Conerly's pass to Kyle Rote, who after a 62–yard gain, fumbled at the Colts' 25–yard line, where Alex Webster picked up the ball and ran it to the 1–yard line. New York then scored a touchdown, to make the score 14–10. The Giants drove again, with quarterback Charley Conerly throwing a 15–yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 2-way design.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E
