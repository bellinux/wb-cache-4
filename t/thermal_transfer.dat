5|$|VV Corvi {{is a close}} spectroscopic binary, its two {{component}} stars orbiting {{each other}} with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars are very close to each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.|$|E
5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E

In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for joining two metallic components by <b>thermal</b> energy <b>transfer</b> for forming a welding area connecting both components {{in the form of}} a welding seam and/or a welding point (2), comprises carrying out a plastic deformation through a process or combination of processes such as shot blasting, hammering, rolling, laser shocking treatment, mechanical surface processing with or without local material removal such as grinding, milling or edging, where one of the components exists before the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>transfer</b> in a component area adjacent itself directly on the welding area forming itself in the way of <b>thermal</b> energy <b>transfer.</b> The plastic deformation is carried out in the component area that finds out an area detected by <b>thermal</b> energy <b>transfer,</b> where the area corresponds to heat influence area within which the metallic material of the component finds out a metallographically viewable impact of structural condition. The plastic deformation is carried out in such a way that the skips form itself in the metallic microstructure within the metallic material of the component, and number and/or the characteristics of crystallographic skips from the surface of the component with component depth.
