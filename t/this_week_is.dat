5|$|<b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>is</b> {{a current}} affairs {{television}} series {{which began in}} 1956. In 1978, it was renamed TV Eye and took on a slightly lighter format; the title This Week was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the ITV regions and became a mainstay of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including Margaret Thatcher (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.|$|E

500|$|On January 23, 2009, Tom Poleman, {{senior vice}} {{president}} of programming for Clear Channel Radio, announced they planned to play an edited version. Sharon Dastur of Z100 added that Spears had recorded {{a new version of the}} song and the new edit would be provided by Jive Records. David Hinckley of the Daily News commented that [...] "Clear Channel, which laid off 9% of its workforce <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>is</b> hardly in the mood to finance an FCC fight right now". Finally, a radio edit titled [...] "If U See Amy" [...] was released to American radio stations (after some stations briefly eliminated those lyrics of the song entirely), which changes the [...] "seek" [...] to [...] "see". The amended version was released in the UK in May. While the song has not officially been renamed or released in Australia, some radio stations, such as those belonging to the Austereo Radio Network, play the censored version, while others continue to play the uncensored. Both the music video and the international radio single remain [...] "If U Seek Amy".|$|E

In the early 1950s, it accompanied 37 Sunday newspapers. A decade later, at its peak in 1963, <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>was</b> distributed with the Sunday editions of 42 newspapers for a total circulation of 14.6 million.|$|R
500|$|Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel {{said that}} [...] "the hottest {{attraction}} in Central Florida theme parks <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>is</b> also the coldest." [...] Bevil interviewed several park guests; comments included [...] "I thought it [...] was really cool" [...] and [...] "it's beautiful", and some {{described it as}} better than the attractions it replaced. Barbara Nefer of Examiner.com said that guests would love Puck, the ride's central character. She preferred the wild version of the ride, describing it as [...] "actually still very family friendly" [...] and saying that the exhibit was a [...] "huge highlight" [...] of the attraction. Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider agreed that {{the highlight of the}} attraction was the penguin exhibit. Niles described the dispatch procedure as crucial to the ride: [...] "if SeaWorld can dispatch a quartet of ride vehicles every minute or so, as designed, fans will find this a fun ride". In a later article Niles highlighted some guests' criticisms of the ride, describing it as [...] "lacking an engaging story and not delivering enough on-ride views of the attraction's stars -- SeaWorld's penguins". However, he argues that SeaWorld's promotions were too photorealistic creating [...] "expectations for an experience that the ride did not deliver, perhaps setting up many of those visitors for disappointment".|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>Is</b> it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

While range personnel wear campaign covers similar to drill instructors, PMIs are not drill instructors and generally not as strict in enforcing discipline upon recruits, focusing on marksmanship and expecting recruits to uphold their own discipline.|$|E

I saw him lounging about on the beach, idling away his time, yesterday; pity he wasn't at some decent trade, instead of hanging about and doing nothing, {{as if he was}} a gentleman. Five pounds of lump sugar, too; good lump sugar, though I expect I shall get nothing but beetroot; it's all beetroot now, my brother tells me; they've ruined the West Indies with their emancipation fads and their differential duties and the Lord knows what--we had estates in the West Indies ourselves, all given up to our negroes nowadays--and now I believe they have to pay the French a bounty or something of the sort to induce them to make sugar out of beetroot, because the negroes won't work without whipping, so I understand; that's what comes in the end of your Radical fal-lal notions. Well, five pounds of lump, and five pounds of moist, though the one's as bad as the other, really. A great pity about your son. I hope he'll get a place again soon. It must be a trial to you to have him so idle!' ...|$|E
