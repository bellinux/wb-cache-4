25|$|The most {{successful}} ribavirin derivative {{to date is}} the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J.T.Witkowski et al., and now called <b>taribavirin</b> (former names viramidine and ribamidine). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to ribavirin, which is not surprising {{as it is now}} known to be a pro-drug for ribavirin. Viramidine, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to viramidine's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide, in liver tissue. Viramidine is in phase III human trials and may one day be used in place of ribavirin, at least against certain kinds of viral hepatitis. Viramidine's slightly superior toxicological properties may eventually cause it to replace ribavirin in all uses of ribavirin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taribavirin</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1973 by J.T.Witkowski et al., then working at ICN Pharmaceuticals, {{in an attempt}} to find a more active derivative of ribavirin. <b>Taribavirin</b> is being developed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Valeant is testing the drug as a treatment for chronic hepatitis C.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taribavirin</b> is {{as active}} against {{influenza}} as ribavirin in animal models, with slightly less toxicity, {{so it may}} also eventually replace ribavirin as an anti-influenza agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taribavirin</b> (rINN; {{also known}} as viramidine, codenamed ICN 3142) is an {{antiviral}} drug in Phase III human trials, but not yet approved for pharmaceutical use. It is a prodrug of ribavirin, active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. <b>Taribavirin</b> has better liver-targeting than ribavirin, and has a shorter life in the body due to less penetration and storage in red blood cells. It is expected eventually to be the drug of choice for viral hepatitis syndromes in which ribavirin is active. These include hepatitis C and perhaps also hepatitis B and yellow fever.|$|E
5000|$|During Waksal's {{leadership}} of ImClone {{the company was}} engaged in early stage research projects for 15 years before filing its first drug application. [...] Kadmon however immediately began acquiring drugs further advanced - either already marketed in the US or in the later stages of clinical development. [...] It acquired the Warrendale, PA-based company Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals and their Ribasphere and topotecan products. It also {{signed an agreement with}} Ontario, Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals for their Hepatitis C drugs ribavirin and <b>taribavirin</b> (now KD024). Cancer drugs XL647 and XL844 were acquired from Exelixis. An inhibitor of several protein kinases, XL647 (KD019) entered Phase II clinical trial for certain indications of non-small cell lung cancer. and in polycystic kidney disease. [...] XL844 is an inhibitor of protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation therapy.|$|E
