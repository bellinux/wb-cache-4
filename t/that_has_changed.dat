25|$|Skin cancers are cancers {{that arise}} from the skin. They are due to the {{development}} of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.|$|E
