5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection {{and the fact that}} I had a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun but I had never fired it.

5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through his glasses which had been found at the murder scene. Tests done on <b>the</b> <b>glasses,</b> which were {{eventually}} traced back to McDowell, revealed that the lenses were of a prescription worn by just 1 in 500,000 of the population.|$|E
5|$|Sam and {{his high}} school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who {{turns out to be}} Autobot scout Bumblebee, but he is mute and has to {{communicate}} through his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>glasses,</b> but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, while Optimus obtains <b>the</b> <b>glasses,</b> and uses them to locate the Allspark.|$|E

50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> {{substrate}} is cleaned using detergents and ultrasonic baths, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> {{is placed}} in a spin coater. The spin coater rinses <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> blank with a solvent and then applies either photoresist or dye-polymer depending on the mastering process.

50|$|Toughened glass must be {{cut to size}} or {{pressed to}} shape before toughening, and cannot be re-worked once toughened.

5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. <b>The</b> <b>glasses</b> {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{investigate}} how glass filtered UV irradiances vary with glass thickness, lamination of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> and <b>the</b> effect of SZA, and to measure <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> filtered UV exposures to different receiving planes with a newly developed UVA dosimeter. Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> filtered solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> thickness and <b>the</b> solar zenith angle (SZA). <b>The</b> laminated <b>glass</b> transmitted 11 to 12 % and <b>the</b> windscreen <b>glass</b> transmitted 2. 5 to 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for <b>the</b> thicker <b>glass</b> {{than it was for}} <b>the</b> thinner <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was negligible influence due to the SZA on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transmitted UV of the laminated and windscreen <b>glass.</b> <b>The</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> thickness in <b>the</b> range of 2 mm to 6 mm on the percentage transmission was less than 16 %. The influences of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> thickness and <b>the</b> SZA on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transmitted UV have been incorporated in the use of a UVA dosimeter for <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transmitted UV exposures.

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing <b>the</b> <b>glasses.</b> During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E

25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of <b>the</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Seneca <b>Glass</b> Company used European glass {{production}} methods {{learned by}} their founders in Germany. [...] <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> was lead flint glass, {{which is made}} mostly from silica, potash, and oxide of lead. This type of glass has more sparkle and shine than flint glass made from lime. [...] Using technology from the 1890s and earlier, the glassblower’s assistant (the gatherer) used a hollow pipe to extract molten glass from a pot. [...] A pot was about 40 inches in diameter, and Seneca’s pots held 2000 lbs kg of batch. [...] <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> blower and his crew used air, hand tools, and molds to shape <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> into <b>the</b> desired form. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> appears orange, and then yellow, while it is still being shaped. In some cases, a glazer was used to smooth edges of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> with small jets of flame. [...] Once <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> had <b>the</b> correct shape, it was then placed in a lehr, which is a long oven used for annealing, a process where <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> is gradually cooled. Without annealing, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> would easily shatter. In {{the case of the}} glassware made at Seneca's Morgantown plant, it took almost 2 hours for <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> to move through the lehr.
