5|$|Considered {{to be one}} of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> {{examples}} of medieval Bulgarian architecture, the Round Church takes its name from the distinctive shape of one of its three sections, the cella (naos), which is a rotunda that serves as a place of liturgy. The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or narthex, marked by two circular turrets.|$|E
5|$|This {{spectacular}} moth {{is considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> and beautiful Lepidoptera, rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most coffee table books on the Lepidoptera, and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make jewellery in the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script {{was about to be}} filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E

5|$|By {{this period}} Scotland had been {{penetrated}} by the wider La Tène culture, which {{is named after}} the archaeological site of La Tène {{on the north side}} of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland.

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|Muslim women, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} Ayyubid family, the families of local governors, and {{the families of the}} ulema ("religious scholars") took an active role in Ayyubid architecture. Damascus witnessed the most sustained patronage of religious architecture by women. They were responsible for the construction of 15 madrasas, six Sufi hospices, and 26 religious and charitable institutions. In Aleppo, the Firdaws Madrasa, known as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Ayyubid building in Syria, had regent queen Dayfa Khatun as its patron.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 2006, the Tour de France {{announced}} that Basso would not ride the 2006 Tour after apparent {{involvement in the}} Operación Puerto doping scandal. Sastre took over as captain and was the strongest in the favorite group on the last mountain stages, but a poor last time trial placed him fourth overall.

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> single-game {{performances}} by any player in NHL history came on April 27, 1994. Hašek made 70 saves in a 4OT shutout. The opposing goalie was Martin Brodeur, then a rookie, who made 49 saves before being beaten by Dave Hannan and the Sabres beat New Jersey 1–0, which helped the Sabres {{to tie the}} series 3-3 {{in the first round}} of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Hašek's 70 saves set a record, which still stands, for the most saves in a game without allowing a goal.|$|E
5|$|The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> masque thrown {{at any of the}} Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy of Errors was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night of Errors and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E
5|$|The Newstead Helmet, {{found at}} the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> of many finds of Roman arms and armour.

5|$|The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, {{designed}} by Elias David Häusser and {{completed in the}} 1740s, was certainly one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Baroque buildings of its day. Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794, the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today. Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence {{on the shore of}} Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle. The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{was born}} in Churwell, a village close to Morley, on 12 February 1857. He {{was the son of}} a miner, and Peel himself worked in the mines for a time. From the age of 16, he played with {{increasing}} frequency for the Churwell cricket team, and by 1882 was part of the Yorkshire Colts. At the time, Edmund Peate was the first-choice left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, and his presence restricted Peel's opportunities. An injury to Peate allowed Peel to make his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Surrey at Sheffield on 10 July 1882. Peel took nine wickets in the game, including five for 83 (five wickets taken while conceding 83 runs) in the second innings. Lord Hawke—who assumed the captaincy of Yorkshire later that season—subsequently described Peel's debut as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> for Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring {{training}} in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher.

Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E
