The role played by CYP 3 A was also studied in Rifampicin (RIF) induced rabbits. Material and methods Liver microsomes were obtained (2) from rabbits. five male (3 ± 0. 4 kg), five female (3 ± 0. 2 kg), five young male (1, 5 ± 0, 3 kg), and two male induced with RIF (50 mg/kg, 4 days, ip). Microsomes (0. 2 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 min, at 37 °C with 250 µM T. Hydroxylated metabolites were extracted with methylene chloride and separated according to Purdon (3) with HPLC using a C 18 column and <b>ternary</b> phase <b>gradient</b> elution. Elution times were compared with those of pure standards (Steraloids). Discussion Main differences are: the absence in males of 16 alfa-OHT; the greater production (*P< 0, 001) of 6 beta-OHT, 11 alfa-OHT, 16 beta-OHT and 2 beta-OHT compared to females; the decreased production (#P< 0. 001) of 6 beta-OHT and 16 alfa-OHT in young rabbits versus adult ones.

40|$|Aromatic choline esters {{are natural}} {{compounds}} occurring in Brassicaceae especially in rapeseed among whom {{the most important}} is called sinapine (choline ester of the 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 hydroxycinnamic acid). Choline esters are easily hydrolysed by entero bacteria in digestive tractus giving the correspondent acid and a choline molecule. Choline could then be broken down, by a deaminase, into trimethylamine, compound inducing a negative flavour ("fishy odour") in the milk, the meat or in yolk. So, the method improved in our laboratory is a power tool for breeders and other scientists who would like to evaluate individual aromatic choline esters in seeds or meals. Seeds (10 g) are first ground in a coffee mill (20 sec). 200 mg of ground seeds are weighed in a test tube and then placed in a water bath (75 °C). Then 10 ml of boiling methanol/acetic acid (0. 05 M) mixture (70 / 30) are added plus 0. 5 ml of internal standard solution (3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoic choline ester, 10 µmol/ml). The heterogeneous content is stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min. Only one extraction step is necessary to obtain good results. Then, 1 ml of crude extract is purified with a cation exchange column (CM Sephadex C 25 - 120). Aromatic choline esters are eluted with acetic acid 1 N.

40|$|The 11 β-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} (11 β-HSD) {{is responsible}} for the interconversion of both the hormonally inactive cortisone and the active cortisol. This enzyme activity, which has implications in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, is reflected in the ratio of tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (allo-tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisol) to those of cortisone (tetrahydrocortisone). Several methods have been proposed in the literature to determine such a ratio in urine. Most of them require tedious and extensive extraction and derivatization steps and make use of gas-chromatographic techniques, including gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). We present here an alternative approach for the direct determination of such a ratio in urine by using liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS–MS), based on a minimal sample treatment. Actually, the limit of detections (LODs) for pure standards in water permitted a simple dilution of the urine samples prior to the analysis, hence, an accurate optimization of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was needed in order {{to get rid of the}} severe influence of the urine matrix on the ionization efficiency.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{development}} of low-temperature processes for transition metal carbide and MAX-phase thin film growth. Magnetron sputtering and evaporation, far from thermodynamical equilibrium, have been utilised to engineer the properties of the films by physical and chemical control. Deposition of W, W 2 C and β-WC 1 -x films with controlled microstructure, from nanocrystalline to epitaxial, is shown in the W-C system down to 100 oC. W films with upto 20 at% C exhibited an extreme solid-solution hardening effect, with a nanoindentation hardness maximum of 35 GPa. Furthermore, the design of epitaxial ternary carbide films is demonstrated in the Ti 1 -xVxCy system in the form of controlled unit-cell parameters, strain-free films with a perfect match to the substrate, and <b>ternary</b> epitaxial <b>gradient</b> films. Moreover, phase stabilisation and pseudomorphic growth can be tuned in (Nb,Mo) C and (Ti,W) C films. The results obtained can be used for example to optimise electrical contacts in SiC high-power semiconductor devices. A large part of this thesis focuses on the deposition of MAX-phases. These compounds constitute a family of thermally stable nanolaminates with composition Mn+ 1 AXn, n= 1, 2 or 3, where M is an early transition metal, A is generally a group 13 - 14 element, and X is C or N. They show a combination of typical ceramic and metallic properties and are also machinable by virtue of the unique deformation behaviour observed only in laminates. So far, the MAX-phases have almost exclusively been prepared by high-temperature sintering and studied in bulk form. However, this thesis establishes a patented seed layer approach for successful MAX-phase thin film depositions down to 750 oC. For the first time, single-phase and epitaxial films of Ti 3 SiC 2, Ti 3 AlC 2 and Ti 2 AlC have been grown. The method has also been used to synthesise a new MAX-phase, Ti 4 SiC 3. In addition, two previously unreported intergrown MAX-type structures are presented, Ti 5 Si 2 C 3 and Ti 7 Si 2 C 5. Combined theoretical and experimental results show the possibility to deposit films with very low bulk resistivity and designed mechanical properties. Furthermore, the demonstration of MAX-phase and carbide multilayer films paves the way for macrostructure engineering, for example, in coatings for low-friction or wear applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{the natural}} {{flavonoid}} fisetin (3, 3 ', 4 ', 7 -tetrahydroxyflavone) has been recently {{identified as an}} anticancer agent with antiangiogenic properties in mice, its in vivo pharmacokinetics and metabolism are presently not characterized. Our purpose {{was to determine the}} pharmacokinetics and metabolism of fisetin in mice and determine the biological activity of a detected fisetin metabolite. After fisetin administration of an efficacious dose of 223 mg/kg i. p. in mice, the maximum fisetin concentration reached 2. 5 μg/ml at 15 min and the plasma concentration declined biphasically with a rapid half-life of 0. 09 h and a terminal half-life of 3. 1 h. Three metabolites were detected, one of which was a glucuronide of fisetin (M 1), whereas another glucuronide (M 2) was a glucuronide of a previously unknown fisetin metabolite (M 3). HPLC-MS/MS analysis indicated that M 3 was a methoxylated metabolite of fisetin (MW= 300 Da). The UV spectrum of M 3 was identical to that of fisetin and standard 3, 4 ', 7 -trihydroxy- 3 '-methoxyflavone (geraldol). In addition, because M 3 co-eluted with standard geraldol in 4 different chromatographic <b>ternary</b> <b>gradient</b> conditions, M 3 was therefore assigned to geraldol. Of interest, this metabolite was shown to achieve higher concentrations than fisetin in Lewis lung tumors. We also compared the cytotoxic and antiangiogenic activities of fisetin and geraldol in vitro and {{it was found that the}} latter was more cytotoxic than the parent compound toward tumor cells, and that it could also inhibit endothelial cells migration and proliferation. In conclusion, these results suggest that fisetin metabolism plays an important role in its in vivo anticancer activities...|$|E

The lipid class content in the remnant particles of these lipoproteins is a determinant for the accumulation of lipids in macrophages and their transformation into foam cells. We have optimized a method for the simultaneous determination of cholesteryl esters (CE), triacylglycerols (TG), free cholesterol (FC), monoacylglycerols (MG), and phospholipids (PL) by HPLC coupled to a light-scattering detector (ELSD). A diol column and a <b>ternary</b> <b>gradient</b> of hexane, 2 -propanol, and methanol were applied to CM and VLDL of human origin (n = 10), with excellent precision in terms of repeatability of peak areas and retention times. All peaks were baseline resolved although the resolution of CE and TG was compromised for the sake of simplicity of the solvent gradient. The ELSD response was fitted to second-order equations, with correlation coefficients (r 2) higher than 0. 999 {{for a wide range of}} concentrations (0. 25 – 10 μg of lipid injected). TG were the major lipid class detected in human TRL, accounting for 62 % in CM obtained 2 h after the oil intake. In addition we recorded a depletion of TG and CE in CM obtained 2 h after the oil intake of about 60 %. We conclude that the method reported here is suitable for a rapid and precise determination of lipid classes in human TRL and, therefore, may be a useful tool for investigations on the atherogenicity of these lipoproteins.

40|$|Many {{physical}} properties, {{for example}} structural or magnetic, of a material are directly dependent on elemental composition. Tailoring of properties through highly accurate composition control {{is possible in}} thin films. This work exemplifies such tailoring. A short review is given of the current status for {{research in the area}} of permanent magnets, focusing on rare earth element free alternatives, where FeNi in the L 10 phase is a possible candidate. Epitaxial FeNi L 10 thin films were successfully synthesized by magnetron sputtering deposition of monoatomic layers of Fe and Ni on HF-etched Si(001) substrates with Cu or Cu 100 -xNix/Cu buffers. The in-plane lattice parameter aCuNi of the Cu 100 -xNix buffer layer was tuned by the Ni content. Through matching of aFeNi to aCuNi, the strain state (c/a) FeNi was controlled, where c is the out-of-plane lattice parameter. The 001 reflection indicative of chemical order, as measured by resonant x-ray diffraction, was in most cases split in two peaks due to a composition modulation of Fe and Ni. This chemical disorder contributed to that the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, KU≈ 0. 35 MJ/m 3, was smaller than predicted. In later experiments the composition modulation could partly be compensated for. Remaining discrepancies with respect to predicted KU values were attributed to additional disorder induced by surface roughness of the buffer layer. The interface sharpness between Fe and Ni was explored by producing epitaxial symmetric multilayers with individual layer thicknesses n = 4 - 48 monolayers (ML). For n ≤ 8 ML the films had pure fcc structure, with antiferromagnetic Fe layers. For n ≥ 8 ML the Fe layers relaxed to bcc structure. A combinatorial sputter chamber, which has the capability to deposit samples with composition and thickness gradients, was assembled. A model for simulation of composition and thickness across large substrates, for the conditions in this chamber, is presented. The model is verified by comparison to experimental data. Some challenges inherent in combinatorial sputtering are discussed, and two experimental studies employing the technique are presented as examples.

40|$|The European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL-FA), {{hosted by}} the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a Directorate General of the European Commission, is, among other tasks, {{mandated}} to provide scientific support to National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) {{in the field of}} the control of the authorised feed additives [1]. In this frame the EURL-FA has been contacted in June 2013 by an official control laboratory and its related National Reference Laboratory regarding severe technical problems when implementing an official method established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] for the determination of a specific coccidiostat, diclazuril, authorised as feed additive by the EU legislation [3]. The EURL-FA first conducted a survey among all NRLs for feed additives control & authorisation to gather their experiences with the Community method for the determination of diclazuril at authorised additive level in feed. The information provided by the NRL's hinted at a major flaw in a specific part of the method description of the Commission Regulation. Following the survey and reporting the issue to the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), it was decided to implement the method described in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] at the premises of the EURL-FA Control in order to identify the technical reason for this problem. The study performed at the EURL-FA Control confirmed the lack of fitness for purpose reported by the laboratories and due to a significant error in the method description as given in the European Commission Regulation [2]. The method was therefore modified at the EURL-FA Control and the results from the single-laboratory validation of this method showed satisfactory performance characteristics. Moreover, a modification of Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 was considered necessary, to remove the error in the corresponding method description. In the 2014 annual workshops (EURL-FA Control and EURL-FA Authorisation) the results of the implementation, optimisation and validation of the method at the EURL-FA were presented to both networks of NRLs and discussion was launched on how to cope with this problem in the best way. As a conclusion, it was decided that the EURL-FA would organise a collaborative study among the NRLs in order to evaluate the fitness for purpose of the optimised method, which corrects the error found in the method description. This collaborative study was conducted in 2015 and the EURL-FA presented the results in the annual workshops of the EURL-FA Authorisation and EURL-FA Control respectively, in November 2015. The main aim of the collaborative study presented here was to assess the method performance characteristics of the corrected method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to spectrophotometric detection (LC-UV or LC-DAD) for the determination of diclazuril at additive level in feed. The required target limits of detection and quantification were respectively 0. 1 mg kg- 1 and 0. 5 mg kg- 1. According to the standard operational procedure (SOP) of the corrected method, the test portion, after addition of an internal standard, was extracted with acidified methanol and an aliquot of the extract was purified on a C 18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, containing 5000 mg of the SPE sorbent. Diclazuril was eluted from the cartridge with a mixture of acidified methanol and water. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMFA) / water. The content of diclazuril was determined by <b>ternary</b> <b>gradient</b> reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV spectrophotometry detector measuring at 280 nm. In total 5 samples corresponding to 4 blind duplicates and 1 blank feed were sent to 15 laboratories and 14 laboratories reported results. Statistical evaluation revealed that the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 4. 5 % to 11. 2 % and the relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 14. 3 % and 18. 1 %. The method showed acceptable within-laboratory and between-laboratory precision, since the calculated HORRAT values were in all cases below the critical value of 1. 5. In addition, no false positive was found. Based on the data of the collaborative study and on the discussions, it was concluded during the workshops of 2015 that the EURL-FA will submit to the European Commission a recommendation for the revision of the current Community method. The recommendation will include a proposal for the final text of the method, drafted by the EURL-FA and consolidated after review by the NRLs (Authorisation and Control networks), for its inclusion in the revised Regulation replacing (EC) No 152 / 2009.
