2500|$|During its investigation, the NTSB {{found the}} #2 tire failed because it threw off its (recapped) tread. [...] Then, the #1 tire failed {{because it was}} {{overloaded}} and had fatigue in its ply structure. [...] Then, the #5 tire failed, because it was hit with shrapnel from the rim of either the #2 or the #1 tire. [...] The failure of that third tire on the left main gear, probably contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> breaking through the non-load bearing pavement beyond {{the end of the}} runway, which in turn caused the gear to fail and puncture the fuel tanks. [...] Additionally, the NTSB stated: [...] "The tires on the aircraft may have been operated in the overdeflected condition, since the average inflation pressure was less than the optimum pressure for maximum gross weight." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. Each {{of these}} {{featured}} a special badge with an identification number mounted next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> selector, and were {{finished with a}} white exterior, wheels, and interior. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer {{to that of the}} base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained {{at the top of the}} rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> hydraulic motor operated but <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> did not extend. After several seconds of <b>gear</b> motor operation <b>the</b> circuit breaker for <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> motor popped. Further attempts <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A gear up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> was extended {{by use of}} <b>the</b> manual <b>gear</b> extension emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> by use of the backup hydraulic pump because <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> down solenoid had overheated during attempts <b>to</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> and froze in <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing they were able <b>to</b> manually lower <b>the</b> <b>gear.</b> Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch which resulted in <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system. Contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accident was the overheating of <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> down solenoid which caused it <b>to</b> stick in <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> up position and prevented <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> from being manually extended.|$|R

2500|$|According to his {{autobiography}} Veeck – As in Wreck, Veeck {{claimed to have}} installed a screen {{to make the right}} field target a little more difficult for left-handed pull hitters of the opposing team. The screen was on wheels, so any given day it might be in place or not, depending on the batting strength of the opposing team. There was no rule against that activity as such, but Veeck then took it to an extreme, rolling it out when the opponents batted, and pulling it back when the Brewers batted. Veeck reported that the league passed a rule against it the very next day. However, extensive research by two members of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) suggests that this story was made up by Veeck. [...] The two researchers could not find any references to a moveable fence or any reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> required for a moveable fence to work.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the games had included Nostrums as gameplay elements, but these were replaced by equipable gear. Nostrums would have made permanent changes to the character and cannot be removed once used. They would have been available in two types, stable and unstable varieties, the latter referred to as [...] "potlucks". Stable nostrums would have been expensive, but the player would know exactly what effect applying the nostrum would gain them. Unstable nostrums would be cheaper or found lying around the environment, but upon use, would require the player to select one of four random effects to alter their character, an idea inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic according to Levine. The Nostrum system was scrapped in favor of using gear as {{they found that the}} system was too similar to other ones that the player would have available in equipping their character, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> option. Similarly, earlier demonstrations of the game did not use Salt to power vigors, but instead each vigor would have a limited number of uses before it was exhausted. While more can be found around the game's environment, the player would have only been able to carry a limited number of vigors into battle, with more powerful vigors containing fewer charges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission also has <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> shift points, and hold <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> longer when <b>the</b> engine is operating at higher RPM. This {{is achieved by}} pressing the accelerator pedal rapidly, which causes <b>the</b> transmission <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> until 5000 rpm before shifting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next <b>gear.</b> No indicator light appears in the instrument cluster, unlike previous generations. The transmission also has engine over-rev protection by shifting <b>the</b> transmission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next available <b>gear</b> once 6500 rpm has been achieved, even if <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> selector is in a low gear position.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{eccentric}} <b>gearing</b> has {{a planetary}} gear (3) {{which has a}} driving gear (32) which engages with driven hollow <b>gear</b> (4). <b>The</b> planetary <b>gear</b> also has a coaxial support gear (5) which is axially offset <b>to</b> driving <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> support <b>gear</b> is a component of a one-piece gear cover (2) which is connected to a supporting part of the vehicle seat. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> cover is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gearing</b> housing (1), and has a cylindrical pin (7) for bearing the driving wheel set (8). ADVANTAGE - Is compact and enables a large gear ratio...|$|R

That I don't know, but he'll probably try to get on board the Minella if he's afraid of you. She's billed on a stopping trip for Lagos, but she'll edge close round Twin Point Bluff, and he'll no doubt try to board her there. There's a nice southwester blowing now, and under the big lugsail we ought to overhaul the canoe before he does so. She can't have got far until the breeze sprang up." ...|$|E
6000|$|As they {{advanced}} to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though uttered in a low tone. Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or twice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, [...] "We had best make haste," [...] said he to his companions, [...] "for our friend must be in extremis, as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help. Come, let us <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear.</b> I will go up the ladder first and cut the rope. Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the body, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed. Keep sure gripe, for which the bandages will afford you convenience.

60|$|As I was {{returning}} from the grave, Jaap and the Trackless came in from their scout. The report they made was perfectly satisfactory. By the trail, which they followed for miles, the squatters had actually absconded, pushing for some distant point, and nothing more was to be feared from them {{in that part of}} the country. I now gave my orders as respected the goods and chattels of the family, which were neither very numerous nor very valuable; and it may as well be said here as later, that everything was done next day, strictly according to promise. The first of the messages that I received from Prudence came within a month, acknowledging the receipt of her effects, even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> of the mill, and expressing her deep gratitude for the favor. I have reason to think, too, that nearly half the lumber fell into the hands of these squatters, quite that portion of it being in the stream at the time we removed from the spot, and floating off with the rains that soon set in. What was found at a later day was sold, and the proceeds were appropriated to meet the expenses of, and to make presents to the posse, as an encouragement to such persons to see the majesty of the laws maintained.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The {{vessel was}} much knocked {{about in a}} violent gale in June off Norfolk Island, {{and we had to}} handle her very carefully. The whole voyage was made with a {{mainmast}} badly sprung, and fore topmast very shaky. Mr. Tilly was very watchful over the spars, and though we had a large share of squally weather, and for some days, at different times, were becalmed in a heavy swell, the most trying of all situations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> of a vessel, yet, thank God, all went well, and I have heard of the schooner safe in Auckland harbour. About forty of our Melanesians here are Solomon Islanders, from seven different islands; a few came from the New Hebrides, the rest from the Banks Islands. We are already pretty well settled down to our work. Indeed, it took only a day or two to get to work; our old scholars are such great helpers to us. We number six clergymen here (G. Sarawia being at Mota). Ten or twelve of the sixth form are teachers. If you care to hear more; I must refer you to a letter just written to Miss Yonge. But {{it is not easy to}} write details about 134 young people. Their temptations are very great when they return to their islands; every inducement to profligacy, &c., is held out to them. One of our young baptized lads fell into sinful ways, and is not now with us. He was not one of whom we had great expectations, though we trusted that he would go on steadily. Many others, thank God, were kept pure and truthful in the midst of it all, refusing even to sleep one night away from our little hut, and in some cases refusing even to leave the schooner. [...] "No, I will wait till I am married," [...] said two lads to me, who were married here to Christian girls on November 24th, [...] "and then go ashore for a time with my young wife. I don't think I should yield, but I don't want to put myself in the way of such temptations." [...] And so, when I had naturally expected that they would take their six weeks' holiday on shore, while the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] went from Mota to Norfolk Island and back (during my stay at Mota), they remained on board, rejoining me, as they were two of my boating crew, for the New Hebrides trip! This was very comforting. And when I married three couples on November 24th, and knew that they were pure, youths and girls alike, from the great sin of heathenism, you can well think that my heart was very full of thankfulness and hope.|$|E
