5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both joined <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E

He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> between 1986 and 1990. During the March 1989 Soviet Union legislative election, the first relatively free Soviet elections, Snetkov, who was backed by <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> lost his seat, which represented a district in Yaroslavl, to reformist Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Podziruk, in a campaign focused {{on the issue of}} the existence of the Soviet draft.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which {{had been set up}} as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. <b>The</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

5|$|The post-World War II Sabor {{developed}} from the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), formed in 1943. In 1945, ZAVNOH transformed itself into the National Sabor of Croatia, preserving the continuity of Croatian sovereignty. After the war, the Communists ran unopposed in the 1945 elections; all opposition parties boycotted the elections due to coercion and intimidation by the OZNA secret police and <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> aimed at eliminating electoral dissent. Once in power, the Communists introduced a single-party political system, with <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Yugoslavia as the ruling party and <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Croatia as a branch party. In January 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. During Communist rule, the Sabor went from a unicameral parliament as specified by the 1947 constitution, to bicameral in 1953, changing again in 1963 {{to as many as}} five chambers, and then to three in 1974. The constitutional amendments of 1971 established the Presidency of the Sabor, and one of its functions became representing Croatia, as the Yugoslav constituent republics were essentially viewed as nation-states generally surrendering only their foreign and defence policies to the federation; the federal bodies were no longer independent of, but instead formed by, the republics.|$|E
