Departing Bremerhaven 8 May she arrived at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 19 May for conversion to a naval vessel. The need for a one-stop oiler-replenishment type ship had been illustrated by {{the war in the}} Pacific, and Dithmarschen was used for experimental work in this field since she had been developed specifically for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> She was redesignated AO-110 on 1 October 1946 (the construction of USS Conecuh (AO-103) had been cancelled on 18 August 1945), but lack of funds delayed her conversion and she was placed out of service on 24 October.|$|E
50|$|Following {{several days}} of trials, PCS-1376 {{departed}} Long Island for shakedown training {{in the vicinity of}} Cuba. At the conclusion of the cruise in August, she reported for duty as a school ship at the Submarine Chaser School located at Miami, Florida. The warship did double duty until the end of 1943 conducting anti-submarine patrols at night and training submarine chaser nucleus crews in the daytime. On New Year's Day 1944, she discontinued her nightly anti-submarine patrols and concentrated on preparing crews to man new submarine chasers. On 1 October 1944, she also gave up training duty but continued to support the schools mission by acting as an escort for larger ships conducting the actual at-sea training. That <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> lasted until the cessation of hostilities of World War II in August 1945, at which time she resumed actual onboard training.|$|E

[...] In this [...] "new" [...] capacity, the ship performed the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> common to Coast Guard cutters — the removal of menaces to navigation and the assistance to ships in distress. For the next few weeks, basing at New London, Acushnet rendered assistance to the steamer Mahoning and the steamer Lake Crystal.

50|$|For the 1995 model year, the A4LD was {{upgraded}} to feature full electronic controls, {{resulting in a}} new transmission family. The two major versions of this new transmission were the 4R44E and 4R55E. In Europe, the 4R44E was known simply as the A4LDE (with the E referring to the electronic enhancements to the basic A4LD design) and was briefly used in the Ford Scorpio. The transmissions are fundamentally similar in design, varying only in the durability of key components based on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> {{they were to be}} used for. The 4R44E was used in lighter-duty applications, namely with 4-cylinder or 3.0 L V6 models of the Ford Ranger pickup, while the 4R55E was used in heavier-duty applications, specifically with the 4.0 L Cologne V6 used in vehicles like the said Ford Ranger or Ford Explorer. The 4R55E was short-lived however as it was replaced in all instances where it was used with the newer 5R55E during the 1997 model year. The 4R44E continued on {{through the end of the}} 1990s before being replaced by the 5R55E's relative, the 5R44E.|$|E
5000|$|Placed in full {{commission}} on 17 May 1937 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Antares was assigned temporary duty with the Naval Transportation Service (a forerunner {{of the later}} Military Sea Transportation Service and the Military Sealift Command), and operated on both east and west coasts. She also operated with the Training Detachment, United States Fleet, and while assigned to this unit participated in Fleet Landing Exercise No. 4 in February 1938. In his report of the evolution, Rear Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson—Commander, Training Detachment—considered that Antares—which had acted as a [...] "utility auxiliary"—had proved [...] "indispensable". He commended her performance of duty, which had been performed {{in spite of a}} [...] "crammed schedule, allowing little or no time for upkeep." [...] Antares was the only ship available which could handle the experimental tank lighter, artillery lighter, and other heavy marine equipment. [...] "Her design," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "except for speed, is ideal for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> performed, and without her services serious curtailment of the operations would have been necessary." ...|$|E

50|$|Practically, {{this logic}} may be {{recognizing}} {{the fact that}} employers {{should be able to}} discern between on-duty and off-duty injuries and should be able to treat them differently. The common distinction rewards workers who perform certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> (ultrahazardous jobs) and allows employers to keep costs lower by not having to accommodate everyone with such a request. The majority's opinion is perhaps best conceptualized as splitting the difference between these two important policy issues: supporting the accommodation of pregnant workers but allowing employers to accommodate only some of its workforce.|$|R
5000|$|Presumably, if {{a person}} has {{positive}} rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher Henry Shue is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more [...] "negative" [...] or [...] "positive") requires both kinds <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a [...] "negative" [...] duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" [...] duties). The negative positive distinction may {{be a matter of}} emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe any right as though it requires only one <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> assigned [...] sea or shore [...] {{at the point}} of separation for those non-prior-service (NPS) males who left the Navy before expiration of their initial enlistment contract, using a fiscal year's cohort of accessions drawn from the Navy Enlisted Tracking File (STF). Demographic and organizational attributes of cohort members are described, as well as characterizations of service and reasons for loss of those who left prematurely. Previous research using situational variables suggested the possibility that initial assignment to shore duty after training might be a higher attrition risk than assignment to sea duty for NPS males. The data for this cohort indicate that the predominance of shore processing activities as separating commands obscure the question of whether a premature loss should be attributed to a sea or shore command, and that assumptions about initial assignment to shore duty based on type-duty variable are suspect because of the probability that processing, holding and corrections commands are included under the designation of shore commands.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} information technology to support business processes has emphasised {{the need for}} information security mechanisms. This, however, has resulted in an ever-increasing workload in terms of security administration. Policy-based approaches have been proposed, promising to lighten the workload of security administrators. Separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> the principles cited as a requirement when setting up these policy-based mechanisms. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> policies exist.
