5|$|Claimants {{from the}} line of Moana Wahine made {{petitions}} to the court under the act of 1874 to quite land titles. The act was later deemed unconstitutional and a new decree of heirship was made.

After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill surrendered her lease on the house and it was {{opened to the public}} by the Trust in 1966. A Grade I listed building, for its historical significance rather than its architectural merit, Chartwell has become among the Trust's most popular properties; some 232,000 people visited the house in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening.|$|E

The suit was ongoing for several years afterwards, and a CPA filed a counter-lawsuit in response, charging that Wall's family, not the FLDS or the UEP Trust, was responsible for her underage marriage. In June 2009, she offered to settle the suit for $308,000, the land her family lives on, and some other properties.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area.

An inevitable tension exists between {{the needs of the}} 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the needs of the many millions of people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Almshouses on East Street {{were founded}} by Robert Gray in 1615 for poor single women. The red brick {{buildings}} bear {{the arms of}} Robert Gray, dated 1635, and another arms of the Merchant Tailors. A small room is used as chapel and has original benches and a painted ceiling. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. St Margaret's Almshouses was founded as a leper colony in the 12th century. Glastonbury Abbey acquired the patronage of the hospital in the late 13thcentury and rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th century. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued {{to be used as}} almshouses, cared for by a local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. It later fell into disrepair until the Somerset Buildings Preservation <b>Trust</b> <b>with</b> Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it for use as four dwellings of social housing. It is a gradeII* listed building.|$|E

Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their <b>trust.</b> <b>With</b> Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she {{raised the issue of}} the Scottish Futures <b>Trust</b> <b>with</b> Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.|$|E

5|$|No. 1 Royal Crescent is a {{historic}} house museum, owned and maintained by the Bath Preservation Trust through its membership to illustrate how wealthy owners of the late 18th century might have furnished and occupied such a house. It was purchased in 1967 by Major Bernard Cayzer, {{a member of the}} family that made its fortune through the Clan shipping line. He donated it to the <b>Trust</b> <b>with</b> an amount of money for its restoration and furnishing. The restoration was led by Philip Jebb. The Bath Preservation Trust was working during 2012–13 to re-unite Number One with its original servants' wing at Number 1A Royal Crescent, which has been in use as a separate dwelling for many years. No. 1 serves as the Trust's headquarters. Number 15 and 16 are still used as a hotel.|$|E
5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable <b>trust,</b> <b>with</b> representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E

The LSO arranged a series of concerts conducted by Wood, with whom the orchestra was completely reconciled. When the BBC evacuated its orchestra from London and abandoned the Proms, the LSO took over for Wood. The Carnegie <b>Trust,</b> <b>with</b> the support of the British government, contracted the LSO to tour Britain, taking live music to towns where symphony concerts were hitherto unknown.|$|E

5|$|Carre's Grammar School is a {{selective}} secondary school for boys in Sleaford, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. Founded on 1 September 1604 by an indenture of Robert Carre, {{the school was}} funded by rents from farmland and run {{by a group of}} trustees. The indenture restricted the endowment to £20 without accounting for inflation, causing the school to decline during the 18th century and effectively close in 1816. Revived by a decree from the Court of Chancery in 1830, new buildings were constructed at its present site and the school re-opened in 1835. Faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools and declining rolls, Carre's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its Classical curriculum by affiliating with Kesteven County Council in 1895. Following the Education Act 1944, school fees were abolished and Carre's became Voluntary Aided. New buildings were completed in 1966 to house the rising number of students. After plans for comprehensive education in Sleaford came to nothing in the 1970s and 1980s, Carre's converted to grant-maintained status in 1990. Foundation status followed and the school became an Academy in 2011; a multi-Academy <b>trust</b> <b>with</b> Kesteven and Sleaford High School was formed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{was a more}} {{hands-on}} owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed {{construction of}} the Forum in 1967 {{at a cost of}} $16.5million. He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67million. Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce. Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate. Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998, and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well. Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league. Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West. In 2013, Buss {{died at the age of}} 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer. His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a <b>trust,</b> <b>with</b> each child receiving an equal vote. Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.|$|E
