40|$|AbstractIntensive {{aquaculture}} systems, particularly recirculating systems, utilize {{equipment such as}} aerators, air {{and water}} pumps, blowers, and filtration systems that inadvertently increase noise levels in fish culture tanks. Sound levels and frequencies measured within intensive aquaculture systems are {{within the range of}} fish hearing, but species-specific effects of aquaculture production noise are not well defined. Field and laboratory studies have shown that fish behavior and physiology can be negatively impacted by intense sound. Therefore, chronic exposure to aquaculture production noise could cause increased stress, reduced growth rates and feed conversion efficiency, and decreased survival. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide an in-depth evaluation of the long term effects of aquaculture production noise on the growth, condition factor, feed conversion efficiency, and survival of cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Rainbow trout were cultured in replicated tanks using two sound treatments: 117  dB re 1  μPa RMS which represented sound levels lower than those recorded in an intensive recycle system and 149  dB re 1  μPa RMS, representing sound levels near the upper limits known to occur in recycle systems. To begin the study mean fish weights in the 117 and 149  dB tanks were 40 and 39  g, respectively. After five months of exposure no significant differences were identified between treatments for mean weight, length, specific growth rates, condition factor, feed conversion, or survival (n= 4). Mean final weights for the 117 and 149  dB treatments were 641 ± 3 and 631 ± 10  g, respectively. Overall specific growth rates were equal, i. e. 1. 84 ± 0. 00 and 1. 84 ± 0. 01 %/day. Analysis of growth rates of individually tagged rainbow trout indicated that fish from the 149  dB <b>tanks</b> <b>grew</b> slower during the first month of noise exposure (p< 0. 05); however, fish acclimated to the noise thereafter. This study further suggests that rainbow trout growth and survival are unlikely to be affected over the long term by noise levels common to intensive aquaculture systems...|$|R

Effects of non-native fish in tropical freshwater systems are commonly presumed but poorly understood. I present {{an approach to}} assess potential adverse changes in the native fish assemblage resulting from the presence of feral Oreochromis niloticus, which has an expansive naturalized range. This research is organized around an ecological risk model, consisting of a fault-tree of events. I present my findings for exposure events (site, habitat and dietary overlap) and effects events (interference competition and change in growth rates), which may lead to adverse changes in native assemblages in streams in the Eastern River system in Thailand. My research addresses two assumptions regarding the ecological risk assessment of O. niloticus in Thailand, that native piscivores, Channa spp., limit population establishment and hence ecological risk, and an economically important native species, Trichogaster trichopterus, is declining due to competition with O. niloticus. I found that Channa spp., T. trichopterus, and O. niloticus were syntopic and had high dietary overlap. When present, O. niloticus were more highly abundant than other species; which suggests their successful establishment. Native fish assemblages at O. niloticus sites {{were not significantly different}} from those at un-invaded sites, and non-native species were the only strong indicators of sites with non-natives present. Therefore, Channa spp. did not limit establishment of O. niloticus, and T. trichopterus could be negatively affected via competition with juvenile O. niloticus. I then tested whether O. niloticus adversely affect T. trichopterus through competition in laboratory experiments to determine the mechanism and outcome of competition between individuals and species in single and mixed species treatments at varying densities. Dominant fish in each <b>tank</b> <b>grew</b> more than subordinates, and O. niloticus were the dominant species in 67. 7 % of all mixed species tanks. The growth rate of T. trichopterus declined significantly in the presence of selectively bred O. niloticus, but the growth rate of O. niloticus was not noticeably affected by the presence of T. trichopterus. My study documents resource overlap, resource competition, and the effects of competition on growth. As such, it provides valuable insight into the ecology and conservation of native aquatic biodiversity in tropical freshwater systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the initial tank temperature {{on the evolution of}} the internal gas temperature during the refueling of on-board hydrogen tanks is investigated in this paper. Two different types of tanks, four different fuel delivery temperatures (from ambient temperature refueling to a pre-cooled hydrogen at - 40 °C), several filling rates and initial pressures are considered. It is found that the final gas temperature increases linearly with the increase of the initial tank temperature while the temperature increase and the final state of charge (SOC) decrease linearly with increasing initial temperature. The final temperature dependency on the initial temperature is larger with type III than with type IV <b>tank,</b> and <b>grows</b> with increasing initial pressure. Additionally CFD simulations are performed to better understand the role of the relevant phenomena on the gas temperature histories e. g. gas compression, gas mixing, and heat transfer.
