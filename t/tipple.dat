5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal <b>tipple</b> at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Harris again gains {{the upper hand}} when he offers Ann {{information}} about their kidnapped daughter {{in exchange for the}} tape, Sue Ellen tells Ann to go ahead. However, her secret bribery comes out {{on the eve of the}} election and she loses the election and twelve donors towards her foundation. Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself a glass of wine (in the original series, her favorite <b>tipple</b> was Vodka). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, a spark of their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend Elena Ramos out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, a coal <b>tipple</b> was {{typically}} used at a bituminous coal mine, where removing impurities was important but sorting by size {{was only a}} secondary, minor concern. Coal breakers were always used (with or without a <b>tipple)</b> at anthracite mines. While tipples were used around the world, coal breakers were used primarily in the United States {{in the state of}} Pennsylvania (where, between 1800 and the mid-20th century, many of the world's known anthracite reserves were located).|$|E
50|$|After {{crossing}} the weighbridge, the tramlines enter two tipplers. The tipplers comprise {{a section of}} track located between two metal hoops. The whole assembly pivots so when a skip is parked in the <b>tippler,</b> it can be tipped onto its side so the contents can be emptied. The first <b>tippler</b> empties via the space formerly occupied by the screening plant onto the picking belt. The second <b>tippler,</b> located at {{the western end of}} the pithead empties via a hopper into a wagon parked on the railway siding.|$|R
50|$|The pier {{was at the}} end of {{a narrow}} gauge tramway from a colliery. The wagons would be brought right to the edge of the canal to be <b>tippled</b> so that their {{contents}} went straight into the waiting barges. The original wooden pier is believed to have been demolished in 1929, with the iron from the <b>tippler</b> being sold as scrap. Because of the more recent pride in the area's heritage, a replica <b>tippler,</b> consisting of two curved rails, has been erected at the original location.|$|R

This incarnation reappears in Happy Endings by Paul Cornell, Virgin Publishing's celebratory fiftieth Virgin New Adventures novel. After the broadcast of the television movie, some fans suggested that this is the incarnation briefly played by Gordon <b>Tipple</b> in the prologue, eventually succumbing once again to the cheetah virus in the first Eighth Doctor novel The Eight Doctors.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Matewan, {{testimony}} in the case revealed that C. E. Lively had infiltrated the union for the company. Lively later testified before the United States Senate {{that he had been}} a Baldwin-Felts detective since 1912 or 1913. During that time he had worked undercover, with his duties taking him to Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. During the Ludlow strike in Colorado, Lively became vice-president of the United Mine Workers' local at La Veta. He returned to Mingo County, West Virginia in early 1920. He worked undercover at Howard Collieries, a company that had a <b>tipple</b> destroyed by fire. The investigation was kept secret even from the coal company, and Lively was fired when he was suspected of complicity.|$|E

[...] By this time the steamer was owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company which arranged to have its wheat dock located near the coal tipples for its steam locomotives. [...] Moored at the wheat dock, as was often the case, was a ship loading wheat, and across the river from the ship was the Willamette Chief. [...] Somehow a fire ignited at a coal <b>tipple,</b> perhaps caused by inflammable coal dust. [...] The burning <b>tipple</b> ignited the wheat dock. [...] Men on the dock desperately hacked at the ship's moorings to get her free before she could catch fire. [...] Just as the wheat ship came free of the dock, the coal <b>tipple</b> collapsed in flames and fire leapt up into the ship's rigging. [...] Drifting free, the burning ship crashed into Willamette Chief which herself was quickly consumed by the fire.|$|E

2500|$|In the prologue, the Master (portrayed briefly by Gordon <b>Tipple)</b> is {{executed}} by the Daleks as a punishment for his [...] "evil crimes". But before his apparent death, the Master requests his remains to be brought back to Gallifrey by the Seventh Doctor. However, as posited in the novelisation of the television movie by Gary Russell, the Master's self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a [...] "morphant". This interpretation is made explicit {{in the first of}} the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, The Eight Doctors by Terrance Dicks, and also used in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story The Fallen, which states that the morphant was a shape-shifting animal native to Skaro.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} twenty years, {{scholars}} like <b>Tipple</b> and Speak have begun to refer to homelessness as the [...] "antithesis or absence of home" [...] rather than rooflessness or the [...] "lack of physical shelter." [...] This complication in the homelessness debate further delineates the idea that home actually consists of an adequate shelter, an experienced and dynamic place {{that serves as a}} [...] "base" [...] for nurturing human relationships and the [...] "free development of individuals" [...] and their identity. Thus, the home is perceived to be an extension of one's self and identity. In contrast, the homeless experience, according to Moore, constitutes more as a [...] "lack of belonging" [...] and a loss of identity that leads to individuals or communities feeling [...] "out of place" [...] once they can no longer call a place of their own home ...|$|E

2500|$|The opening pre-credits {{sequence}} {{went through}} a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. <b>Tipple</b> is still credited as [...] "The Old Master", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as [...] "The Old Doctor"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, as the Master observes Rowan Atkinson's Doctor.|$|E

Baldwin (1866–1933) to establish an undergraduate liberal arts college. The Baldwins were successful attorneys who were raised {{on a farm in}} Cortland, New York. [...] Both brothers attended Cornell University. They established a law firm with former New Jersey governor John Griggs spanning [...] "varied interests in lumbering, manufacturing, transportation, and other enterprises that ranged from owning the Grosvenor Hotel in New York City to Arthur's legal counseling for the rising McGraw-Hill publishing empire." [...] The Baldwins became acquainted with the seminary's president, Ezra Squier <b>Tipple,</b> who [...] "welcomed the brothers to his prominent New York City Methodist Church when they came to Manhattan." [...] Leonard Baldwin eventually became a trustee of the seminary in 1919. The donation originally consisted of $500,000 to build a college building, and $1,000,000 in the form of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A) stock. However, the Baldwins exchanged the stock with a gift of cash in October 1928.|$|E
2500|$|Nivkh's {{traditional}} {{religion was}} based on animist beliefs, especially via shamanism, before colonial Russians made efforts to convert the population to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Nivkh animists believe the island of Sakhalin is a giant beast lying on its belly with the trees of the island as its hair. When the beast is upset, it awakens and trembles the earth causing earthquakes. Nivkh have a pantheon of vaguely defined gods (yz, yzng) that presided over the mountains, rivers, seas and sky. Nivkhs' have extensive folklore, songs, and mythos of how humans and the universe were created, and of how fantastic heroes, spirits and beasts battled {{with each other in}} ancient times. Some Nivkhs have converted to Russian Orthodoxy or other religions, though many still practice traditional beliefs. Fire is especially venerated. It is the symbol of the unity of the clan. Fire is considered a deity of their ancestors, protecting them from evil spirits and guarding their clan from harm. An open flame would be 'fed' a leaf of tobacco, spices, or a <b>tipple</b> of vodka in order to please the spirits for protection. [...] Nivkhs would also frequently offer items to the deities by 'feeding'. The sea would be 'fed' an item of importance in order that the sea god protect the travelers.|$|E

[...] The divorce caused such a stir that Lake was forced to resign the Winn chair on 28 September 1932 and became professor of history in Harvard College, a position he held until his retirement in 1938. [...] Perhaps their most significant project was a magnificent series of ten large albums of facsimiles entitled Dated Greek Minuscule Manuscripts to the Year 1200 (1934–39). [...] These portfolios of reproductions were organized by location and contained photographic specimens of some 400 manuscripts. [...] These were important publications, for they encouraged scholars to look beyond the more well known manuscripts and realize the worth of encompassing a wide range of textual variants in any editing of the Greek text. [...] Together they also founded in 1934 a series of monographs entitled Studies and Documents and contributed a valuable study in 1941 on Family 13 (The Ferrar Group), another New Testament manuscript group.|$|E

The tornado continued northeast and impacted the small village of Bush, killing seven people there. Several homes were leveled, and pieces of wood were speared into the town's water tower. Heavy railroad axles were reportedly lifted and scattered across the railyard. Further east, the mining town of West Frankfort was also devastated by the massive tornado, with 152 fatalities occurring in that area. The tornado struck the northwest side of town, leveling many businesses and sweeping away entire subdivisions. At the Orient Mine, a large multi-ton coal <b>tipple</b> was blown over and rolled by the tornado. Extreme damage continued east of town, as a railroad trestle was torn from its supports, and [...] of railroad track was ripped from the ground and blown away. Several small mining villages in the area were obliterated, resulting in numerous fatalities. The tornado then destroyed the small town of Parrish, where 22 people were killed, and the town was never rebuilt. Severe damage and several fatalities also occurred in the Olga area. Within 40 minutes, 541 lives were lost and 1,423 were seriously injured. The tornado proceeded to devastate rural areas across Hamilton and White counties, claiming 65 more residents before crossing into Indiana.
