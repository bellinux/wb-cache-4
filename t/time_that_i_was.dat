2500|$|After Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn died in 1950, his son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, {{soon became}} the seventh Rebbe. The Rebbe was a passionate {{believer in the}} coming of the mashiach. In a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Schneerson wrote: [...] "From the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child {{attending}} Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form in my imagination -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood." [...] Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the Dira Betachtonim, and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.|$|E
