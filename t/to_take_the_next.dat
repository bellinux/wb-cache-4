Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Brett Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Simon Jones's bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.|$|E

However, this time it was Tsonga who prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match. It was not until another year and a half until they met again, with the stakes even higher, in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011, with the winner advancing to his first Wimbledon final. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final, and in the process ending the seven-and-a-half-year reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal {{at the top of the}} rankings. At the 2012 French Open, Tsonga and Djokovic met again in an important match, in the quarterfinals. After losing the first set, Tsonga rallied <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two sets and held two match points on Djokovic's serve in the fourth set before the Serb fought back to force a tie-break. Despite the Frenchman's saving set points in the breaker, Djokovic took one at the third opportunity. This forced a deciding set, which Tsonga lost after more than four hours of play.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies {{to punish}} Western Xia for their betrayal. Meanwhile, Emperor Shenzong {{stepped down from}} power in 1223, leaving his son, Xianzong, in his place. In 1225, Genghis Khan attacked with a force of approximately 180,000. After taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols began a steady advance southward. Asha, commander of the Western Xia troops, {{could not afford to}} meet the Mongols as it would involve an exhausting westward march from the capital Yinchuan through 500 kilometers of desert. With no army to meet them in pitched battle, the Mongols picked the best targets for attack and as each city fell the Mongols would draw on prisoners, defectors, supplies, and weapons <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> one. Enraged by Western Xia's fierce resistance, Genghis engaged the countryside in annihilative warfare and ordered his generals to systematically destroy cities and garrisons as they went. Two months after taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols reached a point where the Qilian Mountains force the Etsin River eastward, about 300 kilometers south of Khara-Khoto. At this point, Genghis divided his army, sending general Subutai {{to take care of the}} westernmost cities, while the main force moved east into the heart of the Western Xia Empire. Genghis lay siege to Suzhou, which fell after five weeks. Genghis then moved to Ganzhou, the hometown of his general Chagaan. Chagaan's father still commanded the city garrison, so Chagaan attempted negotiations with him. However, the second-in-command of the city staged a coup, killed Chagaan's father, and refused to surrender. The city took five months to subdue, and though the now furious Genghis threatened vengeance, Chagaan convinced him to only kill the 35 conspirators who killed Chagaan's father.|$|E

Objeas praised Selena's [...] "complete ease on the R tunes" [...] and thought she was [...] "getting funky and pretty soulful". Enrique Lopetegui of The Los Angeles Times said Dreaming of You is Selena's [...] "most electric and satisfying album", and said it was an applicable [...] "epitaph" [...] for her. Lopetegui called the songs on the album [...] "radio-friendly pop tunes" [...] but said the album [...] "lacks cohesion" [...] and that he finds the bilingual album [...] "even more interesting than the original idea". According to Lopetegui, Selena [...] "blossoms into a full-fledged soul singer, with an aggressiveness seldom show before" [...] on her English-language tracks but finds the rancheras [...] "Tú Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "El Toro Relajo" [...] the [...] "most impressive" [...] and saying Selena was inexperienced with that style. Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said Dreaming of You elevated Selena's music [...] "to a far wider audience than she ever had when she was alive". He said the album incorporates her [...] "finest, most enjoyable work" [...] and called it [...] "a commendable but sorrowful accomplishment". Contrasting her Tejano and English-language songs, Farley wrote that Selena's Tejano recordings was sometimes clumsy, whereas her English pop songs were [...] "sweet, pure and clear, and on the mariachi numbers, Selena shows off a voice that is sexy, strong and gracefully maturing".|$|E
