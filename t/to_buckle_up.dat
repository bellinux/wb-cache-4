40|$|Safety belts are {{the most}} {{effective}} safety device in vehicles in terms of preventing injuries (1). Every year, safety belt usage data across the nation is collected by the individual states, the District of Columbia, and U. S. territories in a probability-based observational survey. Using this survey, Massachusetts, a secondary seat belt law state, ranked last in safety belt usage in 2008. This percentage was approximately a 2 percent decrease from 2007. This value was not an aberration as within the recent past, Massachusetts, a secondary safety belt law state, has consistently ranked {{at or near the}} bottom of the 50 states. The foremost issue with safety belt usage is the inherent disregard of the safety related benefits for both drivers and passengers, alike. While there is a significant amount of literature documenting the safety related benefits, there is still a need for continued study of the persistent attributes that are associated with those vehicle occupants who make the decision <b>to</b> not <b>buckle</b> <b>up.</b> The scope of this research encompasses the use of the collected data in the 2009 Massachusetts Safety Belt Usage Observation Study to determine what demographic variables; such as age, gender, race, occupant location, community median income, community population density, community education level, and combined demographics, are at high and low ends of the safety belt usage spectrum. Using this data, along with Massachusetts safety belt usage data from the immediate past observational studies, usage based on these and additional demographic information was quantified and analyzed. An outcome of this research was to identify specific strategies, such as increased education and concentrated enforcement, aimed at increasing safety belt usage amidst those targeted subsections of the population that are not <b>buckling</b> <b>up...</b>|$|R

50|$|In North America, cars sold {{since the}} early 1970s have {{included}} an audiovisual reminder system consisting of a tell-tale light on the dashboard and a buzzer or chime reminding the driver and passengers to fasten their belts.

5000|$|Rotello accepts {{all these}} reasons but argues that {{attempts}} to discover why gay men do not have higher condom compliance asks the wrong question. He {{points out that in}} fact gay men were far more successful promoting condoms than most behavior-change efforts in society at large.“Dieters slip off their diets. Alcoholics fall off the wagon. Former smokers impulsively light up. Responsible drivers sometimes drive drunk, or fail <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> <b>up.</b> Couples desperate not to have a child sometimes fail to use birth control. Failure at compliance is not a specifically “gay” problem, and although failure to be perfect can be exacerbated by contributing factors like lack of education, substance abuse, self-hatred, or survivor’s guilt, such failure is not in its deepest sense caused by those factors, at least not for most people. It seems part of many of our natures to be occasionally impulsive creatures who do not always act in our own genuine long-term best interests. In fact, from the perspective of behavior change, the amazing thing about gay men’s rate of condom use is not that it is so low, but that it is so high. Compared to campaigns that attempt to encourage people to quit smoking, or to diet and exercise, or to quit using addictive drugs, campaigns that often measure success in single percentage points, the consistent adoption of condoms by approximately half of all gay men is a remarkable success by almost any behavioral scale.” ...|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{seat belt}} {{legislation}} varies by state. The state of Wisconsin introduced legislation in 1961 requiring seat belts to be fitted {{to the front}} outboard seat positions of cars. [...] Seat belts have been mandatory equipment since the 1968 model year per Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208. New York State passed the first law in the US mandating the use of seat belts in 1984 {{under the leadership of}} John D. States, an orthopedic surgeon who dedicated his career to improving automotive safety. [...] Depending on which state a driver is in, not wearing a seat belt in the front seat is either a primary offense or a secondary offense, with the exception of New Hampshire, which does not have a law requiring people over age 18 to wear a seat belt. In the front seat, the driver and each passenger must wear a seat belt, one person per belt. In some states, such as New York, New Hampshire, and Michigan, belts in the rear seats are not mandatory for people over the age of 16, though it is extremely advised. The driver and front-seat passengers aged 16 or older can be fined up to $50 each for failure <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> <b>up.</b> In California, you must be 15 years or older to accompany the driver in the front seat. Children 14 and younger must sit in the rear seat until they reach the age of 15. A primary offense means that a police officer can pull a driver over for the seat belt law violation alone, and secondary offense indicates that one can be punished for a seat belt law violation only if they are already pulled over for another reason. By January 2007 25 states and the District of Columbia had primary seat belt laws, 24 had secondary seat belt laws, and New Hampshire had no laws. [...] In 2009, Public Health Law Research published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health.

40|$|Child {{casualties}} in car crashes have decreased over the years. Nevertheless, occupant safety in rear seats, especially for children 4 - 12 years old, needs further attention because motor vehicle crashes remain {{the leading cause}} of death and long-term health consequences for children. The aim of this thesis was to obtain comprehensive knowledge of real-life situations for restrained, forward-facing, rear-seated children aged 4 - 12 years, in frontal car crashes as a basis for vehicle safety improvements to reduce long-term health consequences. The thesis is comprised of four studies based on child-specific data from Sweden and the US. Study I was based on injury data from insurance claim files, covering 2619 injured children in Sweden. Study II was an experimental study of restraint misuse, including 130 Swedish children. Study III analyzed crash data included 27 cases from two US databases, to determine injury causation scenarios. Study IV was a driving study of how pre-crash maneuvers affect child occupant kinematics with 16 children included. The results of Study I emphasized the importance of looking beyond acute, severe injuries and also examine injuries (regardless of initial injury severity) resulting in permanent medical impairment. The vast majority of injuries with the higher degree of permanent medical impairment were severe injuries to the head. The most frequent injuries leading to permanent medical impairment were minor injuries to the neck and head. To reduce the risk of head injuries among children in car crashes, a fundamental step is to ensure that vehicle restraint systems are adapted to the child, physically and behaviorally, and that the child is properly restrained. An experimental study (Study II) of children using integrated booster cushions compared to aftermarket belt positioning booster cushions, showed that misuse related <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> <b>up,</b> a problem for decades, can be reduced to a minimum by the design of an integrated booster cushion. Minimizing misuse will lead to increases in proper positioning of the restraint on the child and may translate to reductions in head injury risk. Therefore, car manufacturers should focus on integrated booster cushions, preferably as standard equipment. Even with proper use, however, restrained children in rear seats sustained head injuries in frontal impacts by impacting their heads on the side interior and on the seat back in front of them. Oblique impacts and pre-crash steering maneuvers contributed to both these injurycausation scenarios (Study III). Therefore, pre-crash steering maneuvers were further explored in a driving study and it was confirmed that these common pre-crash maneuvers can result in an unstable restraint situation that may potentially compromise rear occupant safety in the event of a crash (Study IV). In conclusion, the primary recommendation as a result of this research is to protect the head and neck of child occupants from both minor and severe injuries, since all severity levels of injuries may result in long-term consequences. Frontal impacts, including oblique impacts or maneuvers prior to impact, need to be addressed to develop “tolerant” restraint systems. Furthermore, it is recommendable to design and use vehicle-built-in restraint systems to improve crash safety among children, by facilitating proper use of the restraint and placement on the child, as has been previously done for front-seated adults. To incentivize vehicle manufacturers to accelerate the implementation of child safety improvements within their vehicles, an assessment of child safety for 4 - 12 -year-old children should be included in consumer rating programs and legal requirements...|$|R
