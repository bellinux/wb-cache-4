5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation.

5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So in order <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. <b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> concern, a {{considerable}} amount of LIFE's effort was put into the development of simplified target designs and automated construction that would lower their cost.

It was expected that this would reduce their price to about 25 cents per target, although other references suggest the target price was closer to 50 cents, and LLNL's own estimates range from 20 to 30 cents.|$|E

5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. <b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>this,</b> the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E

5|$|Peasants {{and their}} {{supporters}} advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (approx. four hectares). This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly.
