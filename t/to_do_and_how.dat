Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries.

Visiting females that lack these brown visual marks {{are more likely to be}} accepted into foreign nests. Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these distinctive markings in order to maintain a control system within the nest.|$|E

500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they plan to pay for it."
