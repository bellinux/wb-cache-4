40|$|Oblivious {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the most basic and important building blocks in cryptography. As such, understanding its cost is of prime importance. Beaver (STOC 1996) showed that it is possible to obtain poly(n) oblivious transfers given only n actual oblivious transfer calls and using one-way functions, where n is the security parameter. In addition, he showed that it is impossible to extend oblivious transfer information theoretically. The notion of extending oblivious {{transfer is}} important theoretically (to understand the complexity of computing this primitive) and practically (since oblivious transfers can be expensive and thus extending them using only one-way functions is very attractive). Despite its importance, very little is known about the feasibility of extending oblivious transfer, beyond the fact that it is impossible information theoretically. Specifically, it is not known whether or not one-way functions are actually necessary for extending oblivious transfer, whether or not it is possible to extend oblivious transfers with adaptive security, and whether or not it is possible to extend oblivious transfers when starting with just a few. In this paper, we address these questions and provide almost complete answers to all of them. We show that the existence of any oblivious <b>transfer</b> <b>extension</b> protocol with security for static semihonest adversaries implies one-way functions, that an oblivious <b>transfer</b> <b>extension</b> protocol with adaptive security implies oblivious transfer with static security, and that the existence of an oblivious <b>transfer</b> <b>extension</b> protocol from only O(log n) oblivious transfers implies oblivious transfer itself...|$|R

Selection of the {{requirements}} for the next release of a software product is a inherently complex task due to the high volume of intricate requirements and to the varied interests of the stake holders involved. In this paper we apply integer linear programming techniques to aid requirements managers of product software companies in release planning.

In traditional procedural programming one implements the numerical algorithms in procedures and shuffles data {{in and out of the}} procedures.

Often it is also demanded to modify the inter-procedural data <b>transfer.</b> <b>Extensions</b> to new problems therefore require modifications in the old source code, with an associated possibility of introducing errors.

40|$|Abstract—The market {{penetration}} of access devices with mul-tiple network interfaces {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last few}} years. As a consequence, there is a strong interest to use all of the available interfaces concurrently to improve data throughput. Corresponding extensions of established Transport protocols are receiving considerable attention within research and standardization. Currently two approaches are in the focus of the IETF: The Multipath TCP (MPTCP) extension for TCP and the Concurrent Multipath <b>Transfer</b> <b>extension</b> for SCTP (CMT-SCTP). This paper evaluates and compares implementations of these two loadsharing protocols by using both lab measurements and intercontinental testbed realized via the Internet between Europe and China. The experiments show that some performance critical aspects have not been taken into account in previous studies. Furthermore, they show that the simple scenario with two disjoint paths, which is typically used for evaluation, does not sufficiently cover the real Internet environment. Based on these insights, we highlight that the different path management strategies of the two protocols {{have a significant impact on}} their performance in real Internet scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the growing}} {{interest}} in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has resulted in variety of peerreviewed publications. Significant results in this area have enabled many civilian and industry applications. As more and more vehicles are equipped with multiple network interfaces, how to efficient utilize the coexistence of Radio Access Technologies (RAT) such as WiFi, UMTS and WiMAX to serve a best Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) service is still a challenge in ITS. In this paper, we propose GRA-CMT, a novel Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) based Concurrent Multipath <b>Transfer,</b> <b>extension</b> for Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP). Depending on the advantages of GRA, a GRA-based Data Distribution algorithm is proposed in GRA-CMT to calculate the Grey Relational Coefficient (GRC) value of all candidate paths and offer a more efficient data scheduling algorithm, a further proposed GRA-based CMT Retransmission algorithm devotes to select destination for efficient retransmission. Moreover, the GRA-CMT provides a GRA-based CMT Path Selection scheme to manage candidate paths. Sufficient simulation results obtained by a close realistic simulation topology show how GRA-CMT outperforms existing CMT in heterogeneous SCTP-based vehicular networks...|$|R
