5|$|Donaghy {{called a}} <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> on Rasheed Wallace, then {{playing with the}} Portland Trail Blazers, for {{throwing}} a ball at another official during a game.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left. Michigan was assessed a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship {{due to an}} unforced error by the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|A <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> {{requires}} that the defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
50|$|Rasheed Wallace {{holds the}} record for the most <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> {{received}} during one season in the NBA. In the 2000-01 season, he received 41 <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> in 80 regular season and postseason games played. Wallace also holds the all-time mark for most <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> by a player in a career with 317, a record previously held by Dennis Rodman.|$|R
50|$|Wallace {{was known}} for his {{intensity}} and unique personality, resulting in frequent confrontations with opponents and officials (often leading to <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> and ejections) but also moments of humor. Wallace holds the league records for most career <b>technical</b> <b>fouls,</b> most <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> in a season, and most ejections in a season. During the 2008 Playoffs Wallace went on an expletive-laced tirade following Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics in which he lashed out at the officiating.|$|R
5000|$|In FIBA sanctioned games, {{a player}} is ejected for two {{technicals}} (since October 1, 2014), unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying <b>foul.</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>fouls</b> in FIBA include swinging of elbows without contact and flopping, {{which are not}} fouls in the NBA. A coach can be ejected upon having incurred two coach <b>technical</b> <b>fouls,</b> {{or a combination of}} three bench and coach <b>technical</b> <b>fouls.</b> There is no separation regarding a [...] "non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul," [...] as in the NBA, so two delay of game violations result in an ejection.|$|R
5|$|Smith also instituted the {{practice}} of starting all his team's seniors on the last home {{game of the season}} ("Senior Day") as a way of honoring the contributions of the subs as well as the stars. In a season when the team included six seniors, he put all six on the floor {{at the beginning of the}} game – drawing a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> – rather than leave one of them out.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{faced each other}} {{for the first time since}} the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players Renaldo Balkman and Linas Kleiza began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the {{incident}} was defused after Balkman was given a <b>technical</b> <b>foul.</b> Iverson, Anthony, and Marcus Camby were all removed early in the fourth quarter. Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.|$|E
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 16 <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> were called during Game 2 of the semifinals series between the Alaska Aces and the GlobalPort Batang Pier on January 6, 2016. An in-game scuffle started when Alaska's Calvin Abueva helped to lift Dondon Hontiveros and bumped GlobalPort's Jay Washington who is helping Anthony Semerad to stand up. Team {{officials}} {{from both sides}} tried to pacify the players, including commissioner Chito Narvasa. Alaska was assessed with 8 technicals (Abueva, Hontiveros, Manuel, team manager/governor Dickie Bachmann, head coach Alex Compton, and assistant coaches Louie Alas, Monch Gavieres and Jeffrey Cariaso) while GlobalPort got 5 <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> (Washington, Semerad, team governor Erick Arejola, head coach Pido Jarencio and team manager Bonnie Tan). Three more <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> were called against GlobalPort's Joseph Yeo, Dorian Peña, and Jay Washington on separate plays. The number of <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> for this game tied the record of most number of <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> called in a single game, tying the record set during a game between the Alaska Milkmen and the Shell Turbo Chargers on October 25, 1997.|$|R

50|$|Bandy: A {{yellow card}} {{indicates}} a warning given to an entire team for <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> such as {{errors in the}} execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball. Subsequent <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a white card.|$|R
5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–1997 NBA season, Rodman won {{his sixth}} {{rebounding}} title {{in a row}} with 16.7boards per game, along with 5.7points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, {{he was involved in}} an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000settlement, and the league suspended Rodman for 11games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the 1997 NBA Playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. He struggled to slow down Jazz power forward Karl Malone, but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.|$|E
25|$|Causing a {{backboard}} {{to vibrate}} during a shot or tap is a <b>technical</b> <b>foul.</b>|$|E
50|$|The fines {{accounted}} for <b>technical</b> <b>fouls</b> were doubled {{in an effort}} to reduce excessive complaining.|$|R

25|$|During the Bulls' {{first game}} of the 2007 playoffs against the Miami Heat, Hinrich threw his {{mouthpiece}} into the stands after being assessed a charging foul. Hinrich received a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> for his actions as well as a $25,000 fine.|$|E
25|$|A <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> {{results in}} a blue card on a player where that player must {{substitute}} with another player of the same position. The substitution does not, however, result in a power play for the other team, and play is not stopped when this card is rendered. A play may accrue an unlimited number of technical fouls during a match.|$|E
25|$|Strom ejected Chicago Bulls mascot, Benny the Bull, in {{the third}} game of the 1974 NBA Playoffs series between the Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks. Strom had ejected head coach Dick Motta after {{receiving}} a second <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> for storming onto the court to argue with referee Don Murphy. As Motta left the court, Benny charged onto the court after Murphy and made obscene gestures to both officials, prompting the ejection. It {{is believed to be}} the first time a mascot was thrown out of an NBA game in history.|$|E

25|$|On April 5, 1993, at Michigan's second {{consecutive}} NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game, Webber infamously called a time-out with 11 {{seconds left in}} the game when his team, down 73–71, did not have any remaining, which resulted in a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> that effectively clinched the game for North Carolina. That season, Webber was a first team All-American selection and a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year. These awards and honors have been vacated due to University of Michigan and NCAA sanctions related to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several {{feet away from the}} basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a <b>technical</b> <b>foul.</b> This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} was {{dominated}} by fouls on both sides, and the Americans led at the half 43–35. Late in the half, Cousins was elbowed in the throat by Lithuanian center Jonas Valančiūnas while boxing out for a rebound. Cousins then charged at him without throwing a punch, and received a <b>technical</b> <b>foul.</b> For the second straight game, Harden was scoreless in the first half. He scored the first field goal of the second half, and finished a 10–0 U.S. run with a three pointer that put the team ahead 53–35 in under two minutes. An 18–2 run to start the half was capped by a lob from Irving to Davis for the basket. Team USA made 14 of 19 shots in the quarter to build a 76–49 lead to start the fourth.|$|E

25|$|The Nuggets routed the Hornets in Game 1, led by {{hometown}} player Chauncey Billups's 36 {{points in}} his playoff debut for the Nuggets. He sank a career playoff-high 8 three-pointers and added 8 assists in the game. He continued his form in Game 2, scoring 31 points as the Nuggets took a 2–0 {{lead in the}} series. The Hornets bounced back with a victory in Game 3. Game 3 was marked with plenty of fouls, {{with a total of}} 58 personal fouls in the game, resulting in four players fouling out of the game, David West and Tyson Chandler for the Hornets, and Kenyon Martin and Nenê for the Nuggets. The referees also called three flagrant fouls from James Posey, Chandler and Billups. Hornets' head coach Byron Scott was also called for a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> after arguing on Posey's flagrant foul.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{began the}} 2006 Western Conference Playoffs as {{favorites}} against the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning Game 1 in Phoenix, {{they found themselves}} trailing in the series 3–1 after impressive performances by Laker shooting guard Kobe Bryant. However, the Suns {{went on to win}} three straight games. They won Game 5 easily at home. With 7:33 left in the game, Suns guard Raja Bell grabbed Bryant around the neck and threw him down as the Lakers star drove to the basket. Bell earned a <b>technical</b> <b>foul,</b> his second of the game, and an automatic ejection. The Suns took game 6 in OT, their first OT win all season despite 50 points from Bryant and Bell out serving a one-game suspension (for a flagrant foul against Bryant in Game 5) with last second help from mid-season acquisition Tim Thomas. On their home court, the Suns won Game 7 121–90, eliminating the Lakers {{for the first time since}} 1993. The Suns became only the eighth team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being behind 3–1.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry would {{continue}} into the 2013 NBA Playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls {{in the second}} round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93–87 in game 1. The Heat came back in game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James {{early in the second}} quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers. Noah received a <b>technical</b> <b>foul</b> for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah's neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees.|$|E
