5|$|A {{special unit}} of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, {{to weed out}} {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> as informers. <b>The</b> <b>Stasi</b> regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Heidemann {{was also}} {{released}} from prison in 1987. Five years later it {{was reported in the}} German newspaper Der Spiegel that in the 1950s he had been recruited by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> the East German secret police, to monitor the arrival of American nuclear weapons into West Germany. In 2008 he had debts exceeding €700,000, and was living on social security; his situation had not changed by 2013, and he remained bitter about his treatment.|$|E
5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that}} they were unfit to bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the scale}} and nature of Zersetzung were unknown both to the general {{population}} of the GDR and to people abroad, revelations of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> malicious tactics were met with some degree of disbelief by those affected. Many still nowadays express incomprehension at how <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> collaborators could have participated in such inhuman actions.|$|R

5|$|West German government. After {{a lengthy}} investigation, it was {{determined}} that another negative existed in East Germany and it was used it to make prints that were dubbed in Arabic and distributed in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> or the KGB in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US-backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet-backed Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser).|$|E
5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
25|$|Joachim Wenzel, an {{employee}} of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> the former East German intelligence agency, testified behind screens in week 9. Wenzel {{claimed to have been}} Bollier's handler in the years 1982–85 and testified that Mebo had supplied <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> with timers.|$|E

50|$|Recruitment of {{informants}} {{became increasingly}} difficult {{towards the end}} of the GDR's existence, and, after 1986, there was a negative turnover rate of IMs. This had a significant impact on <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> ability to survey the population, in a period of growing unrest, and knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> activities became more widespread. Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country's economic difficulties becoming a political problem, through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced, but it failed to do so.|$|R

25|$|Before the 2009 presidential election, Gesine Schwan {{was criticized}} by the Federal Commissioner for <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> Records, Marianne Birthler, for {{statements}} on the political regime of East Germany.

25|$|Other {{researchers}} have documented the contribution made from other Warsaw Pact intelligence agencies to the fledgling Sandinista government including <b>the</b> East German <b>Stasi,</b> by using recently declassified documents from Berlin {{as well as}} from former Stasi spymaster Markus Wolf who described <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> assistance in <b>the</b> creation of a secret police force modeled on East Germany's.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, former {{agents of}} the Eastern German secret police, <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> claimed to Greek investigative reporters that during the Cold War, they had orchestrated an {{operation}} of evidence falsification, to present Karamanlis as having planned a coup and thus damage his reputation in an apparent disinformation propaganda campaign.|$|E
25|$|Merkel {{compared}} the NSA to <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> {{when it became}} known that her mobile phone was tapped by that agency.

25|$|In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher {{government}} {{was returned to}} office, but the FDP and the Greens gained {{at the expense of}} the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader Erich Honecker. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting room had been bugged by <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> tapes of the summit had Kohl saying to Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.|$|E
50|$|In the German Democratic Republic, <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> {{who were}} {{established}} in 1950, {{were responsible for the}} control of incoming and outgoing mail and at their height of operations their postal monitoring department controlled about 90,000 pieces of mail daily.|$|R
25|$|In the East, the Soviets crushed dissent {{and imposed}} another police state, often {{employing}} ex-Nazis in <b>the</b> dreaded <b>Stasi.</b> <b>The</b> Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German GNP for reparations, {{while in the}} West reparations were a minor factor.|$|R

25|$|Serov, {{although}} {{generally considered}} less significant than Beria in modern literature, helped to bring Stalinism to Europe and to Stalinise the Soviet Union. Serov's consolidation of Soviet power in Eastern Europe was helped by his organization {{of both the}} Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Polish Intelligence Service) in Poland and <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> in East Germany.|$|E
25|$|Jane and Louise Wilson's work {{together}} includes multiscreen video installations and photo-pieces; their artworks often feature institutional spaces, for example an oil rig, {{the archives of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stasi</b> in East Berlin (the building had previously {{been used by the}} Nazis and Stalin's Russia), The Houses of Parliament, and the Apollo Pavilion in Peterlee designed by Victor Pasmore.|$|E
25|$|All {{information}} acquired worldwide by {{the intelligence}} and security services in the Eastern bloc was stored in the Soviet computer SOUD (System of Joint Acquisition of Enemy Data). The SOUD became a valuable KGB asset for <b>the</b> <b>Stasi.</b> Stasi engineers had actually created the system using stolen and illegally obtained Western technology, but the Soviets insisted that it be based in Moscow.|$|E
5000|$|Members of {{this unit}} {{were part of}} the anti-terrorist {{component}} of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> Guard Regiment [...] "Feliks Dzerzhinsky" [...] and were trained in Erkner on Rügen and in Teupitz. Parachute qualified units of the AGM/S are thought to include 2nd Reconnaissance Company (German: 2. Aufklärungskompanie) and two Stasi airborne agent units at Erkner, associated with the Dynamo Parachute Team at Rote Helene, Leipzig.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Russia's Rossiya {{television}} channel aired {{a documentary on}} Dean Reed, Кто Вы, Мистер Рид? ("Who Are You, Mister Reed?"), speculating on the possibilities of him having been a CIA, KGB or Stasi agent, but failing to present any concrete evidence to support any such theories. It is known, however, that between 1976 and 1978, he did work for <b>the</b> <b>Stasi’s</b> international department.|$|R
5000|$|From 1936 to 1939 Mielke {{served in}} Spain as an {{operative}} of the Servicio de Investigación Militar, the political police of the Second Spanish Republic. While {{attached to the}} staff of future Stasi minister Wilhelm Zaisser, Mielke used the alias Fritz Leissner. Bernd Kaufmann, the director of <b>the</b> <b>Stasi's</b> espionage school later said, [...] "The Soviets trusted Mielke implicitly. He earned his spurs in Spain." ...|$|R
25|$|After German reunification in 1990, it was {{confirmed}} that the RAF had received financial and logistic support from <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> the security and intelligence organization of East Germany, which had given several members shelter and new identities. This was already generally suspected at the time. In 1978 part of the group was exfiltrated through Yugoslavia to communist Poland to avoid manhunt in Germany. Brigitte Mohnhaupt, Peter Boock, Rolf Wagner and Sieglinde Hoffmann spent most of the year in SB facilities in Mazury district, where they were also going through series of trainings along with others from Arab countries.|$|E
25|$|The former East German side Berliner FC Dynamo laid {{claim to}} the three stars of a 10-time champion. They petitioned the league to have their DDR-Oberliga titles recognized, but {{received}} no reply. Dynamo eventually took {{matters into their own}} hands and emblazoned their jerseys with three stars. This caused some debate given what may be the tainted nature of their championships under the patronage of East Germany's secret police, <b>the</b> <b>Stasi.</b> The issue also affects other former East German and pre-Bundesliga champions. In November 2005, the DFB allowed all former champions to display a single star inscribed with the number of titles, including all German men's titles since 1903, women's titles since 1974 and East German titles.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{her studies}} at the University of Leipzig, Merkel sought an {{assistant}} professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree to report on her colleagues to <b>the</b> <b>Stasi,</b> the GDR's secret police. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy. Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, she worked as a researcher and published several papers.|$|E
