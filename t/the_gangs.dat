5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered <b>the</b> <b>gangs,</b> and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often {{erupted into}} gang warfare, and street {{violence}} {{had been on}} the rise in the reign of Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to restore order, when <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian, which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 pm, {{the crowd}} became violent after an {{individual}} threw a bottle off a roof {{into the crowd}} aggregated about the hospital. The group dispersed into gangs containing between 50–100 members. <b>The</b> <b>gangs</b> first broke windows of white businesses as they traveled through Harlem: if the mob was told the business was owned by blacks, they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground. In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000–$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.|$|E
50|$|After {{a couple}} of seconds, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> return and yank Greg from the SUV. Too dazed to react, Greg can only fight to stay {{conscious}} as <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> members savagely beat him. One of them spits on him, laughing. As <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> walks away, Greg reaches out and scratches <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> member who spit on him. <b>The</b> <b>gang</b> deliberately hits Greg's SUV as they drive away in their own vehicle.|$|R
50|$|After hearing gunshots {{near the}} grave Pantoliano dug before losing his memory, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> leader asks Caviezel if <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> leader {{is looking at}} a cop, meaning Caviezel. This sparks a memory that Caviezel was a cop working {{undercover}} in <b>the</b> <b>gang.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> leader looks over to see an empty grave, Kinnear {{comes out of the}} shadows to attack <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> members. Kinnear is killed, as are <b>the</b> remaining <b>gang</b> members. Pepper saves Caviezel's life by shooting <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> leader, who has a gun leveled at Caviezel. The police arrive on the scene. Caviezel is praised for having survived so long undercover.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gang</b> {{attempted}} to rob another train on July 9. Pinkerton detectives had {{learned of the}} plan and ten agents were waiting aboard the train. When <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> broke in, <b>the</b> agents opened fire, wounding two of <b>the</b> <b>gang.</b> Everyone was able to escape except Volney Elliot, who identified {{the other members of}} <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> in exchange for leniency. Using the information, the detectives arrested two more members of <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> (Charlie Roseberry and Theodore Clifton) the next day in Rockport.|$|R
5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive {{in large part because}} of the illegal activities. Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and <b>the</b> <b>gangs,</b> their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Cuba, Castro {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{protests against the}} government’s attempts to raise bus fares, a mode of transport used mostly by students and workers. That year, Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirta’s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to spend in a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirta’s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido Auténticos new candidate, Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell <b>the</b> <b>gangs,</b> but found them too powerful to control.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Trost was {{the costume}} {{designer}} for The FP; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence. She was also {{inspired by the}} fashions of Elvis Presley, and the films Double Dragon, Rocky, Mad Max, The Warriors, 8 Mile, Escape from New York, X-Men, {{as well as the}} works of John Carpenter. Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era. The 245's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army, while the 248's outfits were based on those of the Union Army. The flags of <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty. Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes were made from jumpsuits. The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots. Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores, Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing.|$|E

50|$|A Korean gangster and {{the true}} mastermind behind most of <b>the</b> <b>gang's</b> more underhanded actions. Originally the boss of <b>the</b> <b>gang,</b> he passed {{leadership}} over to Ken as he realized his potential and charisma. He serves as Ken's right hand man, and has numerous underground connections and {{is in charge of}} handling the day-to-day business of <b>the</b> <b>gang.</b> He {{can be seen as the}} real evil behind <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> and is often doing dirty works for <b>the</b> <b>gang,</b> but his loyalty to Ken is unquestionable. He took over <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> after his father was killed. He was put into a coma by Ban-Phuong but later recovers.|$|R
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{fire in the}} Greek {{quarter was}} started by Turkish gangs under their leader Yöruk Ali, once they {{took control of the}} city. <b>The</b> <b>gangs</b> entered the quarter in the morning of 30 June and burnt it down after having looted the houses, killing the occupants. Irrespective of age or sex, a number of Greek inhabitants encountered by <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> as they roamed through the town were ruthlessly killed. Around 2000 or 3000 inhabitants were robbed but not killed. They had managed to take refuge in the French convent before <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> arrived, after which they sought the protection of Colonel Şefik Bey, Commander of the small Ottoman Division present in the city.|$|E
25|$|Having around 8 {{million people}} in the country Honduras has about 7000 gang members, these gangs commit all types of crimes {{possible}} including phone call threats. <b>The</b> <b>gangs</b> also seem {{to have a lot of}} control in the cities with public goods such as taxis and they are very involved. The Honduran government does not have much control against <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> because the government system is not itself very stable. Most of the crime cases are not very well prosecuted and sometimes just discarded, but police enforcement is better on the tourists parts of the city.|$|E
50|$|Gangs can be {{categorized}} based on their ethnic affiliation, their structure, or their membership. Among <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> types defined by <b>the</b> National <b>Gang</b> Intelligence Center are <b>the</b> national street <b>gang,</b> <b>the</b> prison <b>gang,</b> <b>the</b> motorcycle <b>gang,</b> and <b>the</b> local street <b>gang.</b> Other subtypes of gangs include organized crime gangs, youth or juvenile gangs, and ethnic gangs.|$|R

25|$|New Bedford has had thirty unsolved homicides since 2000. Most {{stem from}} the ongoing feuds between gangs of the United Front and Monte Park neighborhoods (projects). <b>The</b> <b>gangs</b> {{are located in the}} south and west ends of the city.|$|E
25|$|Compton {{experienced}} {{a drop in}} homicide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Crime has stabilized overall in the 2010s. The decrease in homicides {{has been attributed to}} various factors, including faster response times by police (reducing shots fired) and better medical care (increasing survival rates). The new mayor elected in 2013 has helped to settle turf wars between <b>the</b> <b>gangs,</b> which has further reduced the homicide rate.|$|E
25|$|The former {{municipal}} president, Luis Sánchez, {{states that}} this kind of activity is waning and claims only two cholo groups are true active gangs. The rest are imitations of the lifestyle as a type of counterculture. He also states that no more than 500 youths belong to <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> which have been identified by the authorities. Other sources state that this is not true and more than 100 groups operate in the city with many more members.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, Doolin formed his own <b>gang,</b> <b>the</b> Wild Bunch. On November 1, 1892, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> {{robbed a}} bank in Spearville, Kansas.

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{physical}} renovation of the property was the community transformation. The first step in this transformation was securing the building from <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> and drug dealers. The new owner installed a state-of-the-art camera system to help deter the rampant criminal activity occurring in the buildings. In a short time, this along with other security measures, helped to eliminate the frequent police visits to the property. Dunbar went from {{being one of the}} most visited properties by the police to a safe and secure community.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality. Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside. Furthermore, many of <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts {{in order for them}} to become further reliant on their exploiters.|$|E

50|$|Tina meets Deepak {{and tells}} him about this. Deepak reveals her the {{remaining}} {{part of the story}} — <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> had one more member, Mahesh Yogi. Mahesh got shot in the crossfire between <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> & <b>the</b> police. Instead of helping him, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> shot him. His bullet ridden body was recovered from the sea & his wallet gave the identities of <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> members.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>gang</b> {{was also}} closely {{associated}} with female outlaws Ann Bassett and Josie Bassett, whose ranch near Browns Park supplied <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> often with fresh horses and beef. Both Bassett girls would become romantically involved with several members of <b>the</b> <b>gang,</b> and both would occasionally accompany <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> {{to one of their}} hideouts, called [...] "Robbers Roost". Associations with ranchers like these in the area allowed <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> considerable mobility, giving them an easy resupply of fresh horses and supplies, and a place to hole up for a night or two.|$|R
25|$|O'Banion's {{murder by}} members of the Chicago Outfit in November 1924 sparked a major gang war in the city. Public opinion finally turned against <b>the</b> <b>gangs,</b> and the number of bombings in Chicago {{declined}} dramatically as extortionists sought more subtle means of intimidating victims. Alterie left Chicago for Colorado (and safety), leaving Shea in charge of the Theatrical Janitors' Union. Unwilling to take sides in the gang war, Shea continued to work as secretary-treasurer and business agent for the union and engaged in low-level extortion for the next five years.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon {{arrived in}} Haiti {{to assess the}} role of the UN forces, announcing that he would visit Cité Soleil during his visit. He said that it was Haiti's largest slum and as such was the most {{important}} target for U.N. peacekeepers in gaining control over the armed gangs. During his visit he announced an extension of the mandate of the UN forces in Haiti. It took MINUSTAH three months and 800 arrests to deal with <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> and lessen the number of kidnappings on the streets.|$|E
25|$|A small police squad {{was sent}} out {{to break up the}} fighting, but upon {{reaching}} Centre Street, <b>the</b> <b>gangs</b> turned against the police, who were forced to retreat after several officers were injured. They made a second attempt, this time fighting their way into the mob, and arrested two men believed to be the leaders. The gangsters responded by storming into the low houses lining The Bowery and Bayard Street, forcing residents out, and climbed to the rooftops, where they proceeded to shower the Metropolitan officers with stones and brick bats until they fled from the area.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, the mob of townspeople {{is getting}} {{closer and closer}} to <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> and Martin.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gang</b> {{consisted}} of five boys - Graham, William, Lux, Robert and Keith - and one girl, Mildred. Plots often {{revolved around the}} boys trying to exclude Mildred, who would often use her influential family to try to force herself back into <b>the</b> <b>gang.</b> Graham's leadership of <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> was constantly threatened by William, whereas Robert and Keith were always {{on the verge of}} fighting. Lux tended to be slow on the uptake, usually a couple of steps behind the rest of <b>the</b> <b>gang's</b> plans. In <b>the</b> second series <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> were joined by a new character, Denise, who was Lux's girlfriend. <b>The</b> <b>gang</b> featured on an episode of Blue Peter just prior to transmission of the first series.|$|R
5000|$|Formed by Rufus Buck, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> {{consisted}} also of Lewis Davis, Sam Sampson, Maoma July, and Lucky Davis. <b>The</b> <b>gang</b> {{began building}} up a small stockpile of weapons while staying in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. After killing U.S. deputy marshal John Garrett on July 30, 1895 <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> began holding up various stores and ranches in the Fort Smith area {{during the next two}} weeks. In one incident a salesman named Callahan [...] - [...] after being robbed [...] - [...] was offered a chance to escape if he could outrun <b>the</b> <b>gang.</b> When <b>the</b> elderly Callahan successfully escaped, <b>the</b> <b>gang</b> killed his assistant in frustration.
