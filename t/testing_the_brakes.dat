40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of active car safety systems on driver‘s behavior in emergency situations, i. e. emergency braking, steering angle, etc. Several models of real vehicles have been tested in order to analyse the ABS and ESP systems operation efficiency. The results of emergency braking and stability in real vehicle testing with ABS and ESP stability control systems switched on and off are presented in detail. In {{order to get the}} maximum impact of ABS and ESP systems (full activated) the real vehicles were tested on the asphalt paved road covered with wet snow. Tests were also carried out on the road sections with different pavement and state. The XL Meter Pro Beta measurement device was used for the real vehicle <b>testing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>brakes</b> and active safety systems of the vehicles have been tested for their effectiveness at different conditions: when the vehicle is braking on horizontal wet asphalt, and on an icy gravel surface, at a different initial running speed: 40 km/h, 70 km/h and 100 km/h. During the real vehicle testing the stability during emergency braking resulted in the assessment of influence of active safety systems on handling the vehicle and its stability, and the driver‘s behaviour in emergency situations i. e. on a slippery road, or at sharp steering angle. The results of real vehicle testing have been presented in the paper in the form of charts. Examination of a vehicle emergency braking and stability systems results in the conclusions concerned with handling of the vehicle ad application of the above systems...|$|E

40|$|A brake {{hardware-in-the-loop}} simulation {{system for}} a railway vehicle provides an effective platform for <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> performance under various dangerous braking conditions. However, in general, four-brake calipers are required to implement a mechanical brake system for one car. In this article, we implement a brake hardware-in-the-loop simulation system only with one brake caliper and three air tanks accounting for hysteresis and pneumatic cylinder dynamics, ultimately saving installation space and reducing financial budget costs. Since <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> caliper has a high nonlinearity, such as hysteresis resulting from friction and from the precompressed spring of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder, we measured the hysteresis of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> caliper clamping force for a mechanical brake system using loadcells, based on which a mathematical model was constructed for the hysteresis of the clamping force between <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pad and <b>the</b> disk.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for <b>testing</b> <b>the</b> air <b>brake</b> systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting <b>the</b> air <b>brake</b> hoses, charging up <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system, setting <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and manually inspecting the cars to ensure <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> are applied, and then releasing <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and manually inspecting the cars to ensure <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of <b>the</b> air <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|R

50|$|On whether braking alone {{may fail}} to stop {{affected}} vehicles, a driver account in the Los Angeles Times claimed that the attempt to stop a 2005 Camry was unsuccessful with both <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and emergency <b>brake.</b> However, <b>tests</b> of <b>the</b> Camry by Car and Driver in 2009, attempting to use <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> to stop acceleration of a purposely stuck throttle at 70, 100, and 120 mph, found that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> driver was able to reduce speed to 10 mph in all instances, and in the 70 and 100 mph <b>tests,</b> stop <b>the</b> car completely. <b>The</b> Camry's <b>braking</b> distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter {{than that of the}} Ford Taurus' regular stopping distance.
