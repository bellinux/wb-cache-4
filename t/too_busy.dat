5|$|At the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August 2008, Moffat {{told how}} he got drunk after the wrap party for Jekyll and pitched {{the idea of a}} Press Gang reunion special to the Head of Drama at the BBC, John Yorke. Despite Yorke's approval, the writer said that he was <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with his work on Doctor Who to pursue the idea.|$|E
5|$|The NBC {{site also}} {{featured}} {{more than two}} minutes-worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, {{in response to his}} recent failed engagement with Angela. Among the deleted scenes are Kevin telling Lynn he will be <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> for three weeks to talk to her and giving a backhanded compliment to her shirt, both at Andy's suggestion.|$|E

Howsoever, my lawful work kept me <b>too</b> <b>busied</b> to {{remember}} him. Body o' me, but I worked that winter upon the gates and the bronzes for the tomb as I'd never worked before! I was leaner than a lath, but I lived--I lived then!' Hal looked at Mr Springett with his wise, crinkled-up eyes, and the old man smiled back.|$|R
5|$|The singing hobo in {{the episode}} was voiced by Hank Azaria. He would {{originally}} be voiced by Jim Carrey, but {{he dropped out}} {{when he found out}} that he was <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to record his lines. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.8million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} <b>too</b> <b>busy.</b> In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were {{not good enough for}} Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, Variety {{reported}} that Paramount Animation, a sister company of Nickelodeon, was starting development of several animated movies, with budgets of around US$100 million. According to Variety, a possible candidate {{for one of}} the films was The Legend of Korra. Series creator Bryan Konietzko later wrote on his blog that no such movie was in development. In July 2013, he said that he and DiMartino were far <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> working on multiple seasons of the TV series in parallel to consider developing a film adaptation at that time.|$|E

When Meera learns that Krish is with Radha, she angrily uploads embarrassing photos of him to Facebook that go viral. Radha learns that Krish spent the night with her on his birthday only two hours after he broke up with Meera, but when she tries to talk to him, he is <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> retaliating against Meera. Frustrated and heartbroken, Radha leaves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1746, Linnaeus was once again {{commissioned}} by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book , published the next year. After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt <b>too</b> <b>busy.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{her first}} really bad stretch of road. She was frightened. Then she was <b>too</b> appallingly <b>busy</b> to be frightened, or to be Miss Claire Boltwood, or to comfort her uneasy father. She had to drive. Her frail graceful arms put into it a vicious vigor that was genius.|$|R
50|$|The {{only member}} of staff who is in any way {{attracted}} to Martin is Karen. She even goes {{as far as to}} write a poem about him.

5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had been <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
5|$|The Torchwood team {{become aware}} of the bizarre death and realises through CCTV that the gas has taken over Carys. Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> working to find time. They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Gibraltar {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, who quickly reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on Gibraltar) to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, hoping they might recover it. But <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed.|$|E

5|$|The {{powerful}} Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan {{was severely}} {{defeated by the}} Christian kings at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. Marinid Morocco subsequently went into internal convulsions, <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> for active intervention in Spain, {{clearing the way for}} a renewed attempt by the Castilians on Algeciras and Gibraltar. Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344. Gibraltar, however, would not fall as easily. The Castilans subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349–50. It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying he was <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon {{to work on that}} film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E

When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.|$|E

Later, while doing his laundry, Will meets his new upstairs neighbor, Val (Molly Shannon). Immediately, the two take a liking to one another. The next day, Will visits Grace at work and introduces Val to her. After the two leave, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Grace's friend and socialite assistant—tells Grace that she did not like the way Will and Val acted towards one another. Grace, however, refuses to accept what Karen implies.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and he had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he felt she was <b>too</b> <b>busy,</b> {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
2500|$|Loneliness, if only as {{representing}} {{a lack of}} communication, is recurrent through Lain.
