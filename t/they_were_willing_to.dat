5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with {{the intervention of the}} International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems {{to ensure that there}} would be no politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept his suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato {{keep an eye on the}} political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola. The betrothal of Stephen III to an unnamed daughter of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Prince of Halych, was also arranged around this time.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed {{as a result of the}} murders and insisted <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E

Ofcom held talks with the other remaining shareholders of the 4 Digital Group to see if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> continue with the launch. In March 2009, Ofcom recommended to the Government that the second national ensemble should be regionalised, formed by the existing regional ensembles.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} robust {{findings}} in experimental analysis in economics is that subjects often display a large discrepancy between the dollar value <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept in order to sell an item (WTA) and the dollar value <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to purchase it (WTP). We suggest that often when individuals face purchase or sale decisions, the actual private value of an object is uncertain. This is significant because, in {{a large number of}} market environments, such uncertainty <b>will</b> cause individuals <b>to</b> display a disparity between WTA and WTP. Our review of the literature confirms that the WTA-WTP disparity does tend to grow where we might expect that estimating an object's value is more difficult. We then turn to our own experiments that attempt to measure such uncertainty more directly and examine how it relates to the WTA-WTP disparity. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a positive relationship. One {{of the most}} robust findings in experimental analysis in economics is that subjects often display a large discrepancy between the dollar value <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept in order to sell an item (WTA) and the dollar value <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to purchase it (WTP). Kahneman et al. (1990) reviewed nearly a dozen studies showing that individuals who have property rights to an item often indicate a minimum selling price that is substantially above that which otherwise identical individuals state is the maximum price <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for the item...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide by drowning; however he {{is now seen as}} a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E

5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> purchase Lympne, {{but the decision}} of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council {{had decided not to}} purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a reasonable price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball {{stated that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> move their training, Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a {{compromise}} {{to free up}} more available time in the arena. This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup. In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration {{of the right to}} lease the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A preliminary injunction for this was granted by Asker and Bærum District Court.|$|E

5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of}} the family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This {{was based on the}} acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went {{on a tour of the}} country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK95.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E

5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, Sims {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics. He {{was one of four}} nonguaranteed {{training}} camp invites (along with Damen Bell-Holter, Kammron Taylor and Chris Babb), vying for the final roster spot after accounting for the 14 guaranteed contracts. He was one of three small forwards invited to camp, along with Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace. On October 26, 2013, he was waived by the Celtics who waived all four nonguaranteed invitees reducing their roster to 14. After waiving the four players, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said all four were welcome to join the team's D-League affiliate, Maine Red Claws, if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept the low paying salary instead of higher paying offers overseas. Sims {{was the only one of}} the four who did not sign with the Red Claws by the end of the month. That year, he went on to sign with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Basketball Super League. In August 2014, he signed with Jeonju KCC Egis of the Korean Basketball League.|$|E
5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss. In 1958, Braathens SAFE had 77,591 passengers.|$|E
