25|$|The 1985 {{campaign}} {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> in the team's history. Seattle went through an alternating pattern of winning two {{games in a row}} and losing two in a row, to end at 8-8. Quarterback Dave Krieg passed for 3,602 yards on the season. A final game loss at home to Denver proved to be a microcosm of the season, as the Seahawks squandered an early lead and then had a potentially game-tying field goal attempt hit the upright as time expired.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the work}} on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were {{probably}} some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past {{as a member of the}} SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.|$|E

25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> in the Lake District. What seems like a direct route is in fact very {{hazardous}} as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.|$|E
25|$|It was to {{take over}} two years between {{the time of the}} {{commission}} from Naples and planned for a production there and its premiere performance at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 17 February 1859. In order to become the Un ballo in maschera which we know today, Verdi's opera (and his libretto) was forced to undergo a significant series of transformations and title changes. Based on the Scribe libretto and begun as Gustavo III set in Sweden, it became Una vendetta in dominò set in Germany, and finally Un ballo, set not in Sweden but in Boston, Massachusetts during the colonial era. These changes were caused by a combination of censorship regulations in both Naples and Rome, {{as well as by the}} political situation in France in January 1858. It became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> experiences of Verdi's career.|$|E
25|$|In the afternoon, Flintoff {{unexpectedly}} removed Justin Langer, who {{had looked}} {{set for a}} century but holed out to Kevin Pietersen at cover point. Ashley Giles, bowling in his first first-class match for twelve months, took the wicket of Damien Martyn but was innocuous, if inexpensive (unlike many of his colleagues), claiming no more wickets during the day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey survived the final session {{of the day to}} close at 3/346. During the session, Ponting passed 100 runs in a near-faultless display, offering up only one potential lbw shout (dismissed by umpire Billy Bowden) when he missed a sweep on a straight ball from Giles. The century took him level with Steve Waugh as Australia's leading century-maker, with 32 centuries each. England's bowling was generally criticised, most notably Harmison, who was given only 12 overs out of the 90 overs bowled during the day. Andrew Flintoff was the only bowler to finish the day with his reputation enhanced, having been England's cheapest and most effective bowler. The pitch, however, was flat and not conducive to either pace or spin bowling and as England failed to use the new ball well at both {{the beginning and end of}} the day, it proved to be one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> days in the field English cricket had endured in modern Ashes series.|$|E

During the first match on tour against the Leeward Islands at Basseterre, Saint Kitts, Hughes suffered from appendicitis and had his appendix removed. The wound became infected and Hughes had to beg team management to be allowed to remain on the tour. Despite his later recovery, he did not play any of the Tests; his personality and attitude to the game did not meet with the approval of the captain, Simpson.

Overall he said that the [...] "first season ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper". Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Being political means considering power {{as part of}} your everyday equations, and there's a lot of power in Europe, and it operates just as ruthlessly, with just as little regard for people and decency, as it does in America. I learned that the process of consolidating a neo-feudal world order is almost as advanced in the old world {{as it is in the}} United States. Music, even hardcore, has its function within this order; it's the neo-feudal choir of resignation. Strap on the headphones and even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrated</b> individual can tolerate that job flipping burgers, washing cars, filing records or painting buildings. There's a lot of good music operating as the soundtrack for a generation with diminished possibilities. Every bit of it ought to be destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Dual {{decomposition}} {{provides a}} tractable framework for designing algorithms for finding <b>the</b> <b>most</b> probable (MAP) configuration in graphical models. However, for many real-world inference problems, the typical decomposition {{has a large}} integrality gap, due to frustrated cycles. One way to tighten the relaxation is to introduce additional constraints that explicitly enforce cycle consistency. Earlier work showed that cluster-pursuit algorithms, which iteratively introduce cycle and other higherorder consistency constraints, allows one to exactly solve many hard inference problems. However, these algorithms explicitly enumerate a candidate set of clusters, limiting them to triplets or other short cycles. We solve the search problem for cycle constraints, giving a nearly linear time algorithm for finding <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrated</b> cycle of arbitrary length. We show how to use this search algorithm together with the dual decomposition framework and clusterpursuit. The new algorithm exactly solves MAP inference problems arising from relational classification and stereo vision. ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Wenger oversaw Arsenal's {{relocation}} to the Emirates Stadium. During the construction phase, he described the move as [...] "vital" [...] to the club's financial future and believed Arsenal were better able to attract the best players. Moving to the new stadium, however, presented several problems in the short term, as the club prioritised financing it over the team. Wenger sold some of his experienced players such as Campbell, Lauren and Pirès, sanctioned Cole's move to Chelsea in part exchange for defender William Gallas, and integrated young players like Theo Walcott and Alex Song into the first team. His youthful team contested the League Cup final in February 2007 and were the youngest {{to play in a}} major English cup final, averaging 21 years. They ultimately came up short against Chelsea, who won the match 2–1. Arsenal finished fourth in the 2006–07 league season; Wenger had ruled out their title chances following defeat to Bolton in November 2006. The team's lack of directness and efficiency of possession was a familiar theme during the campaign; Guardian journalist Daniel Taylor observed two matches into the league season: [...] "The most watchable side are frequently <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating.</b> Arsenal are wonderfully incisive yet infuriatingly blunt." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Verdi, {{his time}} at the Opéra was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrating</b> he had ever experienced. Not only was the librettist, Scribe, unresponsive to his pleas for revisions, until finally, with no premiere in sight and the mysterious {{disappearance}} from rehearsals of Sophie Cruvelli who was to sing Hélène, {{he was forced to}} write to the Opera's director, Louis Crosnier: [...] "To avoid the catastrophe that menaces us... I see but one means and I do not hesitate to propose it: dissolution of the contract". However, with Cruvelli's re-appearance, Verdi persevered for over six months until the opera was finally given its premiere in June 1855, by then having spent close to two years in Paris working on the opera.|$|E

40|$|In {{frustrated}} magnetic systems, geometric constraints or {{the competition}} amongst interactions introduce extremely high degeneracy {{and prevent the}} system from readily selecting a low-temperature ground state. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>frustrated</b> known spin arrangement is on the pyrochlore lattice, but nearly all magnetic pyrochlores have unquenched orbital angular momentum, constraining the spin directions through spin-orbit coupling.
