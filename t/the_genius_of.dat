5|$|Poetical tributes came to Bewick {{even during}} his lifetime. William Wordsworth began his anecdotal poem “The Two Thieves”, {{composed}} in 1798, {{with the line}} “O now that <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> <b>of</b> Bewick were mine”, in which case he would give up writing, he declared.|$|E
5|$|Péladan {{agreed to}} lecture {{in front of}} Societatea Ileana at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was <b>The</b> <b>Genius</b> <b>of</b> the Latin Race. His mystical {{doctrine}} was received with much skepticism and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers. The visit then turned to scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.|$|E
5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. A few disapproved of Delaroche's choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some form, that he sought <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon, to no avail.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game do not reflect <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> <b>of</b> Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in <b>The</b> <b>Genius</b> <b>of</b> Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E

5|$|The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are {{registered}} trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has {{an image of}} Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by <b>the</b> <b>Genius</b> <b>of</b> Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> <b>of</b> the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
