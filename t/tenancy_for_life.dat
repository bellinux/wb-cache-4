Charles sold {{his interest in the}} property to a John McWilliams in 1844, and the latter family took the business over completely when Andrew died six years later. McWilliams' widow in turn sold the building to Clarkson Bird in 1894, beginning a succession of owners that ended in 1936 with the Trimmer family leasing the land. They would buy it outright in 1950. Today Leona Trimmer lives in the house and runs an antique store in the barn.It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and is currently the only property in the town so listed. In 2006 the property was threatened when a developer proposed to use an abandoned town road through part of the land in order to reach a proposed housing development, but so far that has not come to pass.|$|E
