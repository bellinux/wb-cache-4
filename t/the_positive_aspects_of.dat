5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican members on the committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E
5|$|This {{traditional}} approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which focus on <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine culture and legacy. Averil Cameron regards as undeniable the Byzantine {{contribution to the}} formation of the medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries. The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of the classical knowledge, as important contributors to the modern European civilization, and as precursors of both the Renaissance humanism and the Slav Orthodox culture.|$|E

Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Opéra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter. From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for Le Figaro, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> a work.|$|E

However, previous research suggested that such cultural changes have negative associations with interpersonal relationships and happiness for Japanese (Ogihara & Uchida, 2014). In the present research, to demonstrate a negative <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> individualism in Japan, we examined the meaning of individualism which Japanese people hold. Japanese participants aged 16 to 69 reported their evaluation to the word "individualism" and their perception of an "individualistic person. " We found that individualism was regarded as being neutral and ambivalent, including both <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "with independence and freedom" and the negative <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "without <b>positive</b> interpersonal relationships. " In contrast, participants predicted others' evaluation of individualism to be more negative than their own evaluation, since they presumed that others would not consider <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> independence and freedom...|$|R

The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren.

25|$|Among the Indian leaders, Mahatma Gandhi emphatically {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} a united India {{and for a}} while successfully rallied people to this goal. During his meeting with Mountbatten, Gandhi asked Mountbatten to invite Jinnah to form a new Central government, but Mountbatten never uttered a word of Gandhi's ideas to Jinnah. And when Mountbatten's timeline offered the prospect of attaining independence soon, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's inability to deal with the Muslim League and lastly Jinnah's obstinacy, all Indian party leaders (except Gandhi) acquiesced to Jinnah's plan to divide India, which in turn eased Mountbatten's task. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule. His intervention was decisive in persuading {{the vast majority of them}} to see advantages in opting to join the Indian Union. On one hand, the integration of the princely states can be viewed as one of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> his legacy. But on the other, the refusal of Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, and Junagadh to join one of the dominions led to future tension between Pakistan and India.|$|E
