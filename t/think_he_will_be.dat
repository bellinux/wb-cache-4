500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum!" [...] {{said the}} Doctor, {{with an air}} of deep reflection--"I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safest as Louis Kerneguy, keeping himself close beside you"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> happy;--what {{people call}} happy. He is not gifted,--or cursed, {{as it may}} be,--with fine feelings, and is what perhaps may be called thick-skinned; but he will love his own wife and children. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a spendthrift {{now that he has}} plenty to spend, and he is not subject to what the world calls vices. I shouldn't wonder if he becomes a prosperous and most respectable country gentleman, and quite a model to his neighbours." ...|$|E
60|$|The chambermaid <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to manage, if he tucks {{his legs}} up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know him," [...] {{said the}} doctor. [...] "If <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> happier when <b>he's</b> gone away, {{you must be}} happier too, Mrs. Sisson. That's all. Don't let him triumph over you by making you miserable. You enjoy {{yourself}} as well. You're only a girl---" ...|$|R
50|$|Occupation is an outward sign to {{prospective}} purchasers {{that there is}} a lease. If the lessee does not take up occupation when he has an opportunity to do so, he has himself to blame if a purchaser is persuaded to pay the price appropriate for the property which <b>he</b> (the purchaser) <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to occupy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, let her and Emma {{know that}} I am {{sure it is}} not their fault. Come again to-morrow, please; I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} will! But if he did--No, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a staff to guide a silly, priggish heart to the deeper wisdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safe," [...] Ruthven said. [...] "The tide {{will not}} rise high enough {{for there to}} be much danger of his being washed off." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the prison, Evan Henderson (Aaron Douglas) packs up Ray Seward's belongings. He {{talks with}} Francis Becker (Hugh Dillon), {{who appears to}} be {{cleaning}} out his locker. Becker states that he has too much going on at home and has decided to retire and take his pension. He cautions him about becoming a [...] "prisoner" [...] to his job. Henderson <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fine.|$|R
50|$|At that, {{everything}} fits in, as Ivan's {{interview was}} in a prison interrogation chamber; <b>he</b> himself <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> convicted, though anything can happen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mrs. King; I will {{certainly}} try {{to speak to}} him. You said nothing of Alfred; do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> well enough?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He only {{lost his}} {{election}} for Rattleton by ten votes," [...] said Trenchard. [...] "We {{call him the}} Lord Protector, and his friends here <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember me to him," [...] he said. [...] "And {{tell him}} I {{thank him for}} all those years of love and gentleness. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> offended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only that?" [...] said Mary, laughing. [...] "I do {{that every}} night, alone with God; and I do not <b>think</b> <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the farther off for your being here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] he answered, [...] "but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> soon <b>be</b> {{satisfied}} with regarding his stone likeness, and then <b>he</b> <b>will</b> go away." ...|$|R
50|$|Rose {{comes in}} and gets Forbes to come with her to D's embassy, where she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> authenticated. The {{official}} they see, {{a supporter of the}} rebels, claims that D is dead, pulls out a gun and calls the police. They question D about the death of Else, thrown from an upper window of the hotel. Enraged that an innocent girl has been killed, D grabs the gun and, evading pursuit, breaks into an empty flat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wisely done! {{you are one}} of {{the working}} classes, and will enlist I hope in the great {{struggle}} against the drones. The natural friends of the people are younger sons, though they are generally enlisted against us. The more fools they; to devote their energies to the maintenance of a system which is founded on selfishness and which leads to fraud; and of which they are the first victims. But every man <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an exception." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ill? Did he look so?" [...] And as Jean spoke, {{a thrill}} of fear passed over her, lest death should rob {{her of her}} prize.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I shall do {{so later}} in the day, and after {{we have a little}} {{conversation}} I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> so eager to see you in prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I shall do well enough--there'll be Neb; {{and as for}} Rupert, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better {{satisfied}} ashore than at sea. Rupert {{is a sort of}} {{a natural}} lawyer." ...|$|E
50|$|In New York, Soldo {{finds out}} the Torrens family {{will move to}} New York as well. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> rewarded if <b>he</b> brings their {{daughter}} back to him and is determined to make some money. He sends his relatives in Italy a letter they should bring Peppina to him. Bianca responds she doesn't know where Peppina is. Meanwhile, Peppina spots Hugh together with Amy and decides to leave him. In New York, she applies {{for a job in}} Soldo's caf√©.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it goes {{deeper than}} that. I think it's Europe that's turned his {{mind in the}} {{direction}} of reform. At any rate <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> now <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a reformer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> {{has laid}} good ground-work for his alibi," [...] thought Hal. [...] "Well, let him <b>think</b> so, <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{surprised}} before long {{to learn the}} truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|Amelius went on eagerly {{with his}} questions. [...] "What {{sort of man}} is he? Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> prejudiced against me, because I have been brought up in Tadmor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} sitting with one {{who was in the}} same case with yourself," [...] said I, [...] "and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> one of your friends. They called him Robin Oig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God for that, lad; it is {{more than}} I expected. This will be news indeed for the poor women. And do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> strong enough to keep his pledge?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I leave 'im we {{have come}} to an understanding. It is agreed between us that I am to 'ave one last chance. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> not spoil this {{promising}} ship for the 'a'porth of tar. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> give me money for my purpose. But he has said, as we part, if I fail, his 'ands shall be washed of me. He cannot now forget that I am his dear brother's child; but if I fail to accomplish the conquest of the divine Miss Marion, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to.|$|R
5000|$|He {{studied at}} Tokyo University. He is arrogant and enjoys boasting about his [...] "superiority". <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the {{qualified}} detective, often becoming the comic {{relief in the}} series. He is initially in Class A after joining DDS, but later gets demoted to Class B in the manga. He knows Megumi Minami via the Tokyo National Talent Development Research Center and has a crush on Megumi's older sister Akane alongside Kinta in one episode in the anime. Although he has an IQ of 180, he seems too inept in solving mysteries.|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit them, madame, to {{take charge}} of Monsieur de Saint-Eustache. Anatole, you had better order the {{carriage}} for Monsieur le Chevalier. I do not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to ride home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is so, Dick. He has done his duty in keeping your father a prisoner, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> at heart, at all sorry {{that he has made}} his escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|Evelyn smiled. [...] "He keeps some dyking {{plans in}} the hall. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> bored if I join him." [...] She got up languidly. [...] "Since you are not very amusing, I will go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay! Very remarkable. It's mighty low down, all the same," [...] muttered, Ricardo obstinately. [...] "I {{must say}} I {{am glad to}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> paid off for {{it in a way}} that'll {{surprise}} him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give him no heed, Lionel!" [...] said Rosamund. [...] "I shall prove {{him as much}} a boaster as he {{has proved}} himself a villain. Never <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to work his evil will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a good bat, {{but there}} are heaps better in the place. I say, I think I shall give young Farnie the tip once more, and let him {{take it or leave}} it. What do you think?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To a {{man whose}} address I will give you,--a rich man, a great man. I <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to do {{something}} for us. His name is Stirling Deane. I will write his address down for you." ...|$|R
