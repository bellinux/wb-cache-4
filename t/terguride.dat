50|$|<b>Terguride</b> (INN), {{also known}} as trans-dihydrolisuride, is a {{serotonin}} receptor antagonist and dopamine receptor agonist of the ergoline family. It is approved for and used {{in the treatment of}} hyperprolactinemia. <b>Terguride</b> is an oral, potent antagonist of 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A (serotonin) receptors. Serotonin stimulates the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and induces fibrosis in the wall of pulmonary arteries. Together, this causes vascular remodeling and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries. These changes result in increased vascular resistance and PAH. Due to the potential anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic activity of <b>terguride,</b> this potential medicine could offer the hope of achieving reversal of pulmonary artery vascular remodeling and attenuation of disease progression.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>terguride,</b> a partial dopamine agonist, in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). METHODS: In a 12 -week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 99 patients were randomized {{at a ratio of}} 2 to 1 to receive <b>terguride</b> or placebo. Over 21 days, the dosage was titrated to a maximum daily dose of 3 mg of <b>terguride</b> or placebo, and this fixed dosage was continued over 9 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the intensity of pain (100 -mm visual analog scale). Secondary efficacy variables included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score, the tender point score (TPS), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) score. During the study, patients were evaluated for the presence of cervical spine stenosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: No significant differences in the change in pain intensity, FIQ score, TPS, or HDS score between baseline and 12 weeks were observed in the <b>terguride</b> group as compared with the placebo group. Cervical spine stenosis was detected in 22 % of the patients. Only patients with cervical spine stenosis responded to <b>terguride</b> treatment. FIQ scores improved significantly (per-protocol analysis), and pain intensity, the TPS score, and the HDS score showed a trend toward improvement in the <b>terguride</b> group as compared with the placebo group. <b>Terguride</b> treatment was safe. Only those adverse events already known to be side effects of <b>terguride</b> were observed. Premature termination of the study in patients receiving <b>terguride</b> (26 %) occurred predominantly during up-titration {{and in the absence of}} comedication for treatment of nausea. CONCLUSION: <b>Terguride</b> treatment did not improve pain, the FIQ score, the TPS, or the HDS score in the total study population.

Earlier {{studies have indicated that}} <b>terguride,</b> which is a partial dopamine agonist, reduces the prolactin levels that are induced by prolactinemia. Thus, we examined the dose effects of adjunctive treatment with <b>terguride</b> on the plasma concentrations of prolactin in patients with elevated prolactin levels resulting from antipsychotic treatment. <b>Terguride</b> was concomitantly administered to 20  schizophrenic patients (10  males and 10  females) receiving paliperidone and risperidone. The dose of <b>terguride</b> was 1. 0  mg/day. Sample collections for prolactin were conducted before <b>terguride</b> (baseline) and 2 – 4  weeks after administration. The samples were obtained after the morning dose of <b>terguride.</b> The average (± standard deviation) plasma prolactin concentration during <b>terguride</b> coadministration was significantly lower than the baseline concentration in females (82. 3 ± 37. 1  ng/mL versus 56. 5 ± 28. 5  ng/mL, P< 0. 01) but not in males (28. 8 ± 18. 0  ng/mL versus 26. 2 ± 13. 1  ng/mL, not significant). Additionally, a significant correlation between the ratio of prolactin reduction and the baseline prolactin concentration was identified in males (rs=− 0. 638, P< 0. 05) but not in females (rs=− 0. 152, not significant). Many patients complained of various adverse events following <b>terguride</b> administration, such as insomnia, agitation, and/or the aggravation of hallucinations. This study suggests that additional treatment with <b>terguride</b> decreases the prolactin concentrations in females experiencing high prolactin levels as a result of antipsychotic treatment. However, its utility for schizophrenia may be diminished because of its low tolerability. Keywords: hyperprolactinemia, <b>terguride,</b> adjunctive treatment, schizophreni...|$|E
40|$|<b>Terguride,</b> the C 9 - 10 dihydrogenated {{derivative}} of lisuride, {{is a new}} drug which inhibits pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion. It has mixed dopaminergic-antidopaminergic and alpha 2 -antiadrenergic activity, and has proved useful in the clinical management of hyperprolactinemia. However, no trial comparing its use with the standard dopamine agonist bromocriptine has been reported. We have therefore compared three doses of <b>terguride</b> with bromocriptine 2. 5 mg and placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover trial in eight normal volunteers. <b>Terguride</b> showed a potent dose-dependent PRL-inhibiting and growth hormone (GH) -releasing effect, while no significant changes were observed in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or luteinizing hormone (LH) in comparison to placebo. The neuroendocrine profile of <b>terguride</b> 1 mg was identical to that of bromocriptine, with {{a significant reduction in}} PRL still evident at 24 hours.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterised by vasoconstriction and remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature. The serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT)) pathway {{has been shown}} {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of PAH, but pharmacological modulation of this pathway for treatment of PAH is, to date, at a pre-clinical level. <b>Terguride</b> is a 5 -HT receptor (5 -HTR) antagonist that is well tolerated and clinically approved for ovulation disorders. Immunohistochemistry against 5 -HTR 2 A/B on human lungs revealed their localisation to the vascular smooth muscle layer and quantitative RT-PCR showed 5 -HTR 2 B upregulation in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) isolated from PAH patients. Proliferation and migration of cultured primary human PASMC were dose-dependently blocked by <b>terguride.</b> Therapeutic 5 -HT signalling inhibition was 1) demonstrated in isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lungs and 2) by chronic <b>terguride</b> treatment of rats with monocrotaline (MCT) -induced pulmonary hypertension in a preventive or curative approach. <b>Terguride</b> inhibited proliferation of PASMCs and abolished 5 -HT-induced pulmonary vasocon-striction.

40|$|A {{recently}} characterized {{class of}} compounds, dopamine partial agonists, {{have been suggested}} as potential therapeutic candidates for pharmacological intervention in psychostimulant addiction. These drugs bind to dopamine receptors with high affinity and low intrinsic activity and are thought to behave as functional antagonists in conditions of high dopaminergic tone, and as agonists in conditions of low receptor occupancy by dopamine. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterize the effects of <b>terguride,</b> a partial dopamine agonist at the D 2 receptor subtype, on intravenous self-administration of amphetamine in a progressive ratio schedule and to compare it with the effects produced by the dopamine D 2 antagonist eticlopride and the dopamine D 2 full agonist quinpirole. <b>Terguride</b> at the doses of 0. 2 and 0. 4 mg/kg ip significantly decreased the maximum number of responses delivered for a single injection of amphetamine ("breaking point"), an effect similar to that produced by the antagonist eticlopride (0. 01 - 0. 1 mg/kg sc).

Moreover, we evaluated the expression of two Homer 1 a-related genes which play essential roles in synaptic plasticity: mGluR 5 and Homer 1 b. Gene expression was analyzed in brain regions relevant for schizophrenia pathophysiology and therapy, namely the striatum, the cortex, and the hippocampus. In striatum, Homer 1 a was induced by D(2) receptor antagonists and, with a different distribution, by SCH- 23390. In the cortex, Homer 1 a was differentially induced by D(1), D(2), and D(3) receptors antagonists, while haloperidol and <b>terguride</b> did not affect or reduced its expression.

40|$|Background Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) has a poor prognosis and limited responsiveness to available treatments. It is characterised by epithelial cell injury, fibroblast activation and proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) induces fibroblast proliferation via the 5 -HTR 2 A and 5 -HTR 2 B receptors, but its pathophysiological role in IPF remains unclear. A study was undertaken {{to determine the}} expression of 5 -HT receptors in IPF and experimental lung fibrosis and to investigate the effects of therapeutic inhibition of 5 -HTR 2 A/B signalling on lung fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Methods and results Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of 5 -HTR 1 A/B and 5 -HTR 2 B was significantly increased in the lungs of patients with IPF (n = 12) and in those with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP, n = 6) compared with transplant donors (n = 12). The expression of 5 -HTR 2 A was increased specifically in IPF lungs but not in NSIP lungs. While 5 -HTR 2 A protein largely localised to fibroblasts, 5 -HTR 2 B localised to the epithelium. To assess the effects of 5 HTR(2 A/B) inhibition on fibrogenesis in vivo, mice were subjected to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and treated with the 5 -HTR 2 A/B antagonist <b>terguride</b> (or vehicle) in a therapeutic approach (days 14 - 28 after bleomycin).

40|$|The {{isolated}} rat tail artery {{represents an}} in vitro {{model of the}} cutaneous circulation. The aim of the study „Postjunctional α 2 C-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction in rat tail artery: influence of precontraction and temperature on vasoreactivity“ was to characterize the postjunctional α 2 -adrenoceptor in this tissue. In arterial rings UK 14304 elicited only slight contractions which were markedly enhanced after prestimulation with serotonin. Under the condition of elevated vascular tone, the contractile UK 14304 response was competitively antagonised by MK 912, rauwolscine, yohimbine, WB 4101, BRL 44408, ARC 239 and prazosin. Schild regressions were linear and had slopes of unity. Affinities for MK 912, rauwolscine, yohimbine and WB 41104 {{were in the same}} range as binding data for these drugs at α 2 C-adrenoceptors of rat cerebral cortex. In addition, the presence of α 2 C-adrenoceptors was confirmed by Western blotting. After rapid cooling from 37 °C to 27 °C, the maximal UK 14304 response was enhanced only in prestimulated arteries; antagonism by rauwolscine was the same before and after cooling. The enhancement of the maximal UK 14304 response was abolished by rewarming to 37 °C. It is concluded that α 2 C-adrenoceptors predominantly mediate vasoconstriction in rat tail arteries prestimulated with serotonin. An enhanced contractility is detectable in response to cold stimuli. Because α 2 C-adrenoceptors may be involved in Raynaud’s phenomenon, the isolated rat tail artery represents a convenient in vitro bioassay to test novel compounds for the treatment of this syndrome. Enhanced pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to injuries of the central nervous system and physical strain under hypoxic conditions results in pulmonary edema due to increased sympathetic activation. The study „Alpha 2 C-adrenoceptors play a prominent role in sympathetic constriction of porcine pulmonary arteries“ aimed at characterizing α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated responses in porcine pulmonary arteries using a tissue bath protocol. The α 2 -adrenozeptor protein was determined by Western blotting. UK 14304 (α 2 -agonist) elicited only a slight contraction in pulmonary arteries compared to veins. Verapamil (voltage-operated calcium channel blocker), 2 -APB (store-operated calcium channel inhibitor), and P 1075 (KATP channel opener) induced a marked decrease of the basal tone in veins, but not in arteries. It is supposed, that high intracellular calcium levels are a prerequisite for α 2 -adrenozeptor function. Consequently, the UK 14304 -induced contraction in arteries was enhanced by prestimulation with Bay K 8644 (L-type calcium channel activator). Bay K 8644 did not increase the maximal response to noradrenaline (nonselective α-agonist) or phenylephrine (α 1 -agonist). The rightward shift of the concentration–response curve to noradrenaline by prazosin (α 1 -antagonist) in combination with Bay K 8644 was smaller and non-parallel compared to that in the presence of prazosin alone. Therefore, the prerequisite for the α 2 -adrenoceptor activation is fulfilled due to the α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated increase in calcium by noradrenaline itself. UK 14304 responses were inhibited by MK 912 (α 2 C-antagonist) but not by BRL 44408 (α 2 A-antagonist). Affinity of MK 912 and Western blotting analysis argue for an involvement of α 2 C-adrenoceptors in contraction induced by noradrenaline in pulmonary arteries. It is concluded that postjunctional α 2 C-adrenoceptors predominantly mediate contraction in porcine pulmonary arteries and veins. Thus, α 2 C-adrenoceptor antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary edema. Dopaminergic, serotonergic and adrenergic receptors are pharmacological targets for therapeutic actions in schizophrenia. Dopamine D 2 receptor partial agonists such as aripiprazole represent a new treatment option for patients with schizophrenia due to a lower risk to develop extrapyramidal side-effects. The ineffectiveness of <b>terguride,</b> another D 2 receptor partial agonist, in treating schizophrenia was recently attributed to its considerably high intrinsic activity at D 2 receptors. This study aimed at characterizing the effects of <b>terguride,</b> 2 -chloroterguride, 2 -bromoterguride and 2 -iodoterguride at D 2, 5 -HT 2 A, α 2 C-adrenergic, and histamine H 1 receptors using binding and functional assays. Furthermore, we studied the antipsychotic-like effects of 2 -bromoterguride using amphetamine-induced locomotion. Extrapyramidal side-effect liability was evaluated by catalepsy test. As determined by [35 S]GTPγS binding, 2 -chloroterguride, 2 -bromoterguride, and 2 -iodoterguride produced intrinsic activities at D 2 S receptors that were half as high as the intrinsic activity of <b>terguride.</b> The compounds behaved as potent antagonists at D 2 L receptors. They were high-affinity antagonists at 5 -HT 2 A receptors of porcine coronary arteries and α 2 C adrenoceptors of porcine pulmonary arteries. Low affinities of the compounds for H 1 receptors argue against drug-induced weight gain, a specific feature of numerous antipsychotics. In vivo, 2 -bromoterguride inhibited spontaneous behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotion but did not induce catalepsy. Due to their in vitro properties and the promising in vivo antipsychotic-like activity, 2 -chloroterguride, 2 -bromoterguride and 2 -iodoterguride may be strong candidates for the treatment of schizophrenia with a lower risk to induce extrapyramidal side-effects. Serotonin is involved in heart valve tissue fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. The study „Antiserotonergic Properties of <b>Terguride</b> in Blood Vessels, Platelets, and Valvular Interstitial Cells“ aimed at characterizing the antiserotonergic properties of <b>terguride</b> by using functional receptor assays and valvular interstitial cell cultures. <b>Terguride</b> behaved as a potent antagonist at 5 -HT 2 A-receptors and 5 -HT 2 B-receptors. In porcine valvular interstitial cells, serotonin-induced activation of ERK 1 / 2, an initiator of cellular proliferation and activity, was inhibited by <b>terguride</b> as shown by Western blotting. Because of the inhibition of 5 -HT 2 A-receptors, 5 -HT 2 B-receptors and ERK 1 / 2 activity, <b>terguride</b> may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of fibrotic disorders...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the accurate determination of equilibrium constants of complex formation between mandelic acid enantiomers and 1 -allyl <b>terguride.</b> In earlier studies this ergot alkaloid {{has proven to}} be a potential chiral selector for racemic acidic compounds. In these studies, the formation constant was determined by measuring the effective mobility of some racemic acidic analytes at varying concentrations of ergot alkaloid. For these experiments, the assumption was made that the complex mobility was zero. In order to validate these data, the experimental set-up was reversed. In this new set-up, the cationic chiral selector is injected as sample, while the background electrolyte (BGE) contained either of the two optically pure mandelic acid enantiomers, in varying concentrations. For accurate determination of the effective mobility, tetrabutylammonium was used as a mobility reference and the ionic strength of the BGE was kept constant. By performing these experiments at two different pH values, it was possible to determine complex-formation constants, and chiral selectivity towards both the dissociated and the non-dissociated mandelic acid enantiomers. Results show that only the dissociated acid interacts selectively with the ergot alkaloid confirming our earlier results. In our earlier experiments we made the assumption that the non-dissociated acid does not interact with the ergot alkaloid. The experimental data obtained by the current method however, show that, although this interaction is not enantioselective, it cannot be neglected. Optically pure mandelic acid proved to be a suitable chiral selector for the separation of <b>terguride</b> enantiomers...|$|E
40|$|Decreased {{motivation}} {{to work for}} a natural reward is a sign of amphetamine withdrawal and is thought to be associated with hypofunction of the mesolimbic dopamine system. During withdrawal from repeated amphetamine administration, rats showed reduced responding for a sweet solution in a progressive ratio schedule. Repeated systemic treatment with <b>terguride</b> (0. 2 and 0. 4 mg/kg, i. p.) twice daily during the first four days of amphetamine withdrawal reversed the decrease in responding for the sweet solution. These results suggest that dopamine partial agonists, possibly due to their agonistic-like actions under these conditions, are a potential therapeutic approach for the acute withdrawal stage of the amphetamine addition cycle. © 2001 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation and fibrosis. These three main disease-determining pathways are {{the target of}} the currently available treatments used to possibly modify the progression of disease-related manifestations, although this synergy has not been fully applied on SSc joint, skin or lung involvement yet. Areas covered: we describe the current status of SSc treatment/therapy performing a literature search in MEDLINE/Pubmed and Thomson Reuter's Web of Science for articles published until March 2016. Moreover, ongoing registered clinical trials (RCTs) on SSc were searched through clinicaltrials. gov website. Expert commentary: presently, promising drugs are under evaluation to target the different pathogenic pathways of systemic sclerosis: Tocilizumab and Abatacept for skin and lung fibrosis; Riociguat and Selexipag are approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension but promising anti-fibrotic effects are now being studied.

40|$|Abstract: A molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer (MIP) with dual dopamine/serotonin-like binding sites (DS-MIP) was synthesized {{for use as}} a receptor {{model of}} study the druginteraction of biological mixed receptors at a molecular level. The polymer material was produced using methacrylic acid (MAA) and acrylamide (ACM) as functional monomers, N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAA) as cross-linker, methanol/water mixture (4 : 1, v/v) as porogen and a mixture of dopamine (D) and serotonin (S) as templates. The prepared DS-MIP exhibited the greatest rebinding of the template(s) in aqueous methanol solution with decreased recognition in acetonitrile, water and methanol solvent. The binding affinity and binding capacity of DS-MIP with S were found to be higher than those of DS-MIP with D. The selectivity profiles of DS-MIP suggest that the D binding site of DS-MIP has sufficient integrity to discriminate between species of non-optimal functional group orientation, whilst the S binding site of DS-MIP is less selective toward species having structural features and functional group orientations different from S.

40|$|Pergolide, {{lisuride}} and <b>terguride</b> are {{drugs that}} possess a tetracyclic ergoline skeletal structure. The ergoline skeleton shows the structural {{features of the}} monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. This suggests that ergoline derivatives may have affinity for the receptors of the three neurotransmitters. Due to the low receptor specificity and selectivity, ergoline derivatives show {{a wide array of}} action and are therefore considered as being “dirty drugs”. Using such compounds as drugs in men one should await unwanted side effects beside the therapeutic action. Pergolide and lisuride are used in the treatment of Parkinson`s disease. Causing cardiac valvulopathy is a severe side effect of pergolide that is associated with the involvement of 5 -HT 2 B and/or 5 -HT 2 A receptor activation. Performing functional organ bath studies with porcine pulmonary arteries (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 B receptors) and porcine coronary arteries (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 A receptors) the propyl substituent at N(6) of pergolide was identified as the molecular fragment that is responsible for the agonist effects of pergolide at 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 A receptors. Thus the N(6) propyl group is a determinant of cardiac valvulopathy disclosing in cardiac-valve insufficiency and cardiac-valve regur­gitation. Ergoline derivatives partially display high affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors (ARs) which are considered to be the target structures for drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson`s disease and Raynaud`s phenomenon. Due to the lack of convenient in vitro α 2 -AR assays {{that can be used for}} the pharmacological characterisation of (potential) drugs, a new vascular α 2 C-AR assay (viz. the porcine pulmonary vein) was established. For these purposes, the porcine pulmonary vein was investigated in organ bath studies recording the effects of relatively selective α-AR-antagonist on the contractions caused by UK 14304. The results from the Schild- and correlation analysis unambiguously showed that UK 14304 -induced contractions are mediated by a single α 2 -AR subtype. Detection (RT-PCR) and quantification (RTQ-PCR) of mRNA for the α 2 -ARs subtypes in the porcine pulmonary vein revealed the presence and the dominant expression of mRNA for the α 2 C-AR. The postsynaptic α 2 -AR in the porcine pulmonary vein is of the α 2 C-subtype. 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonists are beneficial in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Based on lisuride and <b>terguride</b> (parent compounds), both are antagonists at the two serotonin receptors, structural modified ergoline derivatives were tested using the porcine pulmonary artery (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 7 receptors). Beside the aim to minimise the potential of side effects and to increase the receptor selectivity, structural changes of the parent compounds should also enhance or retain the affinity for both receptors. Some ergoline derivatives were recommended as drug candidates...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a chronic}} mental {{disorder}} which affects about 1 % {{of the population}} worldwide. The antipsychotics (AP) currently available {{have the potential to}} alleviate symptoms, but not all patients respond to drug therapy and the relevant AP do not guarantee an effective (long-term) treatment for all patients. The adverse effects occasionally arising from treatment can jeopardize the success of a treatment, as well. Typical AP mainly act as antagonists at dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 R), and they are thus able to alleviate positive symptoms, and trigger extra-pyramidal adverse effects. There is an ongoing debate if atypical AP can alleviate negative symptoms and cognitive deficits due to their action at various receptors and receptor subtypes (multi target drugs), which would give them clinical superiority. Because of this broad receptor binding profile, metabolic parameters can be altered. Due to the successful preclinical and clinical application of the D 2 R partial agonist aripiprazole, other D 2 R partial agonists may potentially offer a similar, favourable clinical profile. Like aripiprazole, the ergoline 2 -bromoterguride (2 -BT) has been shown in in vitro studies to have a similar affinity to and intrinsic activity at D 2 R. However, compared to aripiprazole, its affinity to serotonergic 5 -HT 2 AR and adrenergic α 2 CR is higher. In general, AP with a (functional) antagonistic activity at these three receptors are {{supposed to be able to}} alleviate all symptoms and deficits of schizophrenia. <b>Terguride,</b> the parent substance of 2 -BT, is a D 2 R partial agonist which has preclinically and clinically been tested but has interestingly only shown an effect against negative symptoms. The in vitro studies mentioned above had also provided evidence of 2 -BT being probably superior to <b>terguride.</b> Therefore, 2 -BT was tested for the first time in in vivo studies, which are basis of the Ph. D. thesis at hand. Firstly, established and predictive tests of preclinical schizophrenia research were run in order to evaluate the antipsychotic potential and the likelihood of triggering adverse effects, which are characteristic for AP. The CAR and AIL test conducted, and the investigation regarding neuronal activity (c-fos) provided substantial evidence in favour of the possible antipsychotic effects of 2 -BT. Furthermore, due to the assessment of acute and prolonged treatment, 2 -BT is unlikely to induce motor adverse effects, a side effect distinctive for typical AP. During prolonged treatment, no alterations in body weight development, body fat proportion and food consumption have been observed. Hence, the metabolic disturbances associated with long-term application are unlikely, as well. Secondly, 2 -BT has been shown affecting behaviour in general and acting in vivo as a functional antagonist at 5 -HT 2 AR. However, its ability to act at the presynaptic D 2 SR could not be determined at all. The antagonism of 2 -BT at the postsynaptic D 2 LR possibly concealed its effect at the D 2 SR. The results gained so far sufficiently prove that 2 -BT may possess antipsychotic potential and causes only negligible adverse effects. Therefore, it is worth conducting further studies on its effect on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits as well as on other adverse effects connected to antipsychotic treatment...|$|E

The binding affinities of DS-MIP were demonstrated in the micro- or submicro-molar range for a series of ergot derivatives, whereas the binding affinities were considerably greater to natural receptors derived from the rat hypothalamus. The DS-MIP afforded the same pattern of differentiation as the natural receptors, i. e. affinity for the clavines > lysergic acid derivatives > ergopeptines. The results suggest that the discrimination for the ergot derivatives by the dopamine and serotonin sites of DS-MIP is due to the structural features and functional orientation of the phenylethylamine and indolylethylamine entities at the binding sites, and the fidelity of the dopamine and serotonin imprinted cavities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the side effect {{mechanisms}} of cabergoline and other ergoline compounds that cause fibrotic changes in heart valves. Heart valve fibrosis occurs during treatment of Parkinson’s disease and may cause regurgitation and even heart failure. To this date, surgical replacement with artificial valves is the only long term treatment option for patients with diseased heart valves. These pathological changes were observed in association with other influences on the serotonergic system such as the use of appetite suppressants like fenfluramine and with the carcinoid syndrome, a tumour disorder causing high serotonin plasma levels. The molecular fragment of pergolide responsible for its agonism at the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors was identified in a previous study by the group of Prof. Pertz. In the initial part of the present study, the pharmacological properties of cabergoline and its derivatives with modified N(6) -substituents were determined both at 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors using functional organ bath assays. It has been shown that the size of the side chain at N(6) in the molecule of cabergoline plays a crucial role for its pharmacological properties at these receptors. Cabergoline and its derivatives with bulky moieties behaved as agonists or high potency partial agonists, whereas derivatives with smaller moieties such as 6 -methylcabergoline led to antagonism with both receptors. 6 -Methylcabergoline retained the desired pharmacological properties at D 2 L und D 2 S receptors relative to cabergoline as shown in a [35 S]GTPγS-binding assay. Further organ bath assays demonstrated that cabergoline or 5 -HT induce contractions in isolated porcine aortic valves. Experiments with selective receptor inhibition were performed in order to determine the 5 -HT-receptor type involved in the contractile effect of cabergoline. The 5 -HT 2 A receptor but not the 5 -HT 1 B or 5 -HT 2 B receptors, was shown to participate in this effect. Cabergoline-induced contraction of aortic valve cusps was reduced in the presence of selective inhibitors of Erk 1 / 2 kinase and Src-tyrosine-kinase, which showed the involvement of both intracellular signalling pathways. It has been demonstrated by others that the contractile effects of 5 -HT lead to functional impairment and changes in the correct geometry of the valves. Thus the present study suggests a participation of the mechanical effects of cabergoline in the pathological mechanism. In the second part of this study, interstitial cells (VICs) were isolated from aortic and mitral porcine valves. VICs are responsible for the production and turnover of the ECM in heart valves. An excessive accumulation of ECM components such as collagen and glycosaminoglycan and high proliferation of VICs are a hallmark pathological feature of fibrosis. As expected when incubated with cabergoline or 5 -HT the biological synthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycan in VICs was increased. The stimulatory effect of cabergoline was concentration-dependent. While some publications dealing with the fibrotic changes induced by serotonin and fenfluaramine point out the involvement of the 5 -HT 2 B receptor, in this research experiments carried out with selective receptor inhibition and activation, indicate that at least the stimulatory effect on the ECM is mediated neither by 5 -HT 1 B nor by 5 -HT 2 B receptor, but by 5 -HT 2 A receptors. However, the blockade of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor failed to induce a total decrease in elevated ECM biosynthesis. This suggests the presence of one or more additional alternative mechanisms of stimulation. The transmission of the signal from the receptor was mediated by activation of the Src-tyrosine kinase during the serotonergic stimulation of the ECM synthesis by 5 -HT. Although 6 -methylcabergoline acted as an antagonist at 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors it showed a stimulatory effect on ECM synthesis. This is in good agreement with the suggestion of one or more additional mechanisms that must be present for the occurrence of heart valve fibrosis given that the effect of 6 -methylcabergoline appeared to be less pronounced compared to cabergoline. Cabergoline increased the phosphorylation of the Erk 1 / 2 kinases in a concentration-dependent manner. The Erk 1 / 2 activation is an early step in fibrosis and was mediated by 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors. The proliferation rate of VICs was increased after incubation with cabergoline or 5 -HT. The addition of an inhibitor of the Erk 1 / 2 activation prevented the increase of the proliferation. This shows that in VICs the mitogenic signaling of serotonin is mediated by Erk 1 / 2 kinases. <b>Terguride</b> is another ergoline compound that has so far not been linked to valvulopathy. This compound was of special interest, as it possesses a methyl substituent at N(6) and an antagonistic activity at the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors. In co-administration studies, <b>terguride</b> was capable of reducing the fibrotic effects of 5 -HT in terms of activation of Erk 1 / 2 kinases and synthesis of collagen. This effect of <b>terguride</b> in VICs also confirmed the hypothesis of a crucial role of the moiety at position 6 in the ergoline skeleton for the pharmacological properties at 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors and thus for fibrotic heart valve disease. In literature, activation of 5 -HT 2 B receptors is considered to be the main cause for drug-induced valvulopathy; nevertheless, the fibrotic potential of 5 -HT 2 A receptor activation has clearly been demonstrated in the present study. Moreover, this study on cabergoline-induced early fibrotic changes in VICs shows that other mechanisms of development of heart valve fibrosis by ergolines may exist...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{is still}} the most {{dangerous}} parasitic infectious disease causing millions of deaths every year. In many countries where Malaria is endemic the traditional medical methods constitute a strong part in the public health care system. Phytochemical research on medicinal plants traditionally used as antimalarials are urgently needed. In this context we looked at several Central American and West African medicinal plants, which are traditionally used against malaria and/or symptoms of the disease. Analysis of all plant species was based on literature and/or ethnobotanical studies. We produced plant extracts of different polarity from various plant parts of eight species from El Slavador and eleven species from Ghana, which are still used in the Central American and West African traditional phytotherapy, All extracts were tested for their in vitro actvity against a Chloroquine-sensitive strain PoW and a Chloroquine-resistent clone Dd 2 of Plasmodium falciparum. The stem bark from Exostema mexicanum Gray (Rubiaceae), the leaves from Calea tenuifolia Kunth (Asteraceae), and the aerial parts from Microglossa pyrifolia (Lam.) Kuntze (Asteraceae) exhibited a promising antiplasmodial activity. Thus bioactivity-guided fractionations were carried out in order to isolate and characterize the major antiprotozoan principles of this species. Further purification of the active lipophilic extract (petrol ether/ methanol 1 : 1) and the methanolic extract of E. mexicanum led to the isolation of seven 4 -phenylcoumarines, with 4 ', 5, 7, 8 -tetramethoxy- 4 -phenylcoumarin [O-methyl-exostemin], 4 ', 8 -dihydroxy- 5, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -phenylcoumarin [exomexin A], and 3 ', 4 '-dihydroxy- 5, 7, 8 -trimethoxy- 4 -phenylcoumarin [exomexin B] as new natural compounds. O-Methyl-exostemin showed a significant activity against P. falciparum (IC 50 -values: 10. 5 µM [PoW] and 4. 7 µM [Dd 2]). Additionally, of all active compounds the cytotoxic effect on the human endothelium cell line (ECV 304) in vitro were assessed. Here, all tested 4 -phenylcoumarines exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity with IC 50 -values between 1, 2 µM and 10, 0 µM. Given this result, the unrestricted use of the E. mexicanum as an ethnomedicinal substance cannot be recommended based. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the lipophilic leaf extract of C. tenuifolia led to the isolation of five flavones and two unsaturated fatty acids. All compounds showed activities against P. falciparum, with 7 -methylacacetin exhibiting the strongest inhibition of the parasite (IC 50 -values: 20. 1 µM [PoW] and 17. 1 µM [Dd 2]). All seven compounds were also tested on the human endothelium cell line (ECV 304). Based on our results, we cannot completely assess the antiplasmodial potential of this plant species. However our findings may represent a rational explanation for a potential antimalarial effect of the leaves of C. tenuifolia. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the aerial parts of M. pyrifolia lead to the isolation of 18 natural compounds, e. g. different furanoditerpenes and geranylgeraniol derivatives. Sinapyl diangelate, 1 -acetyl- 6 E, 10 E, 14 E-geranylgeraniol- 19 -oic acid and 19 -oxo- 6 E, 10 E, 14 E-geranylgeraniol were identified as new natural compounds. The strongest inhibition of P. falciparum could be observed for 2 E- phytol and 6 E, 10 E, 14 E-geranylgeraniol- 19 -oic acid with IC 50 -values ranging from 8. 4 µM [PoW] to 16. 3 µM [Dd 2]. All active compounds showed only a weak cytotoxic effect on ECV 304 with IC 50 -values between 95. 6 µM and 200. 2 µM, or they were not cytotoxic. From several active fractions we isolated 6 E, 10 E, 14 E-geranylgeraniol- 19 -oic acid. This diterpene was also detectable in the aqueous extract despite of its rather lipophilic character. Therefore, we assume that the aliphatic unsaturated compounds are representing the antiprotozoan principle of this species, and 6 E, 10 E, 14 E -geranylgeraniol- 19 -oic acid supposed to be mainly responsible for a moderate antiplasmodial activity of a traditional plant preparation of M. pyrifolia. During another study, the three monomeric ergolines <b>terguride,</b> festuclavine, pergolide, and their N, N'-spacer-linked oligomeric derivatives have been investigated for their in vitro activity against P. falciparum. All monomers have shown only a weak antiplasmodial effect, but either N- 1, N- 1 '- or N- 6, N- 6 '-spacer-linked dimerization are able to enhance their antiparasitic activity. A N- 6, N- 6 ?-spacer-linked depropylpergolide dimer exhibited the highest activities with IC 50 -values of 0. 14 µM and 0. 13 µM against PoW and Dd 2, respectively. Additionally from all tested compounds the cytotoxic effects against mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3 T 3) in vitro were evaluated. For further studies a N- 1, N- 1 '-spacer-linked festuclavine trimer and a N- 1, N- 1 '-spacer-linked <b>terguride</b> tetramer are interesting. Both compounds were not cytotoxic and possessed good aniplasmodial activities with IC 50 -values between 0. 54 µM and 1. 53 µM against Dd 2...|$|E
