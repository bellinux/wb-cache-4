50|$|<b>Tofenacin</b> (INN; Elamol, Tofacine, Tofalin), or <b>tofenacin</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), {{also sometimes}} called mono-N-desmethylorphenadrine, is an antidepressant drug with a tricyclic-like structure which {{was developed and}} marketed in the United Kingdom and Italy in 1971 and 1981, respectively, by Brocades-Stheeman & Pharmacia (now part of Astellas Pharma). It acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and based on its close relation to orphenadrine, may also possess anticholinergic and antihistamine properties. In addition to its use as a pharmaceutical medication, <b>tofenacin</b> is the major active metabolite of orphenadrine and likely {{plays a role in}} its beneficial effects against depressive symptoms seen in Parkinsons disease patients.|$|E
