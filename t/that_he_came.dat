5|$|Baggio has {{close ties}} with Argentina; he speaks Spanish and owns a ranch {{property}} in Rivera, where he enjoys hunting wild game. In March 2008, he gave a lengthy interview with La Gazzetta Dello Sport, in which he revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to support Argentine club Boca Juniors due to their passionate fanbase.|$|E
5|$|His story complete, Tom awakens to find Anne by his side. She {{tells him}} she knew he’d return for his sons. He tells her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> back for her too. Tom then reunites with his {{children}} before greeting fellow members of the 2nd Mass. They appear happy to see him. Pope (Colin Cunningham), however, appears not {{so happy to see}} Tom. He tells Weaver about his suspicions.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} Harald Maddadsson and Rognvald Kali came from Erlend Haraldsson, {{especially}} from Erlend's supporter Frakkok. The old conspirator, however, was soon disposed of, {{burned to death}} in her hall near Helmsdale. The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer, and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Caithness from the south, from Atholl, with Rognvald's blessing and Matad's help. This Svein Asleifsson had also been the man in whose custody Earl Paul had disappeared.|$|E
50|$|WWE star Santino Marella stated at {{his debut}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> from San Fili.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll help you," [...] he said. [...] "Frank shall {{hear every}} word that has passed between us. When <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to-morrow <b>he</b> shall know, beforehand, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to say Good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought his}} Testimony might be wanted--however it happens unluckily <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> to confront Lady Sneerwell {{and not to}} support her-- ...|$|R
5|$|Thomas' name {{suggests}} a strong likelihood <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> from Buittle in Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway, {{lands in the}} control of the Douglas family. In 1388, it was claimed that he had been a scholar of Decrees (i.e. Canon law) at the University of Oxford for five years, a claim to some extent confirmed by the grant of safe-conduct from the English crown on 18 February 1380, to travel and study at Oxford for a year.|$|E
5|$|Brooke-Little {{garnered}} many honours {{and awards}} during his time {{of service to the}} Crown. He was appointed a 4th Class Member of the Royal Victorian Order (an honour now known as Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order) in 1969 for his services at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. This was followed by a promotion to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order at the 1984 New Year Honours Though most Kings of Arms up to that time were knighted, that honour was never given to him. The closest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> was in 1975 when he was made a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, the British revival of the ancient Knights Hospitaller of Saint John.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Holden and Jimmy's {{attorney}} {{were the}} first to congratulate him, and the former insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> home with him to dinner.|$|R
50|$|Repeatedly, {{people ask}} {{him where he}} is from. He points his thumb upwards, which many take to mean <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> from Upper Manhattan.|$|R
5000|$|Alpha Hart（阿力步化哈慈）: No {{one knows}} the real {{identity}} of this controller. Only little information showing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> from a mysterious island in Asia.|$|R
5|$|In May 1923 {{he visited}} {{continental}} Europe, journeying to the museums in Lausanne, Bern and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year {{he became a}} member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, the Institute offered him one of the only archaeological jobs then available in Britain, and he became their librarian, in doing so cementing connections with scholars across Europe. This job meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into contact with many of Britain's archaeologists, of whom there were relatively few during the 1920s; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing the latter's move toward socialism and Marxism.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make money from Frog Fractions, Crawford first sold the game's soundtrack, with part of the {{proceeds}} going to the game's music team. He later decided to sell T-shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team. While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{up with a lot}} of other video game ideas, but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Sasha {{leaves a}} pigeon at the ShadowClan border {{to prove to}} Tigerstar that kittypets can hunt. After {{catching}} a rabbit, Sasha is attacked by two foxes. Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E
50|$|Martin Clunes (Lemon) {{presents}} a spoof animal documentary series {{in which he}} proceeds to wish to 'bum' every animal <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> into contact with.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Party's Over," [...] Danny tells Stella <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> from {{a family}} of cops, though the details of this are left unclear.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well for a tale," [...] Ellen replied, [...] "but you're {{not going to tell}} me <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>come</b> into these ways naturally." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians conquered Anatolia, Maximus {{was forced}} to flee to a monastery near Carthage. It was there <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{under the tutelage of}} Saint Sophronius, and began {{studying}} in detail with him the Christological writings of Gregory of Nazianzus and Dionysius the Areopagite. Maximus continued his career as a theological and spiritual writer while his lengthy stay in Carthage. Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the exarch Gregory, the eparch George and the population as a holy man, ostensibly becoming an influential unofficial political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E

5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|Harris said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up {{with the}} idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which {{had a profound impact on}} him. Ray later said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that boy is as foolish as he seems?" [...] General Sheridan asked his companion. [...] "He admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> of a rebel family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] Mr. Sabin {{continued}} gently, [...] "that {{your advice}} to him--I {{take it for}} granted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to you for advice--was in my favour." ...|$|R

5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> down to posterity.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sihamba," [...] {{said the}} chief Sigwe, [...] "this {{man who was}} found {{wandering}} upon {{the outskirts of the}} town, declares <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is your servant, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to seek you. Is it so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He hath vowed, I believe, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would do}} it, {{if only to}} spite me. And by the time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> to die this accursed Commonwealth will have {{abolished}} all titles and confiscated every estate." ...|$|R
