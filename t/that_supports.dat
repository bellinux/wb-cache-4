50|$|In the mid-to-late 1960s, {{mainframe}} computers, {{such as the}} IBM System/360, had memory sizes from 8 KB to 512 KB. In {{order to}} conserve memory, transients were small modules <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> a specific task, and were swapped {{in and out of}} memory. The operating system for the 360 had two areas reserved for transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> input/output operations. These were referred to as the “logical transient area,” and the “physical transient area.” If an application program, for example, needed to use the printer, transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> printing were brought into the transient areas. If an application needed to use tape drives, transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> tape drive access were brought into the transient areas.|$|R

The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E

5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with {{a consideration of the}} relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory <b>that</b> <b>supports</b> certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E
