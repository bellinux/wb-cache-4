5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
50|$|They {{are slow}} swimmers; they {{commonly}} travel at speeds of 1.5 to 3.2 kph mph {{but have been}} recorded to swim at speeds up to 14 to 22 kph mph. When they surface, <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously, the tail rarely showing before diving. They can also shake their fins, and pull their tail fin and head above the water to observe the environment. They occasionally jump out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, sometimes {{as high as a}} meter (3.14 ft). They are harder to train than most other species of dolphin.|$|R
50|$|The crocodile, missing <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> his <b>snout,</b> <b>the</b> front left leg, and <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> his tail, {{is named}} after Cassius Clay, <b>the</b> birth name <b>of</b> boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|R
50|$|Stephanolepis is a genus of bony fish in {{the family}} Monacanthidae, <b>the</b> filefishes. Members <b>of</b> this genus are unusual-shaped fish and have a very rough skin which gives them their common name. They are {{laterally}} flattened and deep bodied with long dorsal and anal fins and a fan-shaped tail. They have a mouth at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> projecting <b>snout</b> and a long spine on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost {{as wide as}} long, and very thick at the center, giving it a domed appearance. The <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin; the posterior margin of the curtain is strongly fringed and overhangs the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae {{on the floor and}} prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including the curtain, are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
50|$|Cantor's giant {{softshell}} turtle has a broad {{head and}} small eyes close to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> its <b>snout.</b> <b>The</b> carapace {{is smooth and}} olive-colored. Juveniles may have dark-spotted carapaces and heads, with yellow around the carapace.|$|R
50|$|Early stage larvae of Starksia {{are more}} tadpole-shaped than other labrisomids and lack some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melanophores (dark spots) typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. Juvenile Starksia atlantica {{are long and}} narrow, with large eyes. The mouth is at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pointed <b>snout.</b> Both <b>the</b> dorsal and anal fins run {{continuously}} for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. The pectoral fins are long and the pelvic fins have 2 spines and are long and threadlike. The melanophores are few in number and occur at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin rays.|$|R
50|$|The genus is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well {{represented}} aetosaurs from South America, with some specimens being fully articulated. Two rows of dorsal osteoderms run paramedially along either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spine. Ventral osteoderms were also present. Unlike most other aetosaurs, the fourth finger was {{longer than the}} second and third. Additionally, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> phalanges in <b>the</b> fifth digit was lower than other aetosaurs. The upper tooth row of Neoaetosauroides runs anteriorly to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elongated <b>snout,</b> evidence that is incompatible with <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> a keratinous beak proposed for other aetosaurs.|$|R
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> which are {{in contact with the}} internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|Slender and firm-bodied, the quagga {{catshark}} has a {{short and}} flattened {{head with a}} pointed snout. The slightly protruding <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin. The small, horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have rudimentary nictitating membranes; below the eyes are thick ridges, and behind them are tiny spiracles. The rather large mouth is curved, with the upper teeth exposed when closed. There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth. The jaws contain 26–28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are three tooth rows at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and one row at the lower. The teeth have three cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E
5000|$|Longipterygids are {{characterized}} by an extremely long, toothed snout (making up over 60% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total skull length), in which the teeth are restricted to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaws. <b>The</b> <b>snouts</b> were straight but slightly concave at a point behind the nostrils, and <b>the</b> bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> <b>tip</b> were solid. Their pygostyles, <b>the</b> series <b>of</b> fused vertebrae in the tail, were unusually large, and longer than the foot bones. <b>The</b> feet <b>of</b> longipterygids were also specialized relative to other enantiornithines. Where most enantiornithines had a long middle toe with a [...] "knuckle" [...] (trochlea) that extended beyond the outer two, <b>the</b> toes <b>of</b> longipterygids were even in length, and attached to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot at the same level. This configuration is also seen in some groups of modern birds and is usually considered an adaptation for advanced perching ability. It is likely that longipteryigids lived primarily in trees. Because their long jaws tipped with large, often curved teeth are usually considered an adaptation for catching and eating fish, {{it is likely that}} they were similar in ecology to modern Kingfishers.|$|R
50|$|Notoscopelus caudispinosus has a {{laterally}} compressed {{head and}} {{body with a}} maximum length of about 140 mm. The mouth is at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rounded <b>snout</b> and extends backwards to just behind the eye. The teeth are small. There are 24 to 27 soft rays in the dorsal fin, 19 to 21 in the anal fin and 11 to 13 in the pectoral fins. There are groups of photophores (small light organs) {{on the head and}} sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. Above the caudal peduncle there is a row of eight to nine luminous scale-like segments in adult males, but male fish lack luminous organs above the eye and on the cheek. N. caudispinosus differs from closely related species in having fewer than 15 gill rakers.|$|R
50|$|The holotype used to {{describe}} this species is a large laterally compressed skull with its right side exposed. <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> its lower jaw is 111 cm, while its skull is 102 cm long. Its <b>snout</b> is reduced; <b>the</b> skull roof slopes steeply towards <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> its <b>snout.</b> <b>The</b> ratio between <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> its <b>snout</b> to <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> its jaw is lower than that in T. platyodon.|$|R
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
25|$|Ornithischians had paired premaxillary {{bones that}} were toothless and {{roughened}} at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> (presumably {{due to the}} attachment of a keratinous beak).|$|E
25|$|Lingham-Soliar {{reported}} evidence {{of damage to}} the skull and braincase of an immature Mosasaurus hoffmanni. He observed that the area of trauma was similar in size and shape to the bony prow at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> of a Hainosaurus. Lingham-Soliar believed that the larger Hainosaurus rammed the young Moasaurus to death with this snout prow.|$|E
25|$|More so {{than any}} other member <b>of</b> its genus, <b>the</b> {{pectoral}} fin disc <b>of</b> <b>the</b> striped stingaree is oval in shape. The disc is slightly longer than wide, with the anterior margins converging at an obtuse angle on <b>the</b> rounded, non-protruding <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleshy <b>snout.</b> <b>The</b> medium-sized eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular posterior rims. <b>The</b> outer rims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nostrils are enlarged into prominent lobes. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with long fringes on the posterior margin, that overhang the small mouth. There are numerous papillae (nipple-like structures) on the lower jaw, while four tiny papillae are found on <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The small teeth have roughly oval bases. <b>The</b> five pairs <b>of</b> gill slits are short.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Hans C. E. Larsson {{published}} a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner ear and endocranium of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus. Starting from <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain closest to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal's <b>snout</b> is <b>the</b> forebrain, which {{is followed by}} the midbrain. The midbrain is angled downwards at a 45 degree angle and towards <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal. This {{is followed by the}} hind brain, which is roughly parallel to the forebrain and forms a roughly 40 degree angle with the midbrain. Overall, <b>the</b> brain <b>of</b> C. saharicus would have been similar to that of a related dinosaur, Allosaurus fragilis. Larsson found that <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cerebrum to <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain overall in Carcharodontosaurus was typical for a non-avian reptile. Carcharodontosaurus also had a large optic nerve.|$|R
5000|$|D. innominatus males {{grow up to}} 93 cm in pelvic length (PL). [...] PL is {{a measure}} from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals’ <b>snout</b> to <b>the</b> outer margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fins. Contrasting the male, the female smooth skates grow to a larger size of {{approximately}} 112 cm PL. The largest recorded female smooth skate measured in at 158 cm PL. Smooth skates are the largest known skate {{in the world and}} can weigh up to 70 kg at maturity.The smooth skate has a dark grey upper side with darker grey to black spots and an under side that is lighter grey to white in color. Some adults have small prickles or whiskers on their snouts or noses. Smooth skates are commonly mistaken for rough skates but are larger in size and lighter in color.|$|R
25|$|A common {{method to}} {{estimate}} the size of crocodiles and crocodile-like reptiles {{is the use of}} the length of the skull measured in the midline from the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> {{to the back of the}} skull table, since in living crocodilians there is a strong correlation between skull length and total body length in subadult and adult individuals irrespective of their sex, this method is preferred for Sarcosuchus due to the absence of a complete enough skeleton.|$|E
25|$|Unusual among crocodyliforms, Sebecus has a deep, narrow snout. The nares, or nostrils, open {{anteriorly}} at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> While most crocodilians have flat skulls {{that are}} raised near {{the eyes and}} postorbital region behind the eyes, the skull of Sebecus is essentially level. The great depth of the snout makes most {{of the length of}} its upper margin level with the margin of the orbits, or eye sockets. The supratemporal fenestrae, two holes on the skull table, are relatively small.|$|E
25|$|The common stingaree has {{a rounded}} {{pectoral}} fin disc slightly wider than long, with nearly straight anterior margins that converge at a broad angle on the fleshy snout. The <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> may protrude slightly past the disc. The eyes are of medium size and immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular posterior margins. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a broad, flattened lobe. A skirt-shaped curtain of skin is {{found between the}} nostrils, with a strongly fringed posterior margin that overhangs the small mouth. There is a patch of papillae (nipple-shaped structures) on the lower jaw, and 35 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are small with roughly oval bases. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
50|$|Thalattosaurs have {{moderate}} {{adaptations to}} marine lifestyles, including long, paddle-like tails and slender bodies. Primitive features <b>of</b> thalattosaurs include <b>the</b> many teeth covering the palate, single-headed ribs, and broad, plate-like coracoid bones. The most unusual features of thalattosaurs are their snouts. Members <b>of</b> one group, <b>the</b> Askeptosauroidea, have long, narrow, pointed skulls. The extended rostra at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull push back the nostrils {{so that they}} are positioned closer to the eye sockets. Most have small teeth, but one askeptosauroid, Endennasaurus, is entirely toothless. Members of a second group, Thalattosauroidea, have more distinctive downturned snouts. Clarazia and Thalattosaurus both have snouts that taper into a narrow <b>tip.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> is straight, but premaxillae at the tip are downturned. Xinpusaurus also has downturned premaxillae, but <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillae are sharply upturned, forming a notch in the skull. In Hescheleria, Nectosaurus, and Paralonectes, the premaxillae are abruptly downturned at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> nearly forming a right angle with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw. In these forms, <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> is a toothy hook separated from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw by a space called a diastema.|$|R
50|$|Green {{sturgeon}} {{are similar}} in appearance to white sturgeon, except the barbels are closer to the mouth than to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long, narrow <b>snout.</b> <b>The</b> dorsal row <b>of</b> bony plates numbers 8-11, lateral rows, 23-30, and bottom rows, 7-10; there is one large scute behind the dorsal fin as well as behind the anal fin (both lacking in white sturgeon). The scutes {{also tend to be}} sharper and more pointed than in white sturgeon. The dorsal fin has 33-36 rays, the anal fin, 22-28. <b>The</b> body colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white sturgeon is yellow with some pink instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green sturgeon.|$|R
50|$|The Coral Sea stingaree has a {{diamond-shaped}} {{pectoral fin}} disc 113 - 121% wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins and rounded outer corners. <b>The</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleshy, triangular <b>snout</b> protrudes past <b>the</b> disc. The eyes are rather large, and {{are followed by}} teardrop-shaped spiracles with rounded to angular posterior rims. There is a skirt-shaped flap <b>of</b> skin between <b>the</b> nostrils, with a weakly fringed posterior margin whose corners are extended into small lobes. <b>The</b> medium is <b>of</b> medium size and contains 7 - 9 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor; the 5 - 7 papillae in the middle may have multiple tips. The lower jaw also bears a patch <b>of</b> minute papillae. <b>The</b> teeth number 32 - 35 rows in the upper jaw and 30 - 39 in the lower jaw, and are small with roughly rhomboid bases. <b>The</b> five pairs <b>of</b> gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded posteriorly; males have blunt claspers.|$|R
25|$|The head {{is broad}} and depressed, while {{the body is}} {{moderately}} compressed. The dorsal profile rises evenly but not steeply from tip of snout to {{the origin of the}} dorsal fin, then slopes gently ventrally from there to end of caudal peduncle. The ventral profile is horizontal to origin of the anal fin, then slopes dorsally to end of the caudal peduncle. The head is covered with small tubercles with poorly demarcated and indistinct margins, and the body with such tubercles arranged in 56 longitudinal rows on each side. The dorsal fin origin is nearer the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> than caudal flexure. The pectoral spine is stout, with or without serrations on the posterior edge. The caudal fin is weakly emarginate.|$|E
25|$|The blind shark has {{a stocky}} {{body and a}} wide, {{somewhat}} flattened head with a blunt snout. The small, oval eyes are situated high {{on the head and}} have strong ridges underneath; the oval spiracles are positioned behind and below and have obvious raised rims. The nostrils are placed almost at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> and have long, tapering barbels in front and well-developed skin flaps and grooves around the incurrent openings. A pair of obvious grooves connect the nostrils to the small, almost transverse mouth. There are 3234 upper tooth rows and 2129 lower tooth rows; each tooth has an upright, awl-shaped central cusp and a pair of lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fifth pair close to the fourth.|$|E
25|$|The upper jaws {{were lined}} with between 12 and 15 blade-like teeth on each side. The paired premaxillary bone, which formed the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> {{contained}} merely three teeth on each half, less than in most other theropods. Each half of the lower jaw was equipped with 11 to 15 teeth that were slightly straighter and less sturdy {{than those of the}} upper jaw. The tooth crowns of the upper jaw were exceptionally long, measuring up to 9.3cm in length in the largest specimen, which is equal to the minimum height of the lower jaw. In the smaller holotype specimen, the length of the upper tooth crowns (7cm) even surpasses the minimum height of the lower jaw (6.3cm) – in other theropods, this feature is only known from the possibly closely related Genyodectes. In contrast, several members of the related Abelisauridae feature very low tooth crowns.|$|E
5000|$|In {{tune with}} <b>the</b> rhythm <b>of</b> Strauss' waltz, Porky Pig and his unnamed hunting dog are in <b>the</b> presumed woods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title, as Porky, {{in the role}} usually {{reserved}} for Elmer Fudd's rabbit/duck hunter character, holds up the sign [...] "I'm hunting that @!!*@ rabbit!!" [...] (which {{turns out to be}} none other than Bugs Bunny) and the dog holds a sign of his own which simply states [...] "DITTO". Other than <b>the</b> 1930s incarnation <b>of</b> Porky hunting a Bugs Bunny prototype in Ben [...] "Bugs" [...] Hardaway's and Cal Dalton's Porky's Hare Hunt (1938), this is Porky's sole outing as a [...] "rabbit hunter", but since both Porky and Bugs are also bereft here of their familiar voices, <b>the</b> primary motivator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot becomes <b>the</b> expressiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters' [...] "balletic performance". The [...] "@!!*@ rabbit", to <b>the</b> beat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, chomps on his carrots, lifting his foot out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hole to press the pedal to open <b>the</b> lid <b>of</b> his [...] "Rabbit Rubbish" [...] receptacle, tossing carrot stubs in and closing the lid. This alerts Porky's dog, who points to Bugs' hiding hole. Bugs' hands emerge from the hole, holding a book entitled Emily Post Etiquette, then turns to a page that states [...] "It ain't polite to point!" [...] at which he then slams the book shut on the spherical nose at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog's <b>snout.</b> Bugs then emerges from his hole, standing on a theater-style elevated platform, pirouettes out like a ballerina, dance kicks the dog in the face and ties his tail to a tree, making the dog spring back and crash into the flimsy stump, breaking it over his head which knocks him senseless and causes him to burble his lips with his finger like a baby.|$|R
500|$|In 1997, Charig and Milner {{demonstrated}} direct dietary {{evidence in}} <b>the</b> stomach region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B. walkeri holotype. It contained <b>the</b> first evidence <b>of</b> piscivory in a theropod dinosaur, acid-etched scales and teeth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common fish Scheenstia mantelli (then {{classified in the}} genus Lepidotes), and abraded bones of a young Iguanodon. An apparent gastrolith (gizzard stone) was also found. They also presented circumstantial evidence for piscivory, such as crocodile-like adaptations for catching and swallowing prey: long, narrow jaws with their [...] "terminal rosette", {{similar to those of}} a gharial, and the downturned <b>tip</b> and notch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> In their view, these adaptations suggested that Baryonyx would have caught small to medium-sized fish in <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> a crocodilian: gripping them with <b>the</b> notch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> (giving <b>the</b> teeth a [...] "stabbing function"), tilting the head backwards, and swallowing them headfirst. Larger fish would be broken up with the claws. That the teeth in the lower jaw were smaller, more crowded and numerous than those in the upper jaw may have helped the animal grip food. Charig and Milner maintained that Baryonyx would primarily have eaten fish (although it would also have been an active predator and opportunistic scavenger), but it was not equipped to be a macro-predator like Allosaurus. They suggested that Baryonyx mainly used its forelimbs and large claws to catch, kill and tear apart larger prey.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a summary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> sensory receptors in skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, and <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus. Brief mention is also made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third living member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monotremes, the long-nosed echidna, Zaglossus bruijnii. The monotremes are <b>the</b> only group <b>of</b> mammals {{known to have}} evolved electroreception. The structures in the skin responsible for the electric sense {{have been identified as}} sensory mucous glands with an expanded epidermal portion that is innervated by large-diameter nerve fibres. Afferent recordings have shown that in both platypuses and echidnas the receptors excited by cathodal (negative) pulses and inhibited by anodal (positive) pulses. Estimates give a total of 40, 000 mucous sensory glands in the upper and lower bill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platypus, whereas there are only about 100 in <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> echidna <b>snout.</b> Recording <b>of</b> electroreceptor-evoked activity from <b>the</b> brain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platypus have shown that the largest area dedicated to somatosensory input from the bill, S 1, shows alternating rows of mechanosensory and bimodal neurons. The bimodal neurons respond to both electrosensory and mechanical inputs. In skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platypus bill and echidna <b>snout,</b> apart from <b>the</b> electroreceptors, there are structures called push rods, which consist of a column of compacted cells that is able to move relatively independently of adjacent regions <b>of</b> skin. At <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> column are Merkel cell complexes, known to be type I slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, and lamellated corpuscles, probably vibration receptors. It has been speculated that the platypus uses its electric sense to detect the electromyographic activity from moving prey in the water and for obstacle avoidance. Mechanoreceptors signal contact with the prey. For the echidna, a role for the electrosensory system has not yet been established during normal foraging behaviour, although {{it has been shown that}} it is able to detect <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> weak electric fields in water. Perhaps the electric sense is used to detect moving prey in moist soil...|$|R
