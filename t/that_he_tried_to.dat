Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E

Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh.
