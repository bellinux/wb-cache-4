40|$|Abstract. Both {{cysticercosis}} and echinococcosis {{are potentially}} {{among the most}} serious helminth zoonoses threatening human health worldwide. However, {{due to the lack}} of reliable tools for confirmation or identification of patients or infected animals, epidemiological data are expected to be underestimated. Conversely, sometimes, such data are over estimated {{due to the lack of}} specificity. The most important issue for doing field surveys is that they use evidence based science. In this communication, advanced immunological and molecular tools for detection of individuals infected with either metacestodes or adult tapeworms are briefly overviewed, and the applications of such tools for epidemiological surveys in Indonesia, China and other countries are introduced. As immunological tools are based on antigen-antibody responses, there may exist some cross-reactions. Therefore, immunodiagnostic tools are expected to be useful for primary screening, and should be combined with confirmation of direct parasitological evidence (morphology or DNA), and imaging techniques for cysts. As a risk factor for human cysticercosis is the presence of tapeworm carriers, detection of taeniasis cases and differentiation of the three human Taenia species (<b>Taenia</b> solium, T. <b>saginata</b> and T. asiatica) in Asia and the Pacific requires consideration. Similarly, in northwest China, Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis are coendemic and differentiation of these species is required in humans and definitive hosts. It is stressed that combination of several tools for identification of the parasite and for confirmation of diseases is important fo...|$|R
40|$|Taeniasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by tapeworms from the genus Taenia, and infection with the larvae form of Taenia is called Cysticercosis. Some species of Taenia are zoonotic, and humans {{serve as the}} definitive host, the intermediate host or both. Humans are the definitive hosts for <b>Taenia</b> solium, T. <b>saginata</b> and T. asiatica, however, humans also act as an intermediate host for T. solium and T. asiatica. Animals, such as pigs, are the intermediate host for T. solium and T. asiatica, and cattle are the intermediate host for T. saginata. Humans can be infected by taeniasis when they eat beef or pork that contains larvae (cysticercus). While, cysticercosis is transmitted via food or water contaminated with the eggs of Taenia spp. The transmission may also occur by autoinfection {{due to lack of}} hygiene. The diagnosis of taeniasis based on finding the eggs or proglotid in the human feces. For diagnosing cysticercosis in live animals can be done by tongue palpation to find the presence of cysts or nodules. Serological test may also help for diagnosing cysticercosis in humans or animals. Adult tapeworms in the intestine can be killed by anthelmintic and prevention of taeniasis can be conducted by avoiding raw or undercooked pork (T. solium and T. asiatica) and beef (T. saginata). Besides that, to prevent the infection of T. solium, T. saginata or T. asiatica, pigs or cattle should not be exposed to human feces...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{approaches}} {{are now being}} used routinely for accurate identification of Echinococcus and Taenia species, subspecies and strains, and in molecular epidemiological surveys of echinococcosis/taeniasis in different geographical settings and host assemblages. The publication of the complete sequences of the mitochondrial (int) genomes of E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, T solium and Asian Taenia, {{and the availability of}} mtDNA sequences for a number of other taeniid genotypes, has provided additional genetic information {{that can be used for}} more in depth phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of these parasites. This very rich sequence information has provided a solid molecular basis, along with a range of different biological, epidemiological, biochemical and other molecular-genetic criteria, for revising the taxonomy of the genus Echinococcus and for estimating the evolutionary time of divergence of the various taxa. Furthermore, the accumulating genetic data has allowed the development of PCR-based tests for unambiguous identification of Echinococcus eggs in the faeces of definitive hosts and in the environment. Molecular phylogenies derived from mtDNA sequence comparisons of geographically distributed samples of T solium provide molecular evidence for two genotypes, one being restricted to Asia, with the other occurring in Africa and America. Whether the two genetic forms of T solium differ in important phenotypic characteristics remains to be determined. As well, minor DNA sequence differences have been reported between isolates of T <b>saginata</b> and Asian <b>Taenia.</b> There has been considerable discussion over a number of years regarding the taxonomic position of Asian Taenia and whether it should be regarded as a genotype, strain, subspecies or sister species of T saginata. The available molecular genetic data do not support independent species status for Asian <b>Taenia</b> and T <b>saginata.</b> What is in agreement is that both taxa are closely related to each other but distantly related to T solium. This is important in public health terms as it predicts that cysticercosis in humans attributable to Asian Taenia does not occur, because cysticercosis is unknown in T saginata.

5000|$|Taenia is a genus of {{tapeworms}} (a type of helminth) {{that includes}} some important parasites of livestock. Members {{of the genus}} are responsible for taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans, which are a type of helminthiasis belonging {{to the group of}} neglected tropical diseases. More than 100 species are recorded. They are morphologically characterized by a ribbon-like body composed of a series of segments called proglottids; hence the name Taenia (Greek ταίνια, tainia meaning ribbon, bandage, or stripe). The anterior end of the body is the scolex. Not all members of the genus Taenia have an armed scolex (hooks and/or spines located in the [...] "head" [...] region), for example, <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata</b> has an unarmed scolex, while Taenia solium has an armed scolex.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{diagnosis}} is done from a stool sample. Feces are examined to find parasite eggs.

Since {{it is difficult to}} diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata.</b> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between T. saginata, T. solium and T. asiatica. When the uterus is injected with India ink, its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (T. saginata uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as T. solium only have five to 10).|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the defense}} of his {{dissertation}} in chemistry at the University of Paris, he returned to school to study medicine. During his {{last year at the}} Radium Institute, Rossignol had met Raymond Cavier, then Professor of Parasitology at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Paris where he was heading the parasitology laboratory searching for new drugs for the treatment of malaria and intestinal parasites. Cavier had tested some of the compounds Rossignol synthesized for his doctorate degree in chemistry, and he offered Rossignol the opportunity to join his laboratory while continuing his medical education. It would prove to be a good decision, and in 1974 Rossignol and Cavier discovered nitazoxanide, the first of thiazolides. Nitazoxanide was first tested in the Cavier's laboratory and was found effective against both intestinal protozoa and helminths in vitro or in laboratory animals and was first administered in humans in France in the treatment of <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata</b> and Hymenolepsis nana in a small number of patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata</b> (synonym Taeniarhynchus saginata), {{commonly}} known as the beef tapeworm, is a zoonotic tapeworm belonging to the order Cyclophyllidea and genus Taenia. It is an intestinal parasite in humans causing taeniasis (a type of helminthiasis) and cysticercosis in cattle. Cattle are the intermediate hosts, where larval development occurs, while humans are definitive hosts harbouring the adult worms. It is found globally and most prevalently where cattle are raised and beef is consumed. It is relatively common in Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America. Humans are generally infected as a result of eating raw or undercooked beef which contains the infective larvae, called cysticerci. As hermaphrodites, each body segment called proglottid has complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. Thus, reproduction is by self-fertilisation. From humans, embryonated eggs, called oncospheres, are released with faeces and are transmitted to cattle through contaminated fodder. Oncospheres develop inside muscle, liver, and lungs of cattle into infective cysticerci.|$|E
50|$|Taenia asiatica, {{commonly}} known as Asian taenia or Asian tapeworm, is a parasitic tapeworm of humans and pigs. It {{is one of the}} three species of Taenia infecting humans and causes taeniasis. Discovered only in 1980s from Taiwan and other East Asian countries as an unusual species, it is so notoriously similar to <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata,</b> the beef tapeworm, that it was for a time regarded as a slightly different strain. But anomaly arose as the tapeworm is not of cattle origin, but of pigs. Morphological details also showed significant variations, such as presence of rostellar hooks, shorter body, and less number of body segments. The scientific name designated was then Asian T. saginata. But the taxonomic consensus turns out to be that it is a unique species. It was in 1993 that two Korean parasitologists, Keeseon S. Eom and Han Jong Rim, provided the biological bases for classifying it into a separate species. The use of mitochondrial genome sequence and molecular phylogeny in the late 2000s established the taxonomic status.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifecycle}} of tapeworms {{is simple}} {{in the sense}} that no asexual phases occur as in other flatworms, but complicated in that at least one intermediate host is required as well as the definitive host. This lifecycle pattern has been a crucial criterion for assessing evolution among Platyhelminthes. Many tapeworms have a two-phase lifecycle with two types of hosts. The adult <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata</b> lives in the gut of a primate such as a human, but more alarming is Taenia solium, which can form cysts in the human brain. Proglottids leave the body through the anus and fall onto the ground, where they may be eaten with grass by an animal such as a cow. If the tapeworm is compatible with the eating animal, this animal becomes an intermediate host. The juvenile form of the worm enters through the mouth, but then migrates and establishes as a cyst in the intermediate host's body tissues such as muscles, rather than the gut. This can cause more damage to the intermediate host than it does to its definitive host. The parasite completes its lifecycle when the intermediate host passes on the parasite to the definitive host. This is usually done by the definitive host eating a suitably infected intermediate host, e.g., a human eating raw or undercooked meat.|$|E
50|$|Professor Marshall Lightowlers {{began his}} career in the field of {{parasitology}} during a post-doctoral appointment at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide where he undertook research on ovine sarcocystosis. In 1981 he began a post-doctoral position at The University of Melbourne, Veterinary Clinical Centre and began a research career focusing on the immunology and molecular biology of taeniid cestode parasites. His initial research at the University of Melbourne investigated the immunochemistry of antigens of Taenia taeniaeformis and Echinococcus granulosus. Subsequently {{he was a member of}} a team of scientists that developed a vaccine against Taenia ovis infection in sheep, the first recombinant vaccine against a parasitic disease. In 1989 Lightowlers took over leadership of the molecular parasitology research laboratories at the University of Melbourne and began applying the lessons learnt in the T. ovis research to the development of similar vaccines against infection with the larval stages of other cestode parasites. This led to the development of highly effective, recombinant vaccines against cysticercosis in cattle due to <b>Taenia</b> <b>saginata</b> and in pigs due to Taenia solium. In collaboration with Dr David Heath in New Zealand, he and his colleagues also produced a recombinant vaccine against hydatid disease in sheep. This vaccine has proven successful in experimental trials carried out in Argentina, China, New Zealand and Australia and is being manufactured for commercial application. These vaccines remain uniquely effective in the field of parasitology. In 1990 Lightowlers was appointed a Research Fellow of the National Health and Medical Research Council and subsequently promoted to Principal Research Fellow and Professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Melbourne University. He has published more than one hundred articles in internationally refereed journals and books. Recognition of his scientific standing is evident from his numerous invited contributions to national and international scientific meetings and invited review publications and his receipt of substantial, competitive research funding. He had been a member of the World Health Organisation's Informal Working Groups on Echinococcosis since 1988 and is currently coordinator of the group evaluating vaccines. A major feature of Lightowler’s career has been his dedication to training highly successful postgraduate students, staff and sabbatical visitors in the discipline of parasitology. Lightowlers has been an active member of the Australian Society for Parasitology, serving as the society's President in 1995/6, Honorary Secretary, and as a council member representing Victoria. In 1998 the society awarded Lightowlers the Bancroft-Mackerras Medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the science of parasitology.|$|E
