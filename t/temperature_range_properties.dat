Behavior of homogeneous matters at different temperatures is well described {{in theory and}} experimentally verified. Overall effect of all components of mixture and other influences related with material creation affect behaviour and properties of heterogeneous matters. For study of thermal properties can be used transient method of measurement which provide a picture about overall influence of all components of mixture on studied heterogeneous material and among others enable determination of thermophysical properties of whole macroscopic system in observed <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> <b>Properties</b> of solid matters, thin foil and liquids can be measured by means of pulse and step-wise transient method which is used for experimental activity in the thesis. It is contact measurement method and its principle is based on small quantity of heat generating inside the specimen and temperature response measuring. Theoretical part of thesis is focused on creation of method for determination of thermophysical parameters. The base is differential equation of the heat conduction. Its solution is temperature function. Three methods of evaluation are described mathematically.

40|$|Experimental {{conditions}} are studied to optimize transient experiments for estimating temperature dependent thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. Experimental conditions {{refer to the}} test specimen geometry, duration of the experiment, duration of dynamic boundary conditions such as heat flux, and magnitude of boundary conditions. A numerical model of experimental configurations is studied to determine the optimum conditions to conduct the experiment. Conditions for two configurations are studied to quantify the optimal experiment to estimate temperature dependent thermal properties. The two configurations are a finite and semi-infinite test specimen. Both configurations have an applied heat flux on one surface. The finite configuration prescribes an isothermal boundary on the opposite surface. Both configurations can be realized in the laboratory, in particular for low conductivity materials. The criteria D-optimality is used to identify the optimal sensor locations, heating duration and magnitude, and experiment duration. Thermal properties are assumed to vary linearly with temperature; {{a total of four}} parameters describe linearly varying thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. Results indicate that the finite configuration is better than the semi infinite, assuming a single experiment is conducted to estimate the linearly varying properties. An alternative to estimate temperature dependent properties is to combine several experiments. Each individual experiment has a <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> covering {{some or all of the}} <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of the <b>properties.</b> Combining two experiments is studied.
