50|$|Compared to its predecessor, the Siemens-Duewag U2, the SD-160's driver's {{cabin is}} {{significantly}} larger, but its total length is still less than 25 m, allowing three vehicles {{to be combined}} and still be under the 75 m maximum length of a German streetcar <b>train</b> <b>assembly.</b> Each vehicle also features an onboard closed-circuit TV security camera system for increased passenger safety. Unlike the Siemens SD-100, the Siemens SD-160 does not use the bi-folded doors, instead using sliding doors similar to designs featured on the Siemens S70. In addition, both can be used together in mixed trains consisting of SD-100s and SD-160s.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{application}} of virtual simulation within the manufacturing process of a high-speed train. This project was born from a need to reorganize the <b>train</b> <b>assembly</b> line of a rail transport engineering company.

This work focused on improving yard performance by utilizing the concepts of factory physics, Theory of Constraints (TOC) and tools from Lean Manufacturing. The most important manufacturing process analog to improving yard capacity is the bottleneck. In a production system the bottleneck is the process that limits its throughput. As such, the processing rate of the bottleneck sets the rate for the entire system. Improving the performance of the bottleneck {{is the best way to}} improve the performance of the entire terminal process. The <b>train</b> <b>assembly</b> (pull-down) process has been identified as the bottleneck in a majority of classification yards.

40|$|Nineteen Australian safety {{investigation}} reports and 13 UK safety reports were reviewed and a human error identification technique (the Technique for the Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors: TRACEr-rail version) adopted {{as a means}} of identifying and classifying errors associated with rail incidents and accidents. In the Australian sample, it was revealed that most driver errors occurred when drivers were driving or stopping their train and that these errors consistently resulted in two consequences: speeding and signals passed at danger (SPADs). In the UK, errors occurred while drivers were performing a whole range of tasks, including driving, stopping, <b>train</b> <b>assembly,</b> and failed train operations. In Australia, most 'train driving errors' were 'violations' while most 'train stopping errors' were errors of 'perception'. In the UK, a more varied range of errors was observed. Overall, the TRACEr-rail framework proved useful in categorizing driver errors from existing investigation reports and in highlighting recurring errors associated with incidents and accidents. However, the tool appeared to neglect some organizational factors contributing to driver error, and, preliminary inter-rater reliability testing revealed that some category descriptions may require further refinement. Future work will aim to develop a more Australian-friendly and reliable version of TRACEr for use in Australian rail. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe traffic {{evolution}} is notoriously marked by an increasing dynamism that promotes {{the design of}} a dynamic optical layer. Despite the contention issue, Optical Burst Switchingis planned to be deployed in the near future because it offers the required reactivity. Recourse to electrical processing to solve burst contentions has been disregarded because it can dramatically impact the end-to-end delay and the electrical memory requirements. Recently, the CAROBS transmission scheme has been proposed as an adapted response to the drawbacks of translucent architectures: By exploiting both edge and core traffic grooming, CAROBS significantly reduces the contention rate and the duration of the aggregation process. With the additional use of wavelength conversion, loss-less transfer is achieved with similar end-to-end delay and memory requirements as in all-optical OBS networks. The objective in this paper is to attain similar delay and memory performances for loss-less transfers without the support of wavelength converters. We propose a new <b>train</b> <b>assembly</b> process, called CTA, which reduces the time spent in electrical buffers by decreasing the offset times of the trains. The resulting reduction of the buffer occupancy allows the achievement of similar performances as with wavelength conversion, even in congested states, without investing in any specific equipment...|$|E
