500|$|The Suez Canal, {{opened in}} 1869, cut weeks and {{thousands}} of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the <b>time</b> <b>saved</b> at Suez might be crucial. [...] Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, {{though some of the}} stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the Eastern Question of {{what to do about the}} decaying empire governed from Constantinople. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.|$|E

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{opportunity of}} cost is an often overlooked {{cause of the}} rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result {{in an increase in}} demand for a service. Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms {{a major part of the}} total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption. While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. <b>Time</b> <b>saved</b> can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect. [...] Labor <b>time</b> <b>saved</b> at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates. [...] For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, public {{transport}} allowed transport at an {{economy of scale}} not available through private transport. Nowadays there is considerable debate on {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of mass transit. According to the OECD, the advantages of carsharing networks could very well obviate the need for traditional {{public transport}}. Advocates of public transport claim that investing in mass transit will ultimately reduce the total transport cost for the public. <b>Time</b> <b>saved</b> can also be significant, as less cars can translate to less congestion, and faster speeds for remaining motorists.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the dawn}} {{as a social}} science, {{economics}} was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth (1803). These three items are considered by the science only {{in relation to the}} increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say's definition has prevailed up to our <b>time,</b> <b>saved</b> by substituting the word [...] "wealth" [...] for [...] "goods and services" [...] meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science." ...|$|E
