30|$|MPR can be {{realized}} through many techniques, which are classified according to three different perspectives: transmitter, <b>trans-receiver,</b> and receiver (see [17] for details). Among all of them, a promising <b>trans-receiver</b> approach based on random access for different 5 G services is the network-assisted diversity multiple access (NDMA) protocol. NDMA was initially presented in [18] for flat-fading channels and, afterwards, extended to multi-path time-dispersive channels in [19]. The basic idea of NDMA is that the signals received in collided transmissions are stored in memory and then they are combined with future repetitions at the receiver so as to extract all collided packets with a linear detector. In the single-antenna case and under the assumption of perfect reception, NDMA only requires the number of repetitions to be equal {{to the number of}} collided packets [18]. Thus, NDMA dramatically enhances throughput and delay performance as compared to ALOHA-type protocols, but estimation of the number of devices involved in a collision (e.g., P devices) and a properly adjustment of the number of repetitions (i.e. P− 1) is required every time a collision occurs.|$|E

The main principle is that Zigbee {{can be used to}} send and receive data over a wide distance. With the help of zigbee concept we earmark a <b>trans-receiver</b> in a hub and each student is assigned a reader. So with the help of this we sense the objects using a reader and computer. This system consists of Zigbee tag, a reader, and a user-interface computer. These tags are used for STUDENT tagging, asset tracking, access control applications, etc. When the tag is energized by the RF field, it transmits back the contents of its memory by modulating the incoming RF field. The reader detects and demodulates the signal and identifies the tag. For wireless data transmission and networking between sensor nodes, the project uses ZigBee modules. Every node after transmitting waits for an acknowledgment from the server to make data transfer reliable.

40|$|Oil and gas wells are {{cemented}} {{before they}} are put in production. The cement {{is placed in the}} annulus between steel casing and rock formation to provide mechanical integrity and zonal isolation. Evaluating that the cement has indeed displaced drilling mud and has set enough to provide well integrity is a regulatory requirement. The well-honored ultrasonic pulse-echo technique was originally introduced to meet this need. The typical implementation consists of a <b>trans-receiver</b> housed on a fluid-immersed rotating tool to excite a casing thickness resonance whose amplitude decay is sensitive to the acoustic impedance of the annular material in contact with the casing. The technique was however shown to have limitations in (i) resolving light-weight cements with mud-like acoustic impedance as well as in (2) radially probing the entire annular space stemming from the significant impedance contrast encountered by the acoustic beam at the steel layer: less than 10 % of the signal amplitude is coupled to the steel. Investigations to go beyond these limitations led to the identification of the high- frequency casing quasi-Lamb A 0 (aka flexural) mode as having attractive imaging characteristics. The implemented pitch-catch measurement, named flexural wave imaging or FWI, features signals with temporally-compact (i. e., imaging-friendly) echoes: propagating axially in the casing with an amplitude attenuation informing on the material in contact with the steel as well as reflecting from interfaces deep within the cement sheath such as at the rock face, with relatively large amplitudes seemingly defying the impedance contrast premise. This presentation will focus on FWI and will describe the rich and intricate wavephysics arising from the dispersive nature of the flexural mode and that is manifested in particular with the signal propagation in the cement sheath: elastic-wave propagation and evanescence often co-exist, steel-cement bond conditions markedly affect the signal characteristics, and shear only or both compressional and shear wave reflections from the cement-rock interface whose time of flights are explainable in terms of simple ray acoustics whereas their relatively large amplitudes require elaborate scattering (non-specular) considerations. Both theoretical results and processed field data from an operating measurement tool in real wells will be presented to explain and illustrate the intricate wavephysics of FWI as well as comment on the general challenges faced in this industrial application...|$|E

In the front-end <b>trans-receiver</b> of {{a communication}} system, a microwave filter {{is required to}} suppress some unwanted frequencies while pass some of the desired frequencies. One of the filter types is a bandpass filter. There are numerous types of bandpass filter design methods. One of the bandpass filters is a microstrip based parallel coupled line bandpass filter, which offers reasonable matching bandwidth. This thesis presents the investigations results of the wideband microstrip bandpass filters using defected ground structures (DGS). The advantage of DGS is that it improves the matching bandwidth performance of the filter without adding any extended length to the filter design. The proposed bandpass filter using DGS on low loss Roger's substrate ([lower case epsilon][subscript r] = 2. 2, tan [lower case delta] = 0. 0004) is excited using two edge launchers 50 [upper case omega] coaxial probes. The reference parallel coupled bandpass filter shows a fractional bandwidth of 62 % (S 11 [less than] - 10 dB) with the passband frequency range of 2. 9 GHz to 5. 6 GHz and insertion loss better than - 0. 5 dB. Various shapes of defected ground plane structures were investigated and their effect on the filter performance was recorded. In comparison to the reference filter, implementation of DGS with the filter offers an improved passband frequency range of 2. 65 GHz to 5. 75 GHz and insertion loss and reflection coefficient magnitude better than - 0. 3 dB and - 15 dB, which accounts to a fractional bandwidth of 74 %. The effect of employing electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures with the defected ground plane based filter was also studied, which shows a fractional bandwidth of 80 %, the insertion loss and reflection coefficient magnitude are better than - 0. 3 dB and - 15 dB, respectively. So, clearly {{the performance of the}} filter is significantly improved by employing the DGS and EBG structures. This filter was fabricated on a low cost FR- 4 substrate ([lower case epsilon][subscript r] = 4. 5, tan [lower case delta]= 0. 04) while physical dimensions of the filter remained unchanged. The prototype filter??&hibar;s experimental verification was performed using a vector network analyzer. This DGS filter on FR- 4 substrate exhibits an insertion loss, S 21 more than - 3 dB, and reflection coefficient magnitude, S 11 less than - 10 dB with the center frequency of the proposed filter 2. 4 GHz and thereby an operating bandwidth of 64 %. For comparison, the operational bandwidth of the bandpass filter without DGS is only 44 %...|$|E
