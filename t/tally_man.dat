5000|$|The second <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> {{appears at}} the end of Detective Comics #817 as a new {{character}} as part of the One Year Later storyline. He is reimagined as a man of African descent. The <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> shows up at the household of super-villain Orca and kills her husband, Terry Capshaw. <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> then shoots private investigator Jason Bard in the arm as he is reaching for his gun. While holding Bard at gunpoint, he reveals his name to be The <b>Tally</b> <b>Man,</b> then shoots Jason at point blank range. At the same time, however, Bard uses his cane to trip <b>Tally</b> <b>Man,</b> whose shot goes into Bard's arm. A struggle ensues wherein Bard, using his martial arts training, knocks <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> unconscious with a swift kick.|$|E
5000|$|Years later, {{a figure}} {{dressed in the}} strange dark robes of an old-fashioned tax {{collector}} emerges in Gotham City, calling himself the <b>Tally</b> <b>Man.</b> Hired by the underworld to [...] "collect" [...] on debts owed, his fee is not money, but human lives, claiming to have killed sixty-six people since his original victim and priding himself on his 'rationality'. When <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> attempts to collect the [...] "debt" [...] owed by Batman, he battles Azrael, who is standing in for Batman while he recovers from a broken back, mistaking him for the original. Azrael brutally beats and scars <b>Tally</b> <b>Man,</b> leaving him with an even greater hatred for the Dark Knight. <b>Tally</b> <b>Man</b> returns to claim his debt again, only to capture Nightwing (who has taken Azrael's place as Batman), believing the former Boy Wonder {{to be the man}} who had bested him previously. Although he attempts to torment 'Batman' at a game of Russian roulette, threatening to shoot him with a gun with a single bullet in its six chambers while his foe is bound and trapped, this game buys Grayson enough time to escape his bonds by taunting the <b>Tally</b> <b>Man,</b> subsequently defeating his enemy.|$|E

The Russian counterattacked on their right wing and forced a battalion of Karelians on the Swedish left flank to retreat northwards. At this point Adlercreutz ordered the 3rd battalion of Savolax infantry regiment, supported by the 2nd battalion, to counterattack. After a barrage of gunfire, the battalion made a bayonet charge and threw back the Russians.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) After {{the turmoil}} of the 1890 s {{shearing}} contractors eliminated some of the frustration from shearers recruitment. At the same time closer settlement concentrated more sheep in small flocks in farming regions, replacing the huge leasehold pastoral empires which were {{at the cutting edge}} of wool expansion in the nineteenth century. Meanwhile the AWU succeeded in getting an award for the pastoral industry under the new arbitration legislation in 1907. Cultural and administrative influences, therefore, eased some of the bitter enmity which had made the annual shearing so unstable. Not all was plain sailing. A pattern of militancy re-emerged during World War I. Shearing shed unrest persisted throughout the interwar period and during World War II. In the 1930 s a rival union with communist connections, the PWIU, was a major disruptive influence. Militancy was a factor in a major shearing strike in 1956, when the boom conditions of the early- 1950 s were beginning to fade. The economic system did not have satisfactory mechanisms to cope. Unionised shearers continued to be locked in a psyche of confrontation as wool profits eroded further in the 1970 s. This ultimately led to the wide comb dispute, which occurred as wider pressures changed an economic order which had not been seriously challenged since Federation, and which the AWU had been instrumental in shaping. Shearing was always identified with bushworker ‘mateship’, but its larrikinism and irreverence to authority also fostered individualism, and an aggressive ‘moneymaking’ competitive culture. Early in the century, when old blade shearers resented the aggressive pursuit of <b>tallies</b> by fast <b>men</b> engaged by shearing contractors, tensions boiled over. While militants in the 1930 s steered money-makers into collectivist versions of mateship, in the farming regions the culture of self-improvement drew others towards the shearing competitions taking root around agricultural show days. Others formed their own contracting firms and had no interest in confrontation with graziers. Late in the century New Zealanders arrived with combs an inch wider than those that had been standard for 70 years. It was the catalyst for the assertion of meritocracy over democracy, which had ruled since Federation...|$|R
