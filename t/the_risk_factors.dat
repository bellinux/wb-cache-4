5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine.

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for {{endometrial cancer}} involve {{high levels of}} estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E

Methods Allele-specific and a multiplex PCR were employed to identify the genotypes {{of them in a}} case-control study of 210 lung cancer patients and 210 matched controls. Results The CYP 1 A 1 (Val/Val) and GSTM 1 (-) were <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> of lung cancer, the OR was 2. 56 and 1. 89 respectively. <b>The</b> relative <b>risk</b> increased to 2. 6 – fold when the patients carried with two valine alleles in cases of SCC.

5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{prevention}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} is governed at present by <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> model for cardiovascular events, a model which is widely accepted by physicians and professional associations, but which has important limitations: most critically, that effective treatment to reduce arterial damage is often delayed until {{the age at which}} cardiovascular events become common. This delay means that many of the early victims of vascular disease will not be identified in time. This delay also allows atherosclerosis to develop and progress unchecked within the arterial tree with the result that the absolute effectiveness of preventive therapy is limited by the time it is eventually initiated. The causal exposure model of vascular disease is an alternative to <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> model for cardiovascular events. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> model aims to identify and treat those at markedly increased risk of vascular events within the next decade, the causal exposure model of vascular disease aims to prevent events by treating the causes of the disease when they are identified. In <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> model, age is an independent non-modifiable <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> and <b>the</b> predictive power of age far outweighs that of <b>the</b> other <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> In <b>the</b> causal exposure model, age is the duration of time the arterial wall is exposed to the causes of atherosclerosis: apoB (apolipoprotein B) lipoproteins, hypertension, diabetes and smoking.

To estimate the effectiveness of interventions targeted toward high <b>risk</b> groups, <b>the</b> mechanism by which <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> influence <b>the</b> {{natural history of disease}} must be specified. We propose a method for evaluating these <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> assumptions as part of model-building. Methods We used simulation studies to examine <b>the</b> impact of <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> assumptions on <b>the</b> relative rate (RR) of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality for a cohort with a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> compared to a cohort without <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> using an extension of the CRC-SPIN model for colorectal cancer. We also compared the impact of changing age at initiation of screening colonoscopy for different risk mechanisms. Results Across CRC-specific <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> mechanisms, <b>the</b> RR of CRC incidence and mortality decreased (towards one) with increasing age. The rate of change in RRs across age groups depended on both <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> mechanism and <b>the</b> strength of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> effect. Increased non-CRC mortality attenuated the effect of CRC-specific <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> on <b>the</b> RR of CRC when both were present.
