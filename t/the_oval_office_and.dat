David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> <b>and</b> warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the saucers are positioned.|$|E
25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> <b>and</b> on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} ready for review and {{presentation}} to Congressional leaders when Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. A few days after President Kennedy's funeral, President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Jacqueline Kennedy in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> <b>and</b> asked {{what he could do}} for her. Mrs. Kennedy requested two things: That Cape Canaveral be renamed for her husband, and that the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan move forward. Word of the request leaked to the public, and Johnson publicly supported the area's redevelopment on October 24, 1964. Johnson subsequently approved the establishment of a Temporary President's Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue (composed of Cabinet members, federal planners, architects, and others) to move the plan forward, although it did not hold its first meeting until May 21, 1965. The Temporary Commission's goal was to push for a permanent body with the legal authority to engage in condemnation and force public and private bodies to conform to its plans. Before the Temporary Commission was named, District of Columbia officials agreed to abandon plans to build an office building west of the District Building, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to reorient its planned headquarters more squarely with Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E

While comics were expected to tell jokes about the administration, the 2006 dinner was held at a time when the relationship between the administration and the media was under great strain, and the administration was sensitive to criticism. Attorney and columnist Julie Hilden concluded that Colbert's [...] "vituperative parody" [...] might have been unfair under different circumstances, but noted that Bush's record of controlling bad press created a heightened justification for people to criticize him when they got the chance. Media Matters [...] and Editor & Publisher came to Colbert's defense, calling his detractors hypocrites. They contrasted the critical reaction to Colbert to the praise that many in the press had for a controversial routine that Bush performed at a similar media dinner in 2004, where Bush was shown looking for WMDs in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> <b>and</b> joking, [...] "Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere!"

In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure; this will be followed with additional renovation of the wing.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{sought to}} {{increase}} his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson [...] "general supervision" [...] over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to [...] "cooperate fully {{with the vice president}} in the carrying out of these assignments." [...] Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to [...] "review" [...] national security policies instead. Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> <b>and</b> to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House. His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend Sarah T.

House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.|$|E

25|$|Theodore Roosevelt hired {{architect}} Charles Follen McKim {{to reorganize}} the layout {{and use of}} the White House. This included constructing the West Wing in 1902 <b>and</b> moving executive <b>offices</b> out of the central White House. The original structure, some of which is still extant in the present West Wing, was originally intended to be temporary. With some modifications by William Howard Taft the West Wing remained largely unchanged until a fire on December 24, 1929 during the administration of Herbert Hoover. Because of the recent stock market crash, Hoover chose only to repair rather than expand. In 1933, early in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, the president began a series of meetings with staff architect Eric Gugler to enlarge and modify the West Wing. Roosevelt moved Taft's <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> centered on <b>the</b> south side of the wing, to its present location in the southeast corner adjacent to the Rose Garden. This made moving to and from the Executive Residence to <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> quicker, <b>and</b> allowed for more privacy, a concern in concealing FDR's paralysis.|$|R
