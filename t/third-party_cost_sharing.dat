40|$|Under a contract, {{agents are}} not only held to honor the {{allocation}} as prescribed by a <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanism but also a full description of allocated units and costs once production falls short. For agents leaving the <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem by taking their demanded units and prepaying the corresponding bill, a contract allows for a reformulation of the <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem to serve the remaining agents. Consistency requires invariance of <b>cost</b> <b>shares</b> relative to any such reduced <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> problem.

The {{problem of}} <b>sharing</b> the <b>cost</b> {{of a common}} {{infrastructure}} among a set of strategic and cooperating players {{has been the subject}} of intensive research in recent years. However, most of these studies consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an offline setting, i. e., the mechanism knows all players and their respective input data in advance. In this paper, we consider cooperative <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games in an online setting: Upon the arrival of a new player, the mechanism has to take instantaneous and irreversible decisions without any knowledge about players that arrive in the future. We propose an online model for general demand <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> games and give a complete characterization of both weakly group-strategyproof and group-strategyproof online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms for this model. Moreover, we present a simple method to derive incremental online <b>cost</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms from online algorithms such that the competitive ratio is preserved.

This same group practice also served an equally large number of patients covered by United Steelworkers' health benefit plans, for which similar utilization data were available. The questions addressed in this interinsurer study are: (1) to what extent does a physician's treatment of medically similar cases vary, following a drop in patient visits {{as a result of}} <b>cost</b> <b>sharing?</b> and (2) what is the impact, if any, on costs of care for other patients in the practice (e. g., "spillover effects" such as cost shifting) ?

A fixed-effects model of physician service use was applied to data on episodes of treatment for all patients in a private group practice.
