5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Baroque palazzi {{continued}} in private ownership throughout the 19th century, {{as the old}} aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt. There were a few exceptions {{and some of these}} retain the ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The I-351-class {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} under the 5th Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942 to support IJN flying boats {{in areas where}} there were no shore facilities and seaplane tenders could not operate. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to support up to three flying boats with fuel, ammunition, water and even replacement aircrew.|$|E

5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious was {{the lead}} ship of the s built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> as second-class ironclads {{suitable}} for use on foreign stations and the ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station. She was decommissioned in 1894 and hulked in 1902 {{for use as a}} training ship. The ship was towed to Scapa Flow after the beginning of the First World War {{to be used as a}} receiving ship and then to Rosyth after the war ended. Audacious was sold for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

50|$|Alvin Plantinga {{offers another}} theory of {{knowledge}} {{closely related to}} virtue epistemology. According to him, knowledge is warranted if one's intellectual faculties <b>are</b> operating as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to. That <b>is,</b> knowledge is valid if it is obtained through the correct operation of the faculties of the intellect which <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> to have an inherent ability, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> that way, to capture and produce true beliefs.|$|R

5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed,</b> causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to {{manoeuvre}} the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> {{to escort}} the US fleet of fast attack {{aircraft}} carriers, the Iowa-class battleships were all intended {{to carry a}} fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40mm mounts and 49 single 20mm mounts. In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20mm and 40mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20mm and 40mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E

5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters long at the waterline, and 183 meters long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 17 meters and a draft of 5.42 meters standard, 7.25 meters forward, and 6.03 meters aft. The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were smaller than their contemporaries due to {{limitations}} imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> {{under the supervision of}} Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, the namesake of the lead ship, and Benedetto Brin. Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers.|$|E

5|$|The gardens {{surrounding}} the museum cover about 100 hectares. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by the French landscape architect and botanist Édouard André (1840–1911) {{and his son}} Rene Eduard Andre, assisted by the Belgian gardener Buyssen de Coulon. Local historians have estimated that they originally contained about 500 varieties of trees and shrubs, some brought from gardens in Berlin. About 250 imported and 370 native plant species are now represented at the park; 24 of these are included in Lithuania's 1992 list of endangered species. Pine and fir trees adapted to the sandy soil predominate.|$|E

5|$|The two Brummer class cruisers were {{designed}} in 1914, when the turbines being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available {{owing to the}} state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of their need for high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E
