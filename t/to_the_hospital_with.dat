5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able {{to hold back the}} crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks.

The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the storage buildings. People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others.

5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her.

30|$|Both joint {{outpatient}} {{clinics and}} special outpatient clinics {{have their own}} advantages. For example, as for the team evaluation in joint outpatient clinics, every suspected case of child with developmental delay can seek consultation from 3 doctors. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that parents can get a relatively comprehensive evaluation without traveling between <b>hospitals</b> and home. <b>The</b> advantages of special outpatient clinics is that they are available everywhere, and that might reduce <b>the</b> waiting time <b>to</b> receive evaluation. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>with</b> insufficient resources, this can be an appropriate approach.|$|R
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool.

Six others in the room survived and were rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>with</b> severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E
