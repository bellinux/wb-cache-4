40|$|ABSTRACT Many of {{the pulp}} mill {{biorefinery}} concepts recently presented includes removal of lignin from black liquor. In this work, {{the aim was}} to study how the change in liquor chemistry affected the evaporation of kraft black liquor when lignin was removed using the LignoBoost process. Lignin was removed from a Softwood kraft black liquor and four different black liquors were studied; one reference black liquor (with no lignin extracted), two lignin lean black liquors with a lignin removal rate of 5. 5 % and 21 % respectively and finally one liquor with maximum lignin removal of 60 %. Evaporation tests were carried out at the research evaporator in Chalmers University of Technology. Studied parameters were liquor viscosity, boiling point rise, heat transfer coefficient, scaling propensity, changes in liquor chemical composition and tube incrustation. It was found that the solubility limit for incrustation changed towards lower dry solids for the lignin lean black liquors due to an increased salt content. The scaling obtained on the tubes was easily cleaned with <b>thin</b> <b>liquor</b> at 105 °C. It was also shown that the liquor viscosity decreased exponentially with increased lignin outtake and hence, the heat transfer coefficient increased with increased lignin outtake. Long term tests, operated about 6 percentage dry solids units above the solubility limit for incrustation for all liquors, showed that the heat transfer coefficient increased from 650 W/m 2 K for the reference liquor to 1500 W/m 2 K for the liquor with highest lignin separation degree, 60 %...|$|E

Application: This study can be used to help assess the consequences for an evaporation plant concerning both changes in capacity and risk for fouling when evaluating a biorefinery concept, including lignin removal, at a mill. It also adds novel information to the research work on black liquor evaporation.

40|$|Background: Intra-partum {{finding of}} {{umbilical}} cord around the baby&# 146;s neck {{is a common}} finding, seen in {{about a third of}} normal deliveries. This nuchal cord has often been the scapegoat for complicated deliveries with adverse outcome like asphyxia or stillbirth. The aim of the study is to compare the perinatal outcome in full term vaginal deliveries in babies with cord around the neck and without cord intra-partum. Methods: A total of 300 full term deliveries in labour were studied, with 150 cases with a single or multiple loops of cord and another 150 cases without cord around the neck. The cases were chosen randomly in a study period between August 2012 and May 2013. Perinatal outcome is analysed in the new-borns by means of APGAR score of the neonate at 1 and 5 minutes, NICU admission and complications till day 7 of life. Results: 74 % of the 150 deliveries with the cord around the neck were uneventful with clear liquor status and normal FHR variability. 22 % of the cases had <b>thin</b> meconium stained <b>liquor</b> and 4 % were associated with thick meconium stained liquor. The difference in the Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes between the study and the control group was statistically not significant. Also there was no statistically significant difference in NICU admissions and neonatal morbidity. Conclusions: The study has concluded that the finding of cord round the neck in fetuses does not cause any specific adverse outcome in properly monitored labor. The study has not shown any stillbirth that could be attributed to the cord. Hence, mention of a nuchal cord in the ultrasound reports does not warrant panic and a safe vaginal delivery can be contemplated successfully.
