5|$|Manuel {{had proven}} {{himself to be}} an {{energetic}} emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, {{in spite of his}} military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish Sultanate of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Peace of Venice. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>a</b> national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies. According to Edward Gibbon, Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.|$|E
5|$|On September 1 and 2, Florida Power Company {{received}} {{help from}} Gulf Coast companies to return power to 170,000 customers before the assisting companies' home areas {{were struck by}} the hurricane. Power was restored to most areas by September 4, with an exception being St. George's Island; service {{was expected to be}} restored after several additional days. More broadly, owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state, which went into effect {{less than a month after}} the storm. The new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property's prior history and surrounding buildings before approval <b>to</b> <b>rebuild</b> <b>a</b> demolished structure would be granted. Governor Graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt. Recovery efforts after Hurricane Elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage; for example, beach replenishment at Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County began in the summer of 1990.|$|E

5|$|The Main Stand of Edgeley Park, {{which in}} 1935 {{was made of}} wood, burned down in a fire, {{destroying}} all of Stockport County's records before 1935.

Towards {{the end of this}} season, Stockport had a ten-game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last-day title decider against Lincoln City in which more than 27,000 fans watched.
