5|$|Pneumonia is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> Severity is variable.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing</b> due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E

50|$|Other known {{symptoms}} of overdose are: clumsiness or unsteadiness, being severely drowsy, having a severely dry mouth, nose, or throat, having an altered mood or other mental changes, seizures, being {{short of breath}} or having <b>troubled</b> <b>breathing,</b> a dry and warm, flushed skin.|$|R
5|$|Travelling to {{the airport}} for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also {{suffering}} from malaria and having <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> It is unlikely she will survive a natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two hours away. They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains the doors and they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing,</b> but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing,</b> and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days. The best {{treatment}} of stings is to first wash the area with soap and water, then use an antiseptic, and if swelling remains apply an ice pack. Many people are allergic to wasp venom, {{and if this is}} the case, a sting can result in severe anaphylactic shock. Symptoms of this include swelling of airways, including mouth lips and tongue, <b>troubled</b> <b>breathing,</b> dizziness and tightness of chest. If an individual exhibits any of these symptoms after acquiring a sting from R. romandi seek medical attention immediately.|$|R

None of these movements occasioned the slightest rustling of the newspaper. When the cone was moving no sound was heard. The floor was of hard-wood, and, as one's hearing becomes very acute in the darkness, I am certain the psychic did not rise from her chair. She was, for the most part, silent as a dead woman.|$|R
25|$|On June 20, 2009, {{a filter}} pump on Bahari River malfunctioned, sending twenty-four guests and {{employees}} to the hospital. At 6:25 pm, the pump, which was turned off at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of <b>troubled</b> <b>breathing</b> and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening. It was later determined that an interlock system designed to prevent chemical feeders from pumping chemicals into the water when the pump was turned off had malfunctioned.|$|R
25|$|Symptoms of an {{allergic}} reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1653 {{priests and}} people {{assembled}} in the church of Our Lady at Mattanceri, and {{standing in front of}} a cross and lighted candles swore upon the holy Gospel that they would no longer obey Garcia, and that they would have nothing further to do with the Jesuits they would recognise the archdeacon as the governor of their church. This is the famous oath of the Koonen Cross (the open-air Cross which stands outside the church at Mattenchery). The Thomas Christians did not at any point suggest that they wished to separate themselves from the pope. They could no longer tolerate the arrogance of Garcia. And their detestation of the Jesuits, to whose overbearing attitude and lack of sympathy they attributed all their <b>troubles,</b> <b>breathes</b> through all the documents of the time.

25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies. When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of barbiturates. As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of barbiturates, including drug dependence and accidental overdose. When barbiturates are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the baby is born, it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> In addition, nursing mothers who take barbiturates may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to barbiturates is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1992 Ms Amey {{was one of}} {{five members}} of a Meteorological Service team, {{stationed}} on the remote sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, who were snorkelling when one of them, Mr Mike Fraser, was attacked by a shark, {{believed to be a}} white pointer. The other swimmers, apart from Ms Amey, swam to shore. Ms Amey waited until the shark moved away from Mr Fraser and then went to his aid and towed him to shore. Mr Fraser had lost his right forearm and his left forearm was severely lacerated and appeared to be broken. He was having <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing</b> and required urgent medical treatment.

25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing,</b> a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>trouble</b> {{can range}} from mild to severe. In some children, it is not noticeable, aside from fast {{breathing}}. In most children, breathing problems are serious.

500|$|Gay {{and others}} were only {{slightly}} injured, but Patton hit {{his head on the}} glass partition in the back seat. He began bleeding from a gash to the head and complained that he was paralyzed and having <b>trouble</b> <b>breathing.</b> Taken to a hospital in Heidelberg, Patton was discovered to have a compression fracture and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth vertebrae, resulting in a broken neck and cervical spinal cord injury that rendered him paralyzed from the neck down. He spent most of the next 12 days in spinal traction to decrease spinal pressure. All non-medical visitors, except for Patton's wife, who had flown from the U.S., were forbidden. Patton, who had been told he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life, at one point commented, [...] "This is a hell of a way to die." [...] He died in his sleep of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure at about 18:00 on December 21, 1945.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Four {{diacetyl}} {{workers were}} found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Exposures, respiratory symptoms, lung function and exposure-response relationships were investigated. METHODS: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. Exposure data were used to model diacetyl exposure. Lung function and questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms were compared to a general population sample and respiratory symptoms to an internal reference group. RESULTS: Workers were potentially exposed to acetoin, diacetyl, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. Historic diacetyl exposure ranged from 1. 8 to 351 mg/m(3), and from 3 to 396 mg/m(3) for specific tasks. Diacetyl workers reported significantly more respiratory symptoms compared to the general population sample (continuous <b>trouble</b> with <b>breathing</b> (prevalence ratio (PR) = 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 3 to 5. 1), daily cough (PR = 1. 5; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 2. 1), asthma attack (ever) (PR = 2. 0; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 3. 4), doctor diagnosed asthma (PR = 2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 3 to 3. 8) and asthma attack in the last year (PR = 4. 7; 95 % CI 1. 9 to 11. 4)) and to a minimally exposed internal reference group (ever <b>trouble</b> with <b>breathing</b> (PR = 2. 8; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 7. 0) and work-related shortness of breath in the last year (PR = 7. 5; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 52. 9)). Lung function did not differ between groups. A positive relationship between exposure and FEV(1) was found. CONCLUSION: The excess of respiratory symptoms in this retrospective cohort suggests that diacetyl production poses an occupational hazard. Limited historical exposure data did not support a quantitative individual diacetyl exposure-response relationship, but our findings suggest that preventive measures are prudent...|$|R
40|$|The study, {{which is}} based on data from a {{household}} level health survey conducted in early 1993 in the rural areas of the districts of Western Area and Port Loko of Sierra Leone, examines the coverage of an Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), infant and child mortality, and disease symptoms among children died under age five in the study area. The results of the study indicated that the infant and child mortality rate per thousand live births declined from about 162 in the mid 1980 s to about 77 in 1993. This decline was associated with immunization coverage which considerably increased by 1993, reaching as high as above 60 % of the eligible children. The study further reveals that the major symptoms of disease at the time of death of an infant or a child were fever, cough, <b>troubled</b> <b>breathing,</b> and diarrhea in that order. While fever and cough could reflect the persistence of malaria and pneumonia [...] two major causes of infant and child deaths not covered by existing EPI [...] the study also revealed that many children failed to take full doses of immunization. Similarly, inadequate coverage of domiciliary oral rehydration therapy (ORT) might have been the reason of high incidence of diarrhea-related deaths. Simple medical technologies to eliminate many of the existing major causes of infant and child mortality in rural Sierra Leone are now available. Perhaps, a strengthened primary health care service, including an extensive rural health care network, aimed at eliminating these diseases, {{would go a long way}} in reducing infant and child mortality to irreducible minimum. immunization coverage reduction in infant and child mortality disease symptoms among children died under age five rural Sierra Leone...|$|R
