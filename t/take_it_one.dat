At the Elimination Chamber event, the Wyatt Family {{attacked}} Cena during his Elimination Chamber {{match for the}} same championship, which directly led to Cena's elimination from the match. Wyatt was motivated {{by a desire to}} end [...] "this era of lies", beginning with Cena, because he wanted to expose to the world that Cena being an upholder of all that is moral and good and right was merely a hollow illusion. Proving that Cena was a fraud would ruin his legacy, but Wyatt wanted to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>one</b> step further by turning Cena into a monster. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Cena issued Wyatt a challenge for a match at WrestleMania, which Wyatt accepted.|$|E
500|$|Morrow {{reported}} that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as [...] "appeasement gestures". According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television [...] "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them. By the mid-1970s, commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming. Other critics hoped that Sesame Street, with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It {{was not until the}} mid-1990s when a children's television educational program, Blue's Clues, used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of Blue's Clues were influenced by Sesame Street, but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>one</b> step further".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Revere {{was back}} hitting mainly {{at the top of}} the order after manager Charlie Manuel decided to adjust the lineup in hopes of {{sparking}} some offense. He managed two hits in a game against the Miami Marlins on June 3, stole two bases, and stopped an extra-base hit from Adeiny Hechavarria. [...] "I just have to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>one</b> game at a time and not put any pressure on myself. I'm finding my stroke", Revere later said of the game. On July 13, Revere suffered a fractured foot after a foul ball hit him while at-bat. He had surgery for the fracture on July 16. Although the initial timetable for Revere's return was six to eight weeks, the Phillies official website later published an article stating that there was no timetable for his return and they were unsure whether or not he will return for a remainder of the 2013 season. He ended up missing the rest of the 2013 season, and finished with a [...]305 batting average, 0 home runs, 17 runs batted in and 22 stolen bases.|$|E

500|$|The creators' and producers' {{goals were}} to [...] "empower, challenge, {{and build the}} {{self-esteem}} of preschoolers" [...] while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research. [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>one</b> step further," [...] Santomero said. [...] Like Sesame Street, formative research which the producers called their [...] "secret sauce," [...] was used during {{all aspects of the}} creative and decision-making process during the production of Blue's Clues. In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by Variety its [...] "call and response style," [...] that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and prosocial messages. In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra. The research team and creators worked collaboratively.|$|E

6000|$|The {{wind was}} now blowing strongly, {{but if it}} did not rise the boat would assuredly make the land. Archie took the helm, having learned {{somewhat}} of the steering on previous excursions, and the three fishermen tugged at the oars. It was a cross sea, for although the wind now blew nearly in their teeth, it had until the last half hour been from the west, and the waves were rolling in from the Atlantic. The boat, however, made fair progress, and Archie began to think that the doubts of the fishermen as to their making the shore were in no wise justified, when suddenly a gust, far stronger than those they had hitherto met, struck the boat.

6000|$|I {{have one}} remark more before I leave this damp {{part of the}} world, and which I cannot omit on the women's account, namely, that I took notice of a strange decay of the sex here; insomuch that all along this country it was very {{frequent}} to meet with men that had had from five or six to fourteen or fifteen wives; nay, and some more. And I was informed that in the marshes {{on the other side}} of the river over against Candy Island there was a farmer who was then living with the five-and-twentieth wife, and that his son, who was but about thirty-five years old, had already had about fourteen. Indeed, this part of the story I only had by report, though from good hands too; but the other is well known and easy to be inquired into about Fobbing, Curringham, Thundersly, Benfleet, Prittlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Cricksea, Burnham, Dengy, and other towns of the like situation. The reason, as a merry fellow told me, who said he had had about a dozen and a half of wives (though I found afterwards he fibbed a little) was this: That they being bred in the marshes themselves and seasoned to the place, did pretty well with it; but that they always went up into the hilly country, or, to speak their own language, into the uplands for a wife. That when they took the young lasses out of the wholesome and fresh air they were healthy, fresh, and clear, and well; but when they came out of their native air into the marshes among the fogs and damps, there they presently changed their complexion, got an ague or two, and seldom held it above half a year, or a year at most; [...] "And then," [...] said he, [...] "we go to the uplands again and fetch another;" [...] so that marrying of wives was reckoned a kind of good farm to them. It is true the fellow told this in a kind of drollery and mirth; but the fact, for all that, is certainly true; and that they have abundance of wives by that very means. Nor is it less true that the inhabitants in these places do not hold it out, as in other countries, and as first you seldom meet with very ancient people among the poor, as in other places we do, so, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>one</b> with another, not one-half of the inhabitants are natives of the place; but such as from other countries or in other parts of this country settle here for the advantage of good farms; for which I appeal to any impartial inquiry, having myself examined into it critically in several places.|$|E
