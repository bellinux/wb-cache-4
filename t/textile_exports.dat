25|$|These changes {{had also}} ramifications in other theatres of trade, like the Baltic and the Levant, because the access of Dutch weavers to {{high-quality}} Spanish wool made Dutch textiles more attractive in the Baltic and the Levant than the previously ascendant English textiles. The consequence was a disastrous slump in the English textile industry after 1648. As the English were more dependent in their {{trade with the}} Baltic and Russia on their <b>textile</b> <b>exports,</b> their share in these trades therefore also declined.|$|E

25|$|From {{virtually}} {{an industrial}} backwater in 1978, China {{is now the}} world's biggest producer of concrete, steel, ships and textiles, and has the world's largest automobile market. Chinese steel output quadrupled between 1980 and 2000, and from 2000 to 2006 rose from 128.5million tons to 418.8million tons, one-third of global production. Labor productivity at some Chinese steel firms exceeds Western productivity. From 1975 to 1992, China's automobile production rose from 139,800 to 1.1million, rising to 9.35million in 2008. Light industries such as textiles saw an even greater increase, due to reduced government interference. Chinese <b>textile</b> <b>exports</b> increased from 4.6% of world exports in 1980 to 24.1% in 2005. Textile output increased 18-fold over the same period.|$|E
25|$|England {{could no}} longer compete in the {{carrying}} trade to Spain and Portugal; the Dover entrepot that had competed successfully with the Amsterdam one in the 1640s {{as far as the}} Mediterranean was concerned, completely collapsed; the transmission of silver to Flanders was switched by the Spanish bankers to Amsterdam from London. But England lost not just the carrying trade. Far more important was that the ascendancy of English <b>textile</b> <b>exports</b> to Spain was now lost, that had been total in the 1640s, as had been the English role in Spanish wool exports. Within a year or two this was completely reversed by the Dutch who in 1650 handled 80 percent of this trade. Dutch lakens and camlets took over the Spanish textile market, whereas Holland also took over the entrepot for Ibero-American dyestuffs.|$|E

2500|$|Important changes {{occurred}} in several specific trade categories in the 1970s and 1980s. Imports of textile fibers rose from 5.8 percent in 1975 to 10.7 percent in 1980 as the Chinese textile industry grew faster than domestic cotton supplies but then fell to 4 percent in 1985 as domestic cotton production increased. Imports of unfinished textile products also increased from 1.3 percent in 1975 to 5.3 percent in 1985 {{as a result}} of textile industry growth. Iron and steel accounted for approximately 20 percent of imports in the 1970s, fell to 11.6 percent in 1980, then rose to 14.9 percent in 1985. Imports of manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment represented 62.6 percent of total import value in 1975, fell to 53.9 percent in 1980 as imports were cut back during the [...] "period of readjustment" [...] of the economy (1979–81), and rose again to 75.2 percent in 1985. On the export side, the share of foodstuffs fell to 12.5 percent in 1985. The fastest growing export item in the 1970s was petroleum, which was first exported in 1973. Petroleum rocketed to 12.1 percent of all exports in 1975, 22 percent in 1980, and 21.2 percent in 1985. In the 1980s <b>textile</b> <b>exports</b> grew rapidly. Although exports of unfinished textiles remained about 14 percent of total exports, all categories of <b>textile</b> <b>exports</b> rose from 5 percent in 1975 to 18.7 percent in 1984.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} import {{competition}} from China on the Belgian textiles sector. Our analysis comprises both trade data and firm-level data. We study {{the evolution of the}} unit values in <b>textiles</b> <b>exported</b> from China into the EU versus <b>textiles</b> <b>exported</b> from Belgium {{to the rest of the}} EU over the past ten years. We clearly find evidence of a widening price gap between Chinese and Belgian <b>textiles</b> <b>export</b> prices. Chinese <b>textiles</b> seem to become relatively cheaper over time. These findings are in line with Schott (2004; 2007) who argues that capital abundant countries in the US and Europe use their endowment advantage to produce product varieties that are superior in quality compared to labour intensive countries like China. Next we use firm-level data on Belgian textiles firms in search of evidence of quality and skill upgrading in Belgian <b>textiles</b> <b>exports.</b> We study the evolution of firm-level variables such as R&D outlays, the proportion of skilled and unskilled labour and capital intensity used in production. Both China’s entry into the WTO and the end of the Multi-Fibre Agreement significantly seem to cause important shifts in firm level production processes.
