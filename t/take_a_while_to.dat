25|$|Kicks in play can, if successful, {{result in}} rapid field advancement. Towards {{the end of}} the tackle count, the ball will often find its way to the best kicker on the team who will then return {{possession}} of the ball to the other side in the most favourable position for his team by kicking it down to the other end. These kicks are sometimes intended to go into touch (leave the field of play), resulting in a scrum to restart play. Scrums <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> form, so this gives the attacking team a chance for a short rest before play resumes.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees use a {{combination}} of colour and spatial relationships to learn from which flowers to forage. They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, which occur due to atmospheric electricity, and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> leak away into the ground. They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee. After arriving at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongues ("glossae") and store it in their crops. Many species of bumblebees also exhibit [...] "nectar robbing": instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.|$|E

[...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by.

Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E

There were several starts in the 1920s and '30s and by 1939 we had grown back into a Goulburn-based competition.

500|$|David Blackwell of Enterline Media {{thought that}} Sanctuary was an [...] "interesting concept", but felt {{the first six}} episodes were [...] "hit-or-miss". Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it really works and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> kick in, {{but it is a}} very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season should really be for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E
500|$|During {{the process}} of {{founding}} a colony, {{as many as four}} queens cooperate with each other to find a suitable nesting ground, but after the first generation of workers is born, they fight each other until one queen is left alive. However, occasional colonies are known to have as many as six queens coexisting peacefully in the presence of workers. A queen searches for a suitable nest site to establish her colony, and excavates a small chamber in the soil or under logs and rocks, where she takes care of her young. A queen also hunts for prey instead of staying in her nest, a behaviour known as claustral colony founding. Although queens do provide sufficient amounts of food to feed their larvae, the first workers are [...] "nanitics" [...] (or minims), smaller than the smallest workers encountered in older developed colonies. Several species do not have any worker caste, and solitary queens will raid a colony, kill the residing queen, and take over the colony. The first generation of workers may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> fully develop into adults; for example, M. forficata eggs take around 100 days to fully develop, while other species may take up to eight months.|$|E
500|$|Merit is a [...] "beneficial and {{protective}} force which extends {{over a long}} period of time" [...] (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds ( [...] , [...] ) done through physical action, words, or thought. As its Pāli language (the language of Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, etc.) definition indicates, this force is associated with goodness and purity of mind. In traditional Buddhist societies, it is believed that merit is more sustainable than that of magical rites, spirit worship or worldly power. The way merit works, is that acts of merit bring good and agreeable results, whereas demeritorious acts bring bad and disagreeable results. A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This [...] (...) or [...] "automatic cosmic reaction" [...] (Brokaw) is a common idea found in Buddhist texts and Buddhist societies, and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways. Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it. Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous. Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits. The merits and demerits a person has done may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> bear fruit. Merit or demerit may cause a good or bad future respectively, including in the next lives to come. A bad destination after rebirth may be caused by demerit, but merely a lack of merit may also lead a person to be born in an unhappy destination. When someone is reborn in a happy destination, however, one can only stay there as long as merits last. Thus, it is stated in the Tipiṭaka that people cannot take anything with them when they die, except for whatever merit and demerit they have done, which will affect their future. Merit can be accumulated in different quantities, and stored up, but also has an impermanent character: it can run out. Summarizing from the Buddhist text Milinda Pañhā, some scholars conclude that merit is inherently stronger than demerit. Moreover, many merits together have the power to prevent demerits from having an effect, by pushing them [...] "to the back of the queue" [...] (Richard Gombrich), though demerits can never be undone.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major part}} of the work {{involved}} Manson rewriting the song lyrics, which Vig said the band attempted to [...] "write from a woman's perspective and I think, initially, some of them were a little pretentious. But as soon as Shirley came on board she simplified the lyrics so that they were a lot more subtle and worked better as songs." [...] Manson detailed that regarding the previous song sketches, [...] "some of the ideas for lyrics I found unsuitable, and others I liked and worked on with them.

2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>to</b> work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
