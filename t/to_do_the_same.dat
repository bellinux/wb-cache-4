5|$|Historian Allan Nevins {{believes}} Grant {{had been}} hoodwinked. When Baxter {{refused to sign}} two million dollars' worth of fraudulent railroad bonds, Boss Shepherd and Senator Dorsey turned against him and convinced Grant <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up the ground. In the night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended {{the first day of}} fighting.|$|E
5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures {{to deal with this}} were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far {{the most common type of}} parallel programs.|$|R

50|$|After {{the death}} of Saint Eligius in 661, the Life of Eligius — written soon after Chlothar's death — records that a plague reduced the {{population}} of France's cities. A plague in the British Isles, according <b>to</b> Bede, <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> there in 664.|$|R
5|$|However, the Cabildo {{appointed}} a Junta headed by Cisneros, who {{would stay in}} power, even if under a new office. Saavedra was appointed to this Junta, as well as Castelli and two peninsulars. They made the oath of office, but the Junta was received with strong popular unrest, as it was perceived as going contrary to {{the result of the}} open cabildo. By the night, Saavedra and Castelli resigned, convincing Cisneros <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Coca-Cola began a {{collaboration}} with Emeco {{to create a}} 1006-based chair made out of recycled Coca-Cola bottles, which was released in 2010.

5|$|Late in 1997, {{the club}} was offered to merge with Gold Coast-based team the Gold Coast Chargers, which would {{be known as the}} Gold Coast Mariners and would be based in the Gold Coast. However the Gold Coast party withdrew late to go alone in the 1998 competition, and while the Mariners tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> they, along with South Queensland Crushers and Western Reds, were not {{admitted}} into the NRL competition, thus ending their tenure as a first-grade rugby league team.|$|E

40|$|Individuals have {{various kinds}} of obligations: keep promises, don’t cause harm, return {{benefits}} received from injustices, be partial to loved ones, help the needy and so on. How does this work for group agents? There are two questions here. The first is whether groups can bear <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kinds of obligations as individuals. The second is whether groups’ pro tanto obligations plug into what they all-things-considered ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> degree that individuals’ pro tanto obligations plug into what they all-things-considered ought <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We argue for parity on both count...|$|R

5|$|Such reenactment pantomimes became {{hugely popular}} and spread {{throughout}} Christendom. Within {{a hundred years}} every church in Italy was {{expected to have a}} nativity scene at Christmastime. Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings. Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged others <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Florida mouse is nocturnal, and {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year except on especially cold nights. The mouse can climb, but is primarily a terrestrial species.

5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises.

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this position is that the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs.

5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's nose was {{operated}} on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised students <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> exhorting {{them to move}} onto the front foot to drive instead.|$|E
5|$|We were {{informed}} of {{the prospect of a}} shortening in food rations. 300 grams of meat or sausage per week.

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was {{a victory for the}} Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn increasing reliance on group {{decision making and}} advances in computer technology have combined to spur research {{in an area of}} decision support known as group decision support systems (GDSS). Proponents of GDSS claim its unique features enable groups to make decisions faster, better and with greater confidence and satisfaction than non-GDSS groups. This study is an empirical experiment evaluating the operational effectiveness of a GDSS. A complex scenario covertly resembling the Cuban missile crisis was passed out to seven groups of four graduate students. Four groups were instructed to recommend a solution to the crisis scenario {{with the aid of a}} GDSS. The other three groups were instructed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but without computer aided support. The analysis of the data indicated that there was not an appreciable difference in decision quality, speed, or satisfaction between the GDSS groups and the non-GDSS groups.

5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} Kuomintang military pressure.

In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, {{he was not able}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled.

50|$|Apart from {{outright}} incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, {{perhaps the}} most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation.
