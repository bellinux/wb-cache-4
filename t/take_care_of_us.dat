2500|$|Escrivá's {{younger brother}} Santiago stated {{that his brother}} [...] "loved {{the members of his}} family" [...] and took good care of them. When their father died, he says, Escrivá told their mother that [...] "she should stay calm, because he will always <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> And he {{fulfilled}} this promise." [...] Escrivá would find time in his busy schedule to chat and take a walk with his younger brother, acting like a father towards him. When the family transferred to Madrid, he obeyed the instructions of their father that he obtain a doctorate in Law. [...] "Thanks to his docility to this advice", says Santiago, [...] "he was able to support the family by giving classes in Law, and with this he acquired a juridical mentality ... which would later be so necessary to do Opus Dei." [...] Monsignor Escrivá also modified his first name. From José María, he changed it to the original Josemaría. Biographers state, that around 1935 , [...] "he joined his first two names because his single love for the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph were equally inseparable".|$|E

2500|$|By his own account, he [...] "missed {{deploying}} to the Gulf War by a hair." [...] Moulitsas {{has described}} the Army as [...] "perhaps the ideal society– we worked hard but the Army <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in return." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Mary, lightly enough; [...] "there's {{only two}} things generally true of them. At certain curious times they're just fit to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and they're never fit {{to take care of}} themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you glad, Judith, to {{find you}} had no father! He <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have done no more. I don't {{understand}} why he wasn't a father." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No--that's what I'm telling you. Mr. Smith {{came and}} <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He brought our wood, he cooked for us, he kept our fire going. He {{gave up his}} bed, even his blankets, for us. You should be very generous to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{think he}} would object," [...] Geoffrey said. [...] "If you go up and ask him, Master Lirriper, and say that you will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> you know, I don't see why he should say no." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you won't {{leave us}} now, will you?" [...] said little Ivanka pitifully, getting on my knee and {{nestling}} on my breast; [...] "you {{will stay with}} father, won't you, and help to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> I'm so frightened!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Elinor," [...] she {{presently}} added, [...] "we must employ Edward to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in {{our return}} to Barton. In {{a week or}} two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge." ...|$|E

'I do know,' said Nuttie, exasperated {{perhaps by}} the {{contrast}} {{in the mirror}} opposite between her own swelled, disfigured face, and the soft tender one of her mother with the liquid eyes.

6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{want you}} for what Mr. Crabbe can do for us, but it does make me feel right and at ease in telling you of what might {{otherwise}} seem too near home.

"That's right, my good fellow," [...] cried Will, with a laugh, {{slapping}} the native on the shoulder; [...] "you have {{just come in}} the nick of time to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> all, for, besides having utterly lost ourselves, we are quite ignorant of forest ways in this region--no better than children, in fact." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "As the {{political}} situation worsened day by day in East Timor, hundreds of young people, students and activists fled East Timor and arrived in Java. Many of them sought political asylum in foreign embassies in Jakarta. Those who stayed behind sought refuge among Indonesian friends. Several took refuge {{in the house of}} Princen for months.

6000|$|The {{nurse was}} thankful {{to her for}} so doing, and a {{somewhat}} graver mood had come over Minna as she laid her head on her pillow, for she asked the difficult question, 'Can mamma see us now?' which Mary could only answer with a tender 'Perhaps,' and an attempt to direct the child to {{the thought of the}} Heavenly Father; and then Minna asked, 'Who will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{was rather}} frightened, because I thought the {{soldiers}} {{might come up}} here. And Monna Lisa was a little afraid too, for she said they might carry our kids off; {{she said it was}} their business to do mischief. But the Holy Madonna <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> for we never saw one of them up here. But something has happened, only I hardly dare tell you, and that is what I was saying more Aves for." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; but {{my father}} had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, {{and that was my}} last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were well taken care of.
