5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two {{candidates}} {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that it was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> included in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Raj asks Chauthrani to {{take his}} case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer (Paresh Rawal). Initially, {{the bulk of the}} {{evidence}} is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice mail to the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power and status, but when he could not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.|$|E
5|$|When {{a hacker}} {{downloads}} decades' worth of classified information about aliens onto a digital tape, he {{gives it to}} Mulder, who finds that the entire <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> written in Navajo. Cigarette Smoking Man begins searching for the tape and visits Mulder's father, who calls Mulder to see him shortly afterwards. Before he can reveal anything to Mulder however, he is murdered by Alex Krycek. Scully brings Mulder to New Mexico where she introduces him to Albert Hosteen, a code-talker who can translate the digital tape. Albert's grandson shows Mulder a boxcar filled with alien corpses. Cigarette Smoking Man tracks Mulder's location however and orders the boxcar burned.|$|E
50|$|Mamie <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a Chinese American {{immigrant}} born in San Francisco. Her parents, Joseph Tape (1852-1935), and Mary McGladery <b>Tape</b> (1857-1934), <b>were</b> both {{immigrants from}} China. Joseph <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a businessman and an interpreter for the Chinese consulate, while Mary <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> an amateur photographer and artist.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> an {{effective}} replacement for paints. <b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> much faster {{and easier to}} install and replace, which dramatically reduces down times related to painting aisles and rails. Many floor <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> scuff and break resistant, unlike paints that will chip and scratch off. And most of all, <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> much easier to store and transport; they have much higher shelf lives than paints that, if stored improperly, won't last long.|$|R
50|$|While no master <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the {{traditional}} sense, stereo <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> in fact created while cutting to enable future remastering.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
25|$|A {{measuring}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> pulled {{around the}} torso at the inframammary fold. The <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> then pulled tight while remaining horizontal and {{parallel to the}} floor. The measurement in inches is then rounded to the nearest even number for the band size.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> {{wrapped around}} toes to reduce chafing and blisters.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays masking <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} for {{decorative}} purposes. They are printed with different patterns, some Japanese <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> made of washi paper.|$|R
5000|$|ATS/360 {{provided}} its own access {{methods and}} file formats. Offline [...] "format and print" [...] <b>tapes</b> could <b>be</b> printed using standard OS utilities as these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> compatible with BSAM, although these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> created using EXCP.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the final}} mixes on DAT format were almost lost when the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> mangled badly. That <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} repaired allowing recovery of the mixes for this record.|$|R
25|$|Kapton <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the live players, electronic music on <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> played back over loudspeakers in the hall.|$|E
25|$|Each machine {{begins in}} state A with an {{infinite}} tape that contains all 0s. Thus, the initial symbol {{read from the}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a 0.|$|E
30|$|Adhesive Scotch <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{placed on}} the surface of the {{honeycomb}} films in order to remove the top portion of the polymer thin film. The surface of the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> rubbed smoothly with the thumb to ensure full contact with the top layer of the honeycomb film without trapped air. Then, the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> peeled off slowly. The prepared nano-needle arrays were brought into analysis and stamping.|$|R
50|$|Precision {{diameter}} <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} measuring the true diameters of both round and out-of-round forms. Used in the metal working industry, these <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> precision tools made of 1095 clock spring steel.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} of Ultrium <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> going to be available with four types of cartridge, holding 10 GB, 30 GB, 50 GB, and 100 GB. Only the full length 100 GB <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> produced.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} grip <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{not typically}} used on LED hoops {{because it would}} block the lights. Sanded tubing can provide added friction, as can a thin strip of grip tape along {{the inside of the}} hoop.|$|E
25|$|Limitations in {{the disc}} cutting {{part of the}} process later {{generated}} the idea that half-speed mastering would improve quality (in which the source <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> played at half-speed and the lacquer–aluminium disc cut at rpm rather than rpm).|$|E
25|$|Victoria's Secret {{uses this}} method, where a {{measuring}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> pulled around the torso under the armpit {{and above the}} bust. Because band sizes are most commonly manufactured in even numbers, the wearer must round to the closest even number.|$|E
30|$|The mass {{contents}} of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber filament and glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> 70 – 75  % and almost 59  % respectively. The volume {{contents of}} fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber filament and glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> almost 55  % and almost 39  %. Obviously, the mass content and volume content of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> lower.|$|R
5000|$|Their second studio album Truth on <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in the United States on February 9, 2010. Truth on <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> produced by David Castell. The title track [...] "Truth on Tape" [...] was mixed by Tim Palmer.|$|R
50|$|He was {{commissioned}} between 1992 and 1993 to help Princess Diana to develop her public speaking voice, having {{been introduced to}} her by her personal fitness instructor, Carolan Brown. Settelen video taped Diana talking about her private life. Following her death, the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> seized by the Metropolitan Police in a 2001 raid on {{the home of the}} Princess' butler, Paul Burrell. Ownership of the <b>tapes</b> <b>was</b> contested by her brother, Earl Spencer, but they were returned to Settelen in 2004. Extracts from the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> screened by American broadcaster NBC later the same year, in a programme called Diana Revealed. In August 2017, extracts from the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> screened by Channel 4 television.|$|R
25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} spools, between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic <b>tape)</b> <b>is</b> passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E
25|$|Data {{that has}} passed the {{triggering}} stages and been stored on <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> duplicated using the Grid to additional sites {{around the world for}} easier access and redundancy. Physicists are then able to use the Grid to access and run their analyses on the data.|$|E
25|$|Thermally {{conductive}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} cost-effective heat sink attachment materials. It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation. It consists of a thermally conductive carrier material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on each side.|$|E
40|$|In a {{randomized}} trial of wound closure in 512 abdominal wounds, wounds were closed with either reinforced Steristrip skin closures or interrupted silk sutures. Comparisons {{were made of}} wound pain and discomfort, wound infection, discharge, redness, width, and skin reaction. The causes of peeling of the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> assessed. The results showed that <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> significantly more comfortable and that patients preferred them to sutures (P less than 0. 01), but wide scars occurred more often. There {{was no difference in}} rates of wound infection and no case of allergy to the <b>tapes</b> <b>was</b> seen. Closure of abdominal wounds by these <b>tapes</b> <b>is</b> a satisfactory procedure that could be used more extensively...|$|R
50|$|When {{constructed}} with plastic films instead of paper, masking <b>tapes</b> can <b>be</b> used for more rigorous applications. Polyester-based <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> used {{to mask off}} during etching, plating, and in particular, powder coating. Tapes based on polyimide films can resist molten solder in electronics applications. Glass cloth <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> often used in powder coating and sandblasting operations. Foil or vinyl <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> often used in plating. Layered tapes made from multiple materials laminated together {{can be used for}} masking flame spray, thermal spray and HVOF. Masking <b>tape</b> can also <b>be</b> used to adhere posters to walls up to the day rating. Masking <b>tape</b> can basically <b>be</b> used for any purpose required of it, and is not limited solely to painting needs.|$|R
50|$|The Goddard Center's Data Evaluation Laboratory has {{the only}} known {{surviving}} piece of equipment which can read the missing <b>tapes</b> and <b>was</b> set to be closed in October 2006, causing some fear that, even if the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> later found, {{there would be no}} ready way to read and copy them. However, equipment that could read the <b>tapes</b> <b>was</b> maintained.|$|R
25|$|A {{tape measure}} or {{measuring}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a flexible form of ruler. It {{consists of a}} ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or metal strip with linear-measurement markings. The design on which most modern spring tape measures are built was invented and patented by a New Haven, Connecticut resident named Alvin J. Fellows on July 14, 1868.|$|E
25|$|This method {{begins the}} same way as the underbust +0 method, where a {{measuring}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> pulled tight around the torso under the bust while remaining horizontal. If the measurement is even, 4 is added to calculate the band size. If it is odd, 5 is added. Kohl’s uses this method for its online fitting guide.|$|E
25|$|Ticker <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{means of}} {{transmitting}} stock price information over telegraph lines. It consists of a paper strip which ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company symbols followed by price and volume information. Ticker tape was invented in 1867 by Edward A. Calahan, {{an employee of the}} American Telegraph Company.|$|E
2500|$|There <b>were</b> {{no music}} <b>tape</b> {{versions}} of the Yesterday and Today [...] "Butcher Cover". Eight-track and reel-to-reel <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> issued approximately {{one month after the}} vinyl album was released in 1966 and cassette <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> not issued by Capitol Records until 1968.|$|R
50|$|A further {{reduction}} to 25 µm {{resulted in}} double-play tapes of 2400' on a seven-inch reel. This and thinner <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> not commonly used on ten-and-a-half-inch reels, as the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> too fragile for the angular {{momentum of the}} larger reels, particularly when rewinding.|$|R
50|$|Until 2013, {{the song}} was only {{available}} in mono because the studio multi-track <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{believed to have been}} stolen sometime in 1980. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> retrieved thirty years later; the first true stereo mix was released on the Made in California box set.|$|R
