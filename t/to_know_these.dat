5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its brittleness, and on the handling, crushing and milling it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and coking ovens at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|E

Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> to compute an accurate figure. The graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15°C and a relative humidity of 0%.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for the woman to witness {{the flow of blood}} itself; it is sufficient for her to notice a stain that has indications of having originated in her womb; bloodstains alone are inadequate without such evidence, for example, if she finds a stain just after cutting her finger, she does not become a niddah, as the blood is not obviously uterine. If she notices a bloodstain of uncertain origin, for example on her underclothing, there are a series of complicated criteria used by rabbinical law to determine whether she is niddah or not; the woman herself is not expected <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> criteria, and must seek the assistance of a rabbi.|$|E
25|$|In part, secrecy {{was also}} {{maintained}} by the way scripts were written. Performers were given the first two scripts {{at the start of}} principal photography, but additional scripts were written only after Chibnall had observed the actors bringing their characters to life. Once the scripts for episodes six, seven, and eight were finished, they were released all at once—but only to those crew and cast who had a need <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>These</b> three episodes were then shot together. The secrecy campaign did not, however, prevent the cast and crew from trying to guess the murderer's identity. During production, photographs of all the cast members were pasted up in a production trailer, and cast and crew placed bets on who they thought the killer was.|$|E
500|$|The Cuban iguana is {{well-established}} {{in public}} and private collections. Many zoological parks and private individuals keep them in captive breeding programs, minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade. Cuban iguanas are listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the IUCN Red List, as is the predominant Cuban subspecies, while the Cayman Island subspecies is [...] "critically endangered". The total population in Cuba is estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the feral population on Isla Magueyes is estimated at over 1,000. According to Allison Alberts, Chief Conservation Officer of the San Diego Zoo and lead researcher in Cuba, among the many wildlife species at GTMO, [...] "The Cuban Iguana is one of the largest, undoubtedly the most visible, and certainly the most charismatic.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for JazzTimes, Tom Terrell said {{this kind of}} music would never be heard again, deeming it [...] "tomorrow's sound yesterday... a terrifyingly exhilarating aural asylum of wails, howls, clanks, chanks, telltale heartbeats, wah wah quacks, white noise and loud silences." [...] According to Down Beat, the frantic burbles of congas on [...] "Moja" [...] and [...] "Tatu" [...] predated oldschool jungle by 20 years, while Spin journalist Erik Davis found its anguished, ferocious music extremely impressive, especially when listened to loud. He contended that the group improvisation on tracks such as [...] "Wili" [...] foreshadowed the drum 'n' bass genre: [...] "Miles was invoking the primordial powers of the electronic urban jungle". In The Penguin Guide to Jazz (1998), Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote that each performance comprises only [...] "shadings and sanations of sound, and as one gets <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> recordings better one becomes almost fixated on the tiniest inflexions." [...] Pitchfork critic Jason Josephes regarded it as a highly valued Davis record that invokes a sense of coolness in listeners.|$|E

As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Maimonides equated {{knowledge}} of God's attributes with {{knowledge of}} God's works. Because in [...] God taught Moses attributes that refer solely to God's works, Maimonides inferred that God had promised to give Moses a knowledge of God's works. Maimonides thus concluded that the ways that Moses wished to know, and which God taught him, were God's actions. Maimonides equated these with what the Sages called [...] "attributes" [...] ( [...] , middot), noting that the Talmud spoke of the 13 [...] "attributes" [...] ( [...] , middot) of God.. And the Mishnah also used the term in reference to man, saying, for example, [...] "There are four different sorts ( [...] , middot) among those who go {{to the house of}} learning," [...] and, [...] "There are four different traits ( [...] , middot) among those who give charity." [...] Maimonides argued that the Sages did not mean that God really possesses attributes, but that God performs actions similar to human actions that in humans flow from certain attributes and certain mental dispositions, whereas God has no such dispositions. Although Moses was shown all God's goodness, that is, all God's works, [...] mentions only the 13 attributes, because they include those acts of God that refer to the creation and the government of mankind, and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>these</b> acts was the principal object of the prayer of Moses. Maimonides found evidence for this in the conclusion of the prayer of Moses in [...] "that I may know You, that I may find grace in Your sight, and consider that this nation is Your people." [...] That is, Moses sought understanding of God's ways in governing the Israelites, so that Moses might act similarly. Maimonides concluded that [...] "the ways" [...] used in the Bible are identical with the [...] "attributes" [...] used in the Mishnah, denoting the acts emanating from God in reference to the universe.|$|E
