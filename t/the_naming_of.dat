5|$|In 1937, Garran {{was made}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the {{establishment}} of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, and his link with ANU is remembered by <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> a chair in the university's School of Law, by <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall and by <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school.|$|E

The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, and was only lucid at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick).

Regardless, the move is also known in Spanish by the less tendentious names of tijera and tijereta—both {{a reference to the}} manoeuvre's scissor-like motion.|$|E

5|$|His {{dispute with}} the General Assembly over <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> a land {{registrar}} left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} {{seaborgium}} were produced in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States.

5|$|In {{recent years}} the river has been dually known by the {{indigenous}} Kaurna people's name of Karra wirra-parri (meaning river of the Red Gum forest), referring to the dense eucalyptus forest that lined its banks prior to clearing by early settlers. This name, alternatively Karra-weera, only referred to the lake section of the river, between Adelaide and North Adelaide. It was known as Karrundo-ingga at Hindmarsh, Witoingga near the reed beds, and Yertala everywhere when in flood, which has survived as Yatala in <b>the</b> <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> various places in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium were made from laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States.
