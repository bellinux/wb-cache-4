In the wake of a famous battle, especially one that marked the culmination of a war such as Ulundi on 4 July 1879, every European involved in the battle appeared to want to own an object <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a reminder of the event.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} {{extensions}} started October 14, 1971 with Line 1 (Green) {{towards the}} east to reach {{the site where the}} Olympic Stadium was to be built and Autoroute 25 (Honoré-Beaugrand station) <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a transfer point for visitors arriving from outside. The extensions were an opportunity to make improvements to the network, such as new trains, larger stations and even semi-automatic control. The first extension was completed in June 1976 just before the Olympics. Line 1 was later extended to the southwest to reach the suburbs of Verdun and LaSalle with the Angrignon as the terminus station, named after the zoo. This station opened in September 1978.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway's first {{concern was}} to occupy ground <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a base both for {{continuing}} the advance toward the complex and, {{in view of}} the enemy's evident offensive preparations, for developing a defensive position. The base selected, line Kansas, traced the lower bank of the Imjin in the west. From the Imjin eastward as far as the Hwach'on Reservoir the line lay two to six miles (3–10km) above the 38th parallel across the approaches to the Iron Triangle. Following the lower shoreline of the reservoir, it then turned slightly north to a depth of ten miles (16km) above the parallel before falling off southeastward to the Yangyang area on the coast. In the advance to line Kansas, designated Operation Rugged, the I and IX Corps were to seize the segment of the line between the Imjin and {{the western edge of the}} Hwach'on Reservoir. To the east, the X Corps was to occupy the portion tracing the reservoir shore and reaching Route 24 in the Soyang River valley, and the ROK III and I Corps were to take the section between Route 24 and Yangyang.|$|E

The resulting design was unsatisfactory, since the requirements for the roles were contradictory. For example, powerful engines necessary for the high top speeds needed in a fleet scout were also very coal hungry, which reduced the ship's endurance; a long cruising radius was mandatory for ships intended to police Germany's far-flung colonial empire, however.|$|E
500|$|After several {{visits to}} the Auca village, which the missionaries called [...] "Terminal City", they {{observed}} that the Huaorani seemed excited to receive their gifts.

After several more drops, in November the Huaorani began tying gifts for the missionaries to the line after removing the gifts the missionaries gave them. The men took this {{as a gesture of}} friendliness and developed plans for meeting the Huaorani on the ground. Saint soon identified a 200-yard (200m) sandbar along the Curaray River about 4.5miles (7km) from Terminal City <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a runway and camp site, and dubbed it [...] "Palm Beach".|$|E
