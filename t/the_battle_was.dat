5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> still ongoing, not after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> concluded.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who were convinced that <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> over once Fort 54 fell. <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the 230th {{anniversary of}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> commemorated by a re-enactment event hosted {{by members of}} the recreated 2nd Virginia Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In May 1455, Northumberland was {{travelling}} {{with the}} king and Somerset to a great council at Leicester, when the party was intercepted by York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the First Battle of St Albans, the royal forces clashed with the forces loyal to the Duke of York, {{in what has been}} described as the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> a complete victory for the Yorkist side, and led to another reversal of the political situation. The king was taken captive, and Somerset was killed. Northumberland was also among the casualties, and was buried at the nearby St Albans Abbey. A suggestion made by a contemporary chronicler, and supported by modern-day historians, said that the true purpose of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> to settle personal scores. Once York and Salisbury had killed Somerset and Northumberland respectively, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> effectively over.|$|E

5|$|Lochry's Defeat, {{also known}} as the Lochry massacre, was a battle fought on August 24, 1781, near present-day Aurora, Indiana, in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> part of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which began as a {{conflict}} between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies before spreading to the western frontier, where American Indians entered the war as British allies. <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> short and decisive: about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant, a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west, ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania militiamen led by Archibald Lochry. Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians without suffering any casualties.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{long-term}} consequence of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> {{the death of}} the tourmarches Diogenes: by virtue of his unusual prominence in Theophanes's account, Henri Grégoire identified this Diogenes with the original archetype for the later epic hero Digenes Akritas.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> {{a turning}} point in the war for North Korean forces, which had seen {{previous}} victories owing to superior numbers and equipment, with the distances and demands exacted on them at P'ohang-dong rendering their supply lines untenable.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the largest}} in Medieval Europe and is {{regarded}} as the most important victory in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, also it's widely celebrated in Belarus. It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders. During the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> used in Nazi and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.|$|E
5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for the coin was very low, just 26,928.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>is</b> {{a central}} event in Sir Walter Scott's 1816 novel, Old Mortality. Scott fictionalises <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> and <b>the</b> {{events leading up}} to it, {{introducing}} real people who were not actually present, such as General Tam Dalyell, as well as his own fictional characters. However, his description of the flow of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>is</b> considered accurate.|$|R

This system allows for fast multiplayer games.|$|R

5|$|Although {{probably}} {{outnumbered by}} a substantial margin, Julian's army won a complete victory after a hard-fought struggle. With negligible casualties of their own, the Romans drove the Alamanni beyond the river Rhine, inflicting heavy losses.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, {{communist}} Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijević, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>was</b> a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>was</b> a Croat.|$|E
