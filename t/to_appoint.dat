5|$|However, even {{following}} Romanum decet pontificem, {{only three}} of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal. The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> a cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia. Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E

If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E

5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> anyone to executive positions.|$|E

5|$|Senators {{are elected}} in even-numbered {{years when the}} President of the United States is not being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent {{election}} was in November 2014. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> the recommended person. Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E

In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E
