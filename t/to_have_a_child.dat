30|$|Similar to {{the case}} of the firstborn {{daughter}}, the second daughter also increases the likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> third <b>child.</b> The effect, however, is smaller than that of the firstborn girl. Parents of a second daughter are 1.7 percentage points more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third <b>child.</b> Further, while parents with two sons are 1.2 percentage points less likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third <b>child,</b> parents with two girls are 4.5 percentage points more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third <b>child.</b> This also shows that parents of a mix of male and female children are 2.4 percentage points less likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third <b>child</b> relative <b>to</b> parents of same-sex children.|$|R

30|$|The {{fact that}} sibling-fixed effects results are smaller (closer to zero) than OLS results {{confirms}} our prior that latent unobserved family-level characteristics (like lower ability) are related <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> fewer years after migration {{as well as}} to lower exam grades. Thus, the fixed effects estimation changes the OLS results in the expected direction.|$|R

Bollywood Hungama critics said that her character was wasted, as again she gets very little screen time. However, she did pick up the Stardust Exciting New Face Award.|$|E

For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E

Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over.
