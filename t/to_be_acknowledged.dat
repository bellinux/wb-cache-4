Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pelé had in 1964 with her housemaid Anizia Machado, fought for years <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> by Pelé, who refused to submit to DNA tests. Although she was recognized by courts as his biologically daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pelé never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, nor her two children, Octavio and Gabriel. Pelé also had another daughter, Flávia Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz. Flávia was recognized by him as his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Separately, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government {{announced}} on St. George's Day 2013 in a symbolic move that England's historic and traditional counties still exist. They are now recognised by the government, who will now encourage the marking and {{continued use of}} such traditional county names by the existing tiers of local government and residents. A follow up announcement in April 2014 put forward an initiative in changing planning regulations, stating that 'traditional county' names can be placed on roadsigns. The same Government department also published an online map comparing the current and historic counties. The {{main body of the}} pre-1889 boundaries appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged,</b> but Worcestershire's islands including Dudley and Shipston-on-Stour are omitted.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and all he wanted was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

25|$|In {{imperial}} China, clerks used an abbreviated, highly cursive form of Chinese {{characters to}} record court proceedings and criminal confessions. These records {{were used to}} create more formal transcripts. One cornerstone of imperial court proceedings was that all confessions had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> by the accused's signature, personal seal, or thumbprint, requiring fast writing. Versions of this technique survived in clerical professions into the modern day, and influenced by Western shorthand methods, some new methods were invented.|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys {{because he has been}} put in artistically sacrosanct position and this is not in conformance with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change {{the fact that this is}} an important part of his collected works that needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E
25|$|Changmarín {{was born}} in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, being the second son of an out-of-wedlock union between Carlos Chang, a rich, Chinese-Panamanian merchant, and Faustina Marin, a campesina. He grew up among his mother's family, being unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> in public by his father under the {{conservative}} values of Panama's countryside of the early 1920s. However, later his father decided to take him from his mother {{when he was still}} a child and sent him to live with a paternal aunt. His aunt was brutally abusive, treating him basically as a slave, constantly humiliating his mixed heritage and his mother's social status. The father, although not participating in the abuse, provided no protection from it and even promoted this behavior in some cases.|$|E

25|$|Australian {{architectural}} historian John James, {{who made}} a detailed study of the cathedral, has estimated that there were about 300 men working on the site at any one time, although it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that current knowledge of working practices at this time is somewhat limited. Normally medieval churches were built {{from east to west}} so that the choir could be completed first and put into use (with a temporary wall sealing off the west end) while the crossing and nave were completed. Canon Delaporte argued that building work started at the crossing and proceeded outwards from there, but the evidence in the stonework itself is unequivocal, especially within the level of the triforium: the nave was at all times more advanced than ambulatory bays of the choir, and this has been confirmed by dendrochronology.|$|E
25|$|During the {{negotiations}} regarding the succession to the throne, she supported the Gustavian Party, who wished for the deposed King's son, the former Crown Prince Gustav, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as {{heir to the}} throne. During a dinner, General Baron Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had asked him whether her spouse (Charles XIII) had any issue, and was interested when he found that he had not. When she remarked that the throne had an heir in the deposed King's son, Adlersparre stated {{that none of the}} instigators of the coup would accept this, as they feared that the boy would avenge his father when he became King, and that to prevent this they would go as far as to take up the old rumor that the deposed King was in fact the illegitimate son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila.|$|E
25|$|Globalization {{can benefit}} people with non-communicable {{diseases}} such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the World Trade Organization can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While {{it has to be}} admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates how much a government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.|$|E

25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged.</b> Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours}} of the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
25|$|Women in pre-modern society {{were seen}} as bearers of children, {{retailers}} of fish, and farmers. Within the traditional sphere, the childbearing ability of women was explained as {{the means by which}} lineage ancestors were allowed to be reborn. In pre-colonial times, polygamy was encouraged, especially for wealthy men. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was seen as a traditional means for parents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> for taking good care of their daughters. Also to thank them for the good training. Within the last couples of decades, the roles of the feminine gender has evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women no longer 'belong to the kitchen', roles and responsibilities which hitherto remained the prerogative of females is now very common with males. Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as a host of past and current political office holders. This renaissance {{is a direct result of}} the efforts put in by Ghana's vibrant civil society. Women have since risen to positions of professional importance in southern Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Erica Kane and Dimitri Marick {{fall in love}} {{while he}} is {{attempting}} a hostile takeover of her cosmetics company, Enchantment. They appear in a face-to-face meeting on TV's Market Street Week to debate. Afterwards, they meet privately and argue, at which point their animosity turns to passion and he pulls her into a kiss that she responds to. Their relationship cannot go further than that because he is married to Angelique Voynitzeva and {{she is in a}} loveless marriage to Adam Chandler. Dimitri pursues her despite these roadblocks. Erica turns down his advances, refusing to be anyone's mistress. Eventually he wears down her resistance and they begin an affair. He promises to divorce Angelique, but has a hard time doing so because she is not in the best of health. Once free of their spouses, Erica and Dimitri travel to Budapest in his native country, Hungary. While in Budapest, Erica is kidnapped twice.

500|$|It {{is only in}} the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld {{and other}} female {{educational}} writers are beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acknowledged</b> in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself. As Myers points out, [...] "the writing woman as teacher has not captured the imagination of feminist scholars", and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to [...] "the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps". The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a [...] "nostalgia for lost youth and [...] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom" [...] not shared by many female writers at this time.|$|E
