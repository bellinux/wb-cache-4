5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a first <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activities that would define his later military career.

It was claimed by Ograd owners Eli and Yuval Orgad that Israelis preferred the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local brand over the American chain. One blogger, a former manager of a Burger King in the United States, claimed that both chains were basically the same in product and preparations, it was Burger King's failure to fully adapt to the local market tastes that doomed them in that country. By 6 September 2010 all 55 locations in the country were closed down and converted to Burgeranches.|$|E

5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E
5|$|The strong <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fruit body}} {{may have some}} role in insects {{avoiding}} it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T.felleus in North America, though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E

5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of starchy {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Opéra, and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new opera clientele.

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances the <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks {{through the use of}} heavy stones or presses.|$|E
