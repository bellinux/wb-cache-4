Each mouse in the capsaicin group was subcutaneously injected {{with the amount of}} 0. 1 mL/ 10 g into L 5 and L 6 spinal cords; each mouse in the capsazepine group was intraperitoneally injected with the amount of 0. 1 mL/ 10 g. Similarly, each mouse in the moxibustion group was given a suspended moxibustion with specially-made moxa-stick for 20 min on L 5 and L 6 spinal cords. Each mouse in MC group was intraperitoneally injected with the amount of 0. 1 mL/ 10 g first, then after 15 min was given a suspended moxibustion for 20 min on L 5 and L 6 spinal cords. Each mouse in WT moxibustion group and KO moxibustion group was given a suspended moxibustion with specially-made moxa-stick for 20 min on L 5 and L 6 spinal cords.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{patients with}} Diabetes Mellitus type 2 and painful peripheral neuropathy {{in order to}} investigate oral complaints and facial somatosensory findings. Research design and methods: Case-control study; 29 patients (12 women, mean age 57. 86 yo) with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 and 31 age-gender-matched controls were evaluated with a standardized protocol for general characteristics, orofacial pain, research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders, visual analogue scale and McGill Pain questionnaire, and a systematic protocol of quantitative sensory testing for bilateral facial sensitivity at the areas innervated by the trigeminal branches, which included the thermal detection by ThermoSensi 2, tactile evaluation with vonFrey filaments, and superficial pain thresholds with a superficial algometer (Micromar). Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon, chi-square, confidence intervals and Spearman (p < 0. 05). Results: Orofacial pain was reported by 55. 2 % of patients, and the most common descriptor was fatigue (50 %); 17. 2 % had burning mouth. Myofascial temporomandibular disorders were diagnosed in 9 (31 %) patients. The study group showed higher sensory <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> at the right maxillary branch (p = 0. 017) but sensorial differences were not associated with pain (p = 0. 608). Glycemia and HbA(1 c) were positively correlated with the quantitative sensory testing results <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> (p < 0. 05) and cold (p = 0. 044) perceptions. Higher pain thresholds were correlated with higher glycemia and glycated hemoglobin (p = 0. 027 and p = 0. 026).

40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} believed that athletes experience pain {{in a different}} way than normally active individuals. Many scientists have confirmed the hypothesis that long-term physical activity can alter the perception <b>of</b> <b>pain,</b> i. e. athletes have a higher pain sensation and pain tolerance <b>thresholds.</b> The measurement <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> intensity is carried out using subjective methods based on verbal and non-verbal information, describing the clinical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> These psychological methods include the use of scales and questionnaires. Objective methods (thermal, mechanical and electrical) are used only to determine the pain sensation and pain tolerance thresholds. The specificity and prevalence <b>of</b> chronic <b>pain</b> syndromes have resulted in the increased number of studies on healthy and physically active individuals. It seems that determination of the effects of exercise on the perception <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> might help in the understanding <b>of</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> generation.

40|$|AuthorObjective and background: Stress-induced visceral {{hypersensitivity}} may {{play an important}} role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but not in functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS). We examined rectal sensation in those patients. Methodology: Experiment 1 : Rectal <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> (PT) and maximum tolerance were assessed by barostat with ramp distention before and after repetitive rectal painful distention (RRD). Experiment 2, PT was measured in basal state and after intravenous CRF (100 μg) or vehicle, together with or without RRD. Experiment 3 : Three phasic distentions at physiological range were randomly loaded. The subjects were asked to mark the visual analogue scale (VAS) in reference to subjective intensity of sensation. Results: Experiment 1 : Majority of IBS patients showed rectal hypersensitivity before RRD in contrast to FAPS. All IBS patients developed hypersensitivity after RRD, however, none of the FAPS patients did. RRD significantly reduced both thresholds in IBS (n= 7) but did not change in controls (n= 14) and FAPS (n= 6). Experiment 2 : PT was not modified by RRD in placebo group (n= 6), while it was significantly reduced in CRF-treated group (n= 5). On the other hand, CRF (n= 5) or vehicle (n= 5) without RRD did not alter PT. Experiment 3 : The VAS ratings were increased in IBS (n= 7) but significantly decreased in FAPS (n= 6) as compared to controls (n= 14). Conclusions: RRD-induced rectal hypersensitivity seems to be reliable marker for IBS, and CRF may contribute to this response. FAPS patients may have hyposensitivity to non-noxious physiological distention, suggesting FAPS has different pathogenesis from IBS...|$|R

40|$|Pain is a {{protective}} perceptual response shaped by contextual, psychological and sensory inputs, {{particularly those that}} suggest danger to the body. Sensory cues suggesting that a vulnerable body part is moving towards a painful position, may credibly signal danger and thereby modulate pain. In this double-blind repeated-measures experiment, we used virtual reality to investigate whether manipulating visual-proprioceptive cues can alter movement-evoked pain, in 24 people with neck pain. We hypothesised that pain would occur at a lesser degree of head rotation when visual feedback overstated true rotation, and at {{a greater degree of}} head rotation when visual feedback understated true rotation. Our hypothesis was clearly supported: when vision overstated the amount <b>of</b> rotation, <b>pain</b> occurred at 7 % less rotation, and when vision understated rotation, pain occurred at 6 % greater rotation, relative to the neutral condition. We conclude that visual-proprioceptive information modulates the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> movement-evoked <b>pain.</b> This suggests that stimuli such as movement-related inputs, that become associated with pain, can in turn contribute to pain.

Spironolactone significantly shortened response latency in the mouse tail-flick test but produced modest de-creases in response latencies in the mouse hot plate test. The drug reduced the antinociceptive effect of tramadol {{in the hot}} plate test. Spironolactone in addition decreased nociceptive <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> electrically-induced <b>pain</b> in mice. In contrast, spironolactone elicited significant antinociceptive actions in the mouse acetic-acid-induced writhing assay and at doses of 20 - 160 mg/kg decreased capsaicin-induced chemogenic pain.

The withdrawal study evaluated loss of therapeutic response in patients who achieved ≥ 50 % pain improvements after receiving up to 3. 25 years of milnacipran. This post-hoc analysis investigated whether patients who met lower <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> improvement also experienced worsening of fibromyalgia symptoms upon treatment withdrawal. Method: Among patients who received milnacipran ≥ 100 mg/day during the long-term study, three subgroups were identified based on percentage <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> reduction at randomization: ≥ 50 % (protocol-defined "responders"; n= 150); ≥ 30 % to < 50 % (patients with clinically meaningful pain improvement; n= 61); and < 30 % (n= 110). Efficacy assessments included the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR), 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF- 36 PCS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: In the ≥ 30 to < 50 % subgroup, significant worsening in pain was detected after treatment withdrawal. The difference between placebo and milnacipran in mean VAS score changes for this subgroup (+ 9. 0, P< 0. 05) was similar to the difference in protocol-defined responders (+ 9. 4, P< 0. 05). In the < 30 % subgroup, no worsening in pain was observed in either treatment arm. However, patients in this subgroup experienced significant worsening in FIQR scores after treatment withdrawal (placebo, + 6. 9; milnacipran, - 2. 8; P< 0. 001), as well as worsening in SF- 36 PCS and BDI scores. Conclusion: Patients who experienced ≥ 30 % to < 50 % pain reduction with long-term milnacipran had significant worsening of fibromyalgia symptoms after treatment withdrawal. These results suggest that the conventional ≥ 30 % pain responder cutoff may be adequate to demonstrate efficacy in randomized withdrawal studies of fibromyalgia.

This analysis explored graphically {{the relationship between}} pain relief and functional improvement in patients with neuropathic pain associated {{with spinal cord injury}} in two clinical trials of pregabalin. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of two randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in patients who were treated with pregabalin (n= 181) or placebo (n= 172) for neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. The bivariate relationship between percent pain relief and absolute change in the functional outcomes with placebo and pregabalin was evaluated graphically using scatter plots, and loess curves illustrated the extent of the relationship between pain and function. Linear trend analysis evaluated the statistical significance of these relationships using Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) -based <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> reduction (< 15 %, 15 % < 30 %, 30 % to < 50 %, and ≥ 50 %). Outcome measures included modified Brief Pain Inventory pain interference with function in one of the studies and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (an 11 -point Numeric Rating Scale) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the pooled studies. Results: Data ellipses showed a shift with pregabalin relative to placebo toward greater improvement with increasing pain relief for all outcome measures except HADS.
