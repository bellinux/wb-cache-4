500|$|The Post {{was worried}} about how the episode would affect Pakistan: [...] "This is going to ratchet up {{religious}} sentiments, and could lead to increased polarization between the moderates and extremists in the country, the former including General Musharraf {{under the banner of}} 'enlightened moderation'." [...] The Islam newspaper criticised the government, stating, [...] "The government cannot absolve itself of the tragedy. If it wanted, the matter could have been resolved at the start. But this was not done and, {{for the first time in}} the history of Pakistan, our own security forces not only bombarded a mosque and religious seminary, but also brought in armored personnel carriers, tanks and helicopter gunships in numbers <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> wonder. This shows that all this activity was masterminded by some satanic minds. This incident is tragic, shameful and dangerous. How much it has harmed the country and the nation, and how worse an impact it will leave on the country on the future, can at this point only be imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically True Blue was a {{different}} direction for Madonna. Her previous efforts had her singing in a high pitched voice. With this album, Madonna toned it down for a more bubblegum-pop voice. The songs on the album reflect this {{and a number of}} instruments were used in the songs to bring out the different moods which the lyrics emphasized. [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] features acoustic, electric, and rhythm guitars, keyboards, and string arrangements. The song samples Beethoven's Appassionata sonata. A continuous percussion filled structure was used in [...] "Open Your Heart". [...] "White Heat" [...] sampling of the film's quotation was included with speech and gunshots. It is an uptempo dance song with synth bass and double-tracked vocals supported by male voices in the chorus. [...] "I don't write dance music and I don't see it as contributing to the cultural growth of the world," [...] grumbled Pat Leonard in 1992. [...] "At the time we were doing the groove stuff on the True Blue album, it was semi-innovative. There wasn't a precedent <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> gag. God forbid that I might have contributed to the mess we're in now." ...|$|E

500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E

The films share a wonderfully British wry humor. They're not laugh-out-loud funny, but there's quite a bit to amuse you when thinking about the scenes later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two years later, Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, where she served as head judge for Miss America 2016 and sang [...] "Oh How the Years Go By." [...] After this performance, Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating:I have been {{a close friend of}} this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.Williams responded by stating that she did the [...] "best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} album, which involved creating [...] "microloops" [...] that involved building up one-bar samples into multiple bars {{that would make}} up a full song, Palomo said that in composing this album, he recorded a riff from a sound he made and tried to [...] "keep that momentum up". On Era Extraña, {{in order to develop}} ideas he was having while recording the record, it was necessary for him to have more control of the effects and instruments he was using for the album. Making the album helped him learn how to create synth sounds and become a [...] "gear geek", instead of relying on presets as he did with his previous works. He said, [...] "The more tedious aspects of production do have the capacity to take the wind out of your sails, so you always have to navigate through that as quickly as you can before you start feeling burnt on the song, before you forget that initial spark <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> even want to write it in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Luis Paez-Pumar of Rolling Stone {{described}} WrestleMania as [...] "two-faced as a Gemini"—the {{first half}} [...] "was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> think that WWE {{knew what it}} was doing all along with this lackluster build", but once Triple H appeared, the rest of the event [...] "was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as [...] "should have retired when the Streak was broken", but [...] "lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that [...] "WWE has no idea how to handle Bray Wyatt", writing that Orton [...] "definitely did not need the title" [...] and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of [...] "projected video screen grossness" [...] as [...] "the dumbest crap". Paez-Pumar called for [...] "fresh blood or new ideas" [...] in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he [...] "has not put on a good Mania match" [...] since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldberg–Lesnar was a [...] "revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine", Cena's proposal was [...] "magic in a way that no other entertainment can match", The New Day [...] "were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not", while [...] "a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of Raw" [...] due to the return of the Hardys.|$|E

The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|E
