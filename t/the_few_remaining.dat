5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted raids on Parliamentary forces in the region, representing a continuing challenge. No action had been taken, however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the spiritual}} {{administration}} of the missions was given to German-speaking Franciscan missionaries.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Franco-Spanish expedition, Carolinians led Native American raiding expeditions that besieged Pensacola, one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> Spanish outposts in Florida. They also mobilized Native American forces to attack Mobile, but these efforts were frustrated by French diplomatic activities in the Native American communities and also by false rumors of another Franco-Spanish expedition.|$|E

5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. <b>The</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Riverview {{became one}} of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> single-screen theaters in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area; {{by the end of}} the 1980s, it was one of only six left, and after 1998, it was one of only four left, with the Uptown and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema, {{although}} since 1998, several new single-screen theaters–the Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater–have opened. The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and more space between patrons.|$|E

5|$|The harbour is very shallow {{in places}} and {{contains}} {{a number of}} islands, notably Brownsea Island, {{the birthplace of the}} Scouting movement and one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south, lie atop Western Europe's largest onshore oil field. The field, operated by Perenco from Wytch Farm, has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} Highway58 begins at a junction {{with the former}} Highway3 {{in the city of}} Port Colborne, several kilometres north of Lake Erie. South of this intersection, the road once continued as Niagara Regional Road 64 to Killaly Street; such has since been downloaded to the city of Port Colborne. Proceeding north, the highway, known locally as West Side Road, passes through the suburbs of Port Colborne, north of which it skirts {{the eastern edge of the}} Wainfleet Bog, one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> habitats of the Massasauga Rattlesnake.|$|E
5|$|Warburton Bridge is {{a privately}} owned {{statutory}} tolled undertaking which incorporates a public highway road length. The high-level cantilever bridge crosses the Manchester Ship Canal on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge spanned the River Mersey {{prior to its}} later diversion into the Manchester Ship Canal. Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained. It is one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> pre-motorway toll bridges in the United Kingdom, {{and the only one}} in Greater Manchester.|$|E

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. <b>The</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
