5|$|The Congo serpent eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with <b>the</b> <b>serpent</b> eagle. It {{has been suggested that}} the Congo serpent eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin's hawk-eagle, which could give <b>the</b> <b>serpent</b> eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes the form of <b>the</b> <b>serpent</b> Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours <b>the</b> <b>serpent</b> army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E

5|$|A bronze {{column in}} the shape of {{intertwined}} snakes (<b>the</b> <b>Serpent</b> column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.|$|E
