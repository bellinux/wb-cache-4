5000|$|<b>Turban</b> <b>squash,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "Turk's turban" [...] or [...] "French turban" [...] ("Giraumon" [...] in French), {{is a type of}} squash most often used as a winter squash. It is an heirloom, predating 1820. [...] A {{cultivar}} of Cucurbita maxima, it is closely related to the buttercup squash. It is typically 6 pounds when mature. Colors vary, but are often mottled in shades of orange, green, and white. The squash is used as both a vegetable and as an ornamental gourd. [...] Taste is similar to other C. maxima cultivars, though [...] "not as vibrant," [...] "reminiscent to hazelnut," [...] and [...] "coarse, watery and insipid." [...] Known in the nineteenth century as [...] "the most beautiful in color, and the most worthless in quality, of all the varieties of squash;" [...] selective breeding since then may have improved the flavor.|$|E
