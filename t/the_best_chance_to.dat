El Paíss Carlos Arribas named Spanish rider Abraham Olano as a rider that could {{challenge for the}} overall victory, but questioned his ability as an elite rider.

According to Arribas, Berzin was not in great form coming into the race, but his team doctor, Gianni Mazzoni, believed he could regain the form that helped him win the Giro in 1994. Berzin also had a fully committed team to support him this year, unlike in the previous edition {{where he and his}} teammate Piotr Ugrumov did not cooperate and worked against each other. Lluis Simon of El Punt felt that Olano and Berzin were the favorites coming into the race, further mentioning that Olano had performed better than Berzin in the recent Tour de Romandie.
