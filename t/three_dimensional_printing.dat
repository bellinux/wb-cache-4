This motivated the design and construction of a specialized imaging-oriented <b>Three</b> <b>Dimensional</b> <b>Printing</b> machine, the droplet impact observation station, which this thesis documents. The requirements of the machine are presented, the realized design and operation of the machined described, the results of initial tests of operation presented and areas for further work and improvement outlined. The droplet impact observation station constructed moves a carriage back and forth over a travel of up to 46. 5 inches, at speeds of up to 2 mis with a total velocity ripple of approximately 0. 007 mis. In the station's primary mode of operation, the moving carriage transports a powderbed, while the printhead remains stationary. Tests in which strobe illuminated images of crosshairs mounted on the moving carriage were obtained have demonstrated the ability to time a strobe flash to within +/- 1 - 2 microns. Strobe illuminated images of continuous-jetted droplets produced by the observation station have been obtained. by Akobuije Chijioke. Thesis (S. M.)

While recognizing multiple property requirements of a 3 D scaffold, the central theme is to discuss the critical roles played by the binder and powder properties together with the interplay among processing parameters in the context of the physics of binder-material interaction for the fabrication of implants with predefined architecture having structural complexity. An effort also has been exerted to discuss the existing challenges to translate the design concepts and material/binder formulations to develop implantable scaffolds with a more emphasis on bioceramics and biopolymers.

40|$|A conference paper {{presented}} at the Electronic Imaging, Society for Imaging Science and Technology/Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers, 26 - 31 January 2008. Advances in rapid prototyping technologies have led to the emergence of three-dimensional printers which can fabricate physical artefacts, including the application of surface colours. In light of these developments, this paper asserts that the need to print colour accurately is just as important for designers using three-dimensional colour printing as it is for two-dimensional inkjet printing. Parallels can be made with two-dimensional digital Inkjet printing and 2 D common problems include: on screen pre-visualisation, colour management methods, colour gamut and maintaining colour accuracy. However, for <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> colour <b>printed</b> objects, there are more variables that will affect the finished colour. These are: the powder and process inks, unevenness of the surface, wax post-coating processes and different infiltration medium and procedures. Furthermore, in some 3 D printers, the K channel is replaced by the binder and so the printer is only using the cyan, magenta and yellow channels. The paper will suggest methods for improving pre-visualisation and accurate pre-viewing of the colours through the manufacture of three-dimensional colour charts as a reference guide for designers so that they can make accurate coloured artefacts.
