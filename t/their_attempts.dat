5|$|The team at RIKEN has {{listed the}} {{synthesis}} of element 121 among their future plans after <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to synthesise element 120 in 2017–2018 and element 119 in 2019–2020. <b>Their</b> <b>attempts</b> at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the fusion of 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to produce new isotopes of oganesson (element 118) in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E

Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to outcompete and disgrace each other, {{but they made}} important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E

5|$|George {{was born}} in Hanover and {{inherited}} the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles.

Although over 50 Roman Catholics were closer to Anne by primogeniture, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne; George was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> failed.|$|E
