25|$|Christie's {{experiments}} with first-person narration, especially in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, saw her attempt {{to expand the}} formal resources of the detective novel. In And Then There Were None (1939), her most successful novel in which none of her detectives appear, her third-person narrative moves fluidly among the perspectives of all of her characters. This need to see different events from alternative perspectives (especially her suspects') indicates that Christie increasingly favoured third-person narration {{over the course of}} her career. In Sad Cypress, for example, the character of a woman on trial is made to <b>think</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murderer when the narrative is written from her perspective: a significant red herring that is only possible due to the narrative method.|$|E

500|$|Rowland was {{the face}} of Diddy's women's {{fragrance}} Empress, the female counterpart to his men's fragrance I Am King. She was also the worldwide ambassador for watchmakers company TW Steel. Rowland's second compilation album, , was released on October 18, 2011, but failed to impact the charts. She also released her first fitness DVD entitled, Sexy Abs with Kelly Rowland. Later that year, {{it was confirmed that}} Rowland would replace Dannii Minogue as a judge for the eighth series of The X Factor UK alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos. Due to a conflicting schedule, Rowland did not return for the ninth series in 2012 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. During the Black Women in Music event held on February 8, 2012, Essence magazine honored Rowland and music executive Sylvia Rhone for their contributions to music. In April 2012, Rowland toured Australia alongside Ludacris, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, and Big Sean for the urban festival, Supafest. That same month, she returned to the big screen playing the supporting role of Brenda in the romantic comedy <b>Think</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Man. The film, which also starred Michael Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, and Kevin Hart, topped the US box office and grossed $91.5 million.

500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, {{it is a good}} idea to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking in the way the two-level account requires—to simultaneously <b>think</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E

500|$|Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment gave <b>Think</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Cat {{one star}} out of five.

Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was equally unimpressed, calling the special [...] "not only one of the most {{embarrassing}} half-hours in the history of television, [...] also a significant step toward the collapse of civilized society". Genzlinger also called the games [...] "idiotic" [...] and added that the infomercial feeling of the show was its [...] "overarching problem".

500|$|Other reviews have echoed {{much of this}} {{positive}} reception.

500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like [...] "story understanding" [...] and [...] "object recognition" [...] that required a machine to <b>think</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> person. In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] {{they had to make}} all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made.
