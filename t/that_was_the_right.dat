Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if we closed the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking I could run outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you could never get a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I could never get around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do, to start on the top and leave me on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia {{joined the}} opinion of the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justice Alito in full and by Justice Thomas in part. Scalia {{addressed}} Justice Stevens' dissent, specifically with regard to the original understanding of the First Amendment. Scalia said Stevens' dissent was [...] "in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment... It never shows why 'the freedom of speech' <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form." [...] He further considered the dissent's exploration of the Framers' views about the [...] "role of corporations in society" [...] to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the First Amendment was written in [...] "terms of speech, not speakers" [...] and that [...] "Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker." [...] Scalia argued that the Free Press clause was originally intended to protect the distribution of written materials and did not only apply to the media specifically. [...] This understanding supported the majority's contention that the Constitution does not allow the Court to separate corporations into media and non-media categories.|$|E

2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E

50|$|After the Battle of Buxar, 1764, the Mughals {{as well as}} the Nawabs of Bengal lost {{effective}} control over the territories then constituting the province of Bengal, which currently comprises the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, as also some parts of Bangladesh.

50|$|Code {{pleading}} {{was first}} introduced in 1850 in New York and in 1872 in California, and eventually spread to 22 other states. Code pleading sought to abolish the distinction between law and equity. It unified civil procedure {{for all types of}} actions as much as possible. The focus shifted from pleading <b>the</b> <b>right</b> form of action (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> procedure) to pleading <b>the</b> <b>right</b> cause of action (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> a substantive right to <b>be</b> enforced by <b>the</b> law).

To wander through unknown lands and be a discoverer had been the dream of his youth. He was naturally reticent, and had never said so to any one but Peggy, who, being the reverse of romantic, was somewhat awe-stricken by the discovery, and, in an imbecile way, encouraged him to hope that, [...] "one of these days he'd 'ave 'is desires gratified, as there was nothink to prevent 'im from goin' to Novazealand--if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to pronounce it--or to Van Demons land--not in a sinful way of course, for they had given up transportin' people there now--though wherever they transported 'em to she couldn't imagine--anyhow, there was nothink to prevent his tryin'."

I was nervous--there were so many people about; but Bob was cool as an iceberg. Several times, when I started forward toward a Chinaman, all nerved and keyed up, Bob dragged me back. He wanted me to get a good hat, and one that fitted. Now a hat came by <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> size but not new; and, after a dozen impossible hats, along would come one that was new but not the right size.

In five years' time you made yourself the terror and abhorrence of your messmates. The worst hands detested you; your captain--that was me, John Gaunt, the chief of sinners--cast you out for a Jonah. (Who was it stabbed the Portuguese and made off inland with his miserable wife? Who, raging drunk on rum, clapped fire to the baracoons and burned the poor soulless creatures in their chains?) Ay, you were a scandal to the Guinea coast, from Lagos down to Calabar; and when at last I sent you ashore, a marooned man--your shipmates, devils as they were, cheering and rejoicing to be quit of you--by heaven, it was a ton's weight off the brig! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{would have}} said in advance that such an article was exactly what he didn't want, but as the shopman pushed up a chair for him and he sat down with {{his elbows on the}} gentle slope of the large, firm lid, he felt that such a basis for {{literature}} would be half the battle. He raised the lid and looked lovingly into the deep interior; he sat ominously silent while his companion dropped the striking words: [...] "Now that's an article I personally covet!" [...] Then when the man mentioned the ridiculous price (they were literally giving it away), he reflected on the economy of having a literary altar on which one could really kindle a fire. A davenport was a compromise, but what was all life but a compromise? He could beat down the dealer, and at Mrs. Bundy's he had to write on an insincere card-table. After he had sat for a minute with his nose in the friendly desk he had a queer impression that it might tell him a secret or two--one of the secrets of form, one of the sacrificial mysteries--though no doubt its career had been literary only in the sense of its helping some old lady to write invitations to dull dinners. There was a strange, faint odour in the receptacle, as if fragrant, hallowed things had once been put away there. When he took his head out of it he said to the shopman: [...] "I don't mind meeting you halfway." [...] He had been told by knowing people that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing. He felt rather vulgar, but the davenport arrived that evening at Jersey Villas.|$|E
