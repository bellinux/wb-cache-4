5|$|<b>Twins</b> <b>were</b> {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements {{of their physical}} attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E
25|$|Monozygotic twins {{who share}} a {{placenta}} can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' <b>twin,</b> <b>is</b> small and anemic, the other, the 'recipient' <b>twin,</b> <b>is</b> large and polycythemic. The lives of both <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> endangered by this condition.|$|R

Traces of cleavage have been observed on {010}. <b>Twinning</b> <b>is</b> very common, with twin plane {110}. The <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> usually contact twins; in a contact twin the two individuals appear to be reflections {{of each other in}} the twin plane. Penetration <b>twins</b> of strontainite <b>are</b> rarer; penetration <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> made up of interpenetrating individuals that are related to each other by rotation about a twin axis. Repeated <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> made up of three or more individuals twinned according to the same law.

5|$|Judith Shakespeare was the {{daughter}} of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway. She was the younger sister of Susanna and the twin sister of Hamnet. Hamnet, however, {{died at the age of}} eleven. Her baptism on 2 February 1585 was recorded as “Judeth Shakespeare” by the vicar, Richard Barton of Coventry, in the parish register for Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon. The <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> named after a husband and wife, Hamnet and Judith Sadler, who were friends of the parents. Hamnet Sadler was a baker in Stratford.|$|E
40|$|Background: Conjoined <b>twinning</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} {{fascinating}} condition that affects human being as well as animals 1, 2, 3.

On April 27, Brie {{made her}} Raw in-ring debut in an eight-Diva tag team match, which her team won. Nikki also made an appearance, reuniting with her twin, as she was under the ring to help Brie during the match. Nikki then made her in-ring debut for the brand the following month in a battle royal, but was eliminated by Beth Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The Bushes {{had tried}} to {{conceive}} for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section, as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether the patients were schizophrenic.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{the use of}} {{terminology}} {{when describing}} parasitic <b>twins</b> has <b>been</b> somewhat inconsistent. By definition, a parasitic <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twin's body. The underdeveloped <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> termed the parasite, and the developed <b>twin</b> <b>is</b> termed the autosite. The autosite can have some abnormalities, as well. For the most part, however, it has developed enough that it can live on its own.|$|R

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Mario and Aldo were {{surprised}} to find a half-mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth. The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle's garage in 1959. They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959. They did not tell their parents that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races. Aldo was seriously hurt {{near the end of}} the season, and their parents were unhappy to find out that the <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> racing. Mario had 21 modified stockcar wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> in travel cots in the middle of the room.

40|$|<b>Twin</b> births <b>are</b> an {{important}} instrumental variable for the endogenous fertility decision. However, in many economic settings, <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> not exogenous as dizygotic <b>twinning</b> <b>is</b> {{known to be}} correlated with maternal characteristics and fertility treatments. Following the medical literature, we assume that monozygotic <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> exogenous, and construct a new instrument, which corrects for the selection bias although monozygotic <b>twinning</b> <b>is</b> usually unobserved. We use longitudinal administrative data from Sweden and US census data and show that the usual <b>twin</b> instrument <b>is</b> not only related to observed but also to unobserved determinants of economic outcomes, while our new instrument is not. We demonstrate the relevance of our new instrument in two labor market applications and find that the classical twin instrument underestimates the true negative effect of fertility on labor force participation and earnings...|$|R
5|$|After his MVP season, Killebrew {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ today). He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew {{was one of only}} four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through {{the second half of the}} year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore's Boog Powell, who won the award. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, a rematch of the previous season. The <b>Twins</b> <b>were</b> again swept, though Killebrew's performance improved as he hit two home runs in three games.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their <b>twins</b> <b>were</b> more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|The Bella Twins {{returned}} to WWE on the March 11, 2013, episode of Raw in a backstage segment with Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow). On the March 15 episode of SmackDown, the twins attacked The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi), {{and the following}} week interfered in matches between Team Rhodes Scholars and Brodus Clay and Tensai, but were attacked by The Funkadactyls. The twins made their in-ring return facing and defeating The Funkadactyls on the March 27 episode of Main Event after interference from Cody Rhodes, and also defeated them on Raw five days later. The Bella <b>Twins</b> <b>were</b> scheduled {{to participate in an}} eight-person tag team match with Team Rhodes Scholars against Tons of Funk (Clay and Tensai) and The Funkadactyls at WrestleMania 29, but the match was cancelled due to time restraints, and instead took place the following night on Raw, where The Bella Twins and Team Rhodes Scollars were defeated. The twins continued their feud with The Funkadactyls throughout April, defeating them in standard tag team, and six-Diva tag team matches. In June, Nikki suffered a fractured tibia.|$|E

5|$|The Tigers led the AL Central {{for periods}} {{at the start}} of the season in April, {{ultimately}} tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although the Tigers went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same stretch to tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, the Tigers were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the <b>Twins</b> <b>were</b> 45–44 but the Twins came back in the second half going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while the Tigers went 38–37 over the same span.

40|$|A minute {{study of}} <b>twins</b> <b>was</b> {{made at the}} time of parturition, with special {{attention}} to the sex, the placenta, the membrane of the ovum, and the difference between the mono-oval and the bi-oval; in addition the type of the blood groups in the <b>twins</b> <b>was</b> examined from the standpoint of inheritance. The following is the general result: The type of blood group in <b>twins</b> <b>is</b> inherited from the parents as regularly as in the ordinary case. Mono oval twins have the same type of blood group in all cases and are of the same sex, while bi-oval <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> in most cases of the same type but a minority are of different types. Bi-oval <b>twins</b> <b>are</b> in most cases of the same in sex and in blood group type. It has been proved that when the type of the blood groups in <b>twins</b> <b>is</b> different the circulation of the blood in the <b>twins</b> has <b>been</b> independently carried on in the fetal stage. It cannot, however, <b>be</b> concluded that <b>twins</b> have had a common blood-circulation in the fetal stage merely from examination of the blood-group type, even when the blood-group type in the <b>twins</b> <b>is</b> identical. 12 pairs of mono-oval twins, and 23 pairs of dual-oval twins, 35 in all, were examined. Of these 35 pairs of twins, 31 had the same blood type while 4 had different blood-group types. Of the twins of the same sex, 27 pairs had the same blood-group type, while only 2 pairs differed in this respect. Among the instances of twins of different sex, two pairs differed in the blood type while 4 pairs had the same type. When the type of the blood group in <b>twins</b> <b>was</b> different, it could be recognized that two kinds of ova or spermatozooids had been concerned in the impregnation. When the blood group type in <b>twins</b> <b>was</b> different, both the parents, or one of the parents, was heterozygotic. The blood group type in <b>twins</b> <b>is</b> an interesting subject for investigation from the standpoints of biology, obstetrics and forensic medicine...|$|R
