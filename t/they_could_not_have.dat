5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly because <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time}} as a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> lived in freshwater only.|$|E

2500|$|The {{population}} {{debate has}} often had ideological underpinnings. Low estimates were sometimes reflective of European notions {{of cultural and}} racial superiority. Historian Francis Jennings argued, [...] "Scholarly wisdom long held that Indians were so inferior in mind and works that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> possibly <b>have</b> created or sustained large populations." ...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the German, Austrian and Ottoman {{force was}} now spread from Hill 110 almost to Bir en Nuss, but with their left flank unprotected. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been {{in good shape}} after {{fighting}} all the previous day in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past {{the right of the}} main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. Had the British infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction, von Kressenstein's force would have had great difficulty escaping.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} of invasion, the Royal Navy would have sailed to the landing places, {{possibly}} taking several days. It is now known that the Germans planned {{to land on the}} southern coast of England; one reason for this site was that the narrow seas of the English Channel could be blocked with mines, submarines and torpedo boats. While German naval forces and the Luftwaffe could have extracted a high price from the Royal Navy, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> hoped to prevent interference with attempts to land a second wave of troops and supplies that would have been essential to German success—even if, by then, the Germans had captured a port essential for bringing in significant heavy equipment. In this scenario, British land forces would have faced the Germans on more equal terms than otherwise and it was only necessary to delay the German advance, preventing a collapse until the German land forces were, at least temporarily, isolated by the Royal Navy and then mounting a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} certain what pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, ridged teeth <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. Stegoceras may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns {{were similar to those}} of iguanid lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear facets from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear facets similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting replacement teeth, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of Stegoceras was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear facets of the teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accomplished this. On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E

5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> come from him.|$|E

Air National Guard KC-135 tankers provided one-third of the Air Force refueling aircraft deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and an additional 35 ANG tanker aircraft conducted air bridge operations.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled that}} ten IRA members, {{including}} the eight killed at Loughgall, had their human rights violated {{by the failure}} of the British Government to conduct a proper investigation into their deaths.

In December 2011, Northern Ireland's Historical Enquiries Team found that not only did the IRA team fire first but that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been safely arrested. They concluded that the SAS were justified in opening fire.|$|E
50|$|Even if the {{supposed}} {{conquest of the}} Menavian islands - Mann and Anglesey - by Edwin of Northumbria, in 616, did take place, it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> led to any permanent results, for when the English were driven from the coasts of Cumberland and Lancashire soon afterwards, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> well <b>have</b> retained their hold on the island {{to the west of}} these coasts.
