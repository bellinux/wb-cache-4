50|$|Although a {{relatively}} weak storm, Oswald produced torrential rains {{over much of}} Queensland. Rainfall peaked in Tully where approximately 1000 mm of rain fell, with 632 mm falling over a 48&#8209;hour span. The township of Scherger received a record-breaking 370 mm in just 24 hours.

50|$|In the S-lay system, the {{pipeline}} assembly is {{done at the}} installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc. The S notation refers {{to the shape of}} {{the pipeline}} as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (<b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>point).</b> The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support. But it may have to contend with severe sea states - these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding. Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.|$|E

40|$|Themain {{purpose of}} this work is to {{contribute}} to {{better understanding of the}} torsion structural stability and kink formation process of flexible risers in catenary configuration. The thesis deals with installation criteria of offshore flexible lines (risers/cables) with focus on the torsion buckling behavior at the <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> <b>point.</b> The study includes both analytical and numerical investigations. The latter is carried out by means of the non-linear finite element program BFLEX 2010. The physical nature of the torsion buckling of catenary risers has been thoroughly analyzed and described in the present work for the models with linear and non-linear material characteristics. It has been found {{that it is important to}} include the riser s section resting on the seabed to the models because it is subjected to friction forces influencing torsion buckling capacity. The numerical performance of the models obtained by BFLEX 2010 software has been compared to the analytical solution represented by the Greenhill s equation. The limitation of the Greenhill s equation with respect to the torsion buckling at the TDP has been evaluated. Significant efforts have been dedicated to investigation of the effect of non-linear moment curvature behavior (the sliding process between riser s layers) on the process of torsion buckling. It has been found that the torsion buckling capacity is directly proportional to the value of the friction moment. The effect of cyclic heave motion of the laying vessel on kink formation process has also been studied at different levels of initial utilization of torsion reaction. Parametric numerical analysis showed that in some cases depending on heave amplitude and amount of initial torsion utilization there can be a severe consequences leading to kink formation. Therefore, the methodology called "Dynamic criterion" has been established for evaluation of the kink formation process and verified for the models with linearly elastic and non-linear material properties. Another important observation has been done from the cyclic heave motion analysis that the structure at the same time can have a compression in the TDP and remain safe against torsion failure modes. This conclusion challenges current offshore industry practice...|$|E
