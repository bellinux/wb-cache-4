40|$|Objectives: Antiretroviral {{treatment}} (ART) scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa {{has made}} it possible to investigate the maintenance of adherence to HIV medications. We describe here adherence <b>to</b> <b>ART</b> and identify its correlates in the Cameroonian context. Design: Prospective cohort study in 9 rural district hospitals. Methods: A mixed logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with adherence <b>to</b> <b>ART</b> in 401 patients with data prospectively collected on adherence. Results: Although 73 % of patients were adherent after the first month on ART, this proportion decreased to 61 % after 24 months. After adjustment for known factors of adherence <b>to</b> <b>ART</b> (such as knowledge, motivation and side-effects), patients who reported willingness <b>to</b> start <b>ART</b> before initiation, those who were satisfied with information provided by their physicians, and those who implemented reminder methods for ART intake {eg, using an alarm clock, mobile phone, or watch [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) ] = 2. 45 (1. 58 to 3. 79), but also the help of a relative to remind them or other methods} {{were more likely to be}} adherent <b>to</b> <b>ART.</b> Conclusions: Besides highlighting some correlates already known to have an impact on adherence <b>to</b> <b>ART,</b> our findings also underline the need to reinforce the counseling component of follow-up through innovative methods. Accordingly, training and implementation research should encourage the use of medication reminder methods, such as mobile phones, to assure adherence over time and improve long-term response <b>to</b> <b>ART...</b>|$|R
