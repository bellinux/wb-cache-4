5|$|State Route 190 {{begins at}} State Route 99 {{just south of}} {{downtown}} Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing {{the south side of}} Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin turns in order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the South Fork Middle Fork {{and the end of the}} western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale, where traffic can turn east <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route J41.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} sign route system {{was created in}} 1934, Sign Route 190 was {{assigned}} to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction, while the remainder to Baker became part of Sign Route 127. However, the highway was not continuous, with the roadway from Tipton (which had been built by Tulare County) ending at Quaking Aspen (east of Camp Nelson) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine. In 1923, Tulare County businessmen had begun to push for a new trans-Sierra highway connecting Porterville with Lone Pine, but were set back by a lack of state aid, as the road was not a state highway. The first piece, which {{would turn out to be}} the only one built, opened in early July 1931 to Quaking Aspen (and became a state highway in 1933). Grading of the 15-mile (24km) Western Divide Highway, a county road that was supposed to continue south to State Route 155 at Greenhorn Summit, was completed from Quaking Aspen south to near Johnsondale in July 1962. A new road from Johnsondale across Sherman Pass, maintained by the United States Forest Service and Tulare and Inyo Counties (the latter as County Route J41), was completed in 1976, allowing traffic on the western segment of SR 190 <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 395, though via a longer route than the proposed SR 190.|$|E
25|$|Many Cubans {{had left}} Cuba for the United States since the Cuban Revolution of 1959. This {{emigration}} was illegal under both Cuban and U.S. laws; e.g., any Cuban found at sea attempting <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>U.S.</b> shores could be deported by the United States or be arrested by Cuban authorities.|$|E

50|$|I-759 {{begins at}} Exit 182 of I-59 in Attalla. From {{this point the}} route travels in an easterly {{direction}} across a marshy area prior <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> its first exit at Black Creek Parkway, a diamond interchange. From the Black Creek exit, I-759 continues in its easterly direction and crosses the Coosa River along a causeway and short bridge prior <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>US</b> 411. At the US 411 interchange, the I-759 designation ends, but the route continues as SR 759 in spanning the Coosa River.|$|R
25|$|The {{expansion}} of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's Law {{is relevant to}} the old conundrum known as Olbers' paradox: if the Universe were infinite, static, and filled with a uniform distribution of stars, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as bright as {{the surface of a}} star. However, the night sky is largely dark. Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the Big Bang theory and in part on the Hubble expansion. In a universe that exists for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had a chance <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> yet, and the paradox is resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects recede from us, which causes the light emanating from them to be redshifted and diminished in brightness.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} feature of the Big Bang spacetime {{is the presence of}} particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us.</b> This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never [...] "catch up" [...] to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future {{that we will be able}} to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.|$|E
500|$|Of Miguel's {{performances}} in Los Angeles, The Orange County Register editor Daniel Chang commented that he [...] "delivered a classy show {{that was as}} much fun to watch {{as it was to}} hear". Chang noted that Miguel [...] "emotes a contagious energy through dramatic facial expressions, fetal-position-like contortions and physical outbursts in time with the music" [...] and complimented his dance moves and the visual sets. [...] Regarding his concert in Houston, Michael D. Clark of the Houston Chronicle said that Miguel [...] "proved, once again, that it isn't necessary to change languages <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>U.S.</b> audiences". He observed that Miguel seemed [...] "determined to balance the upbeat with the overwrought" [...] in contrast to his previous concerts which were dominated by ballads. On the other hand, Clark expressed disappointment that the boleros were sung in medleys which did not allow any of them to stand out.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Route113 Alternate (US113 Alternate) was an {{alternate}} route of US113 that extended [...] from US113 and DE1 in Little Heaven {{north to the}} intersection of US13 and US113 in Dover. US113Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US13 in Dover. The DuPont Highway was paved through Rising Sun by 1920, and {{the entire length of}} the Selbyville–Wilmington highway was complete by 1923. When the U.S. Highway System was finalized in 1926, US 113's northern terminus was at Coopers Corner south of Dover, and US 13 followed State Street through the state capital. US 113 was extended north along State Street to the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake after US 13 was placed on a reconstructed Governors Avenue in 1930. After US 113's bypass of Dover was completed in 1935, US 113 Alternate was established along US 113's former course from Little Heaven to Dover and along State Street and joined US 13 to cross Silver Lake <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 113's northern terminus at the intersection of DuPont Highway and State Street.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{because the}} {{expansion}} of the universe is accelerating, it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never be able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> at any time in the infinite future, because the light never reaches a point where its [...] "peculiar velocity" [...] towards us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance). The current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present would eventually be able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> in the future if the event was less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event was more than 16 billion light-years away.|$|E
2500|$|The DF-26C is an IRBM with a {{range of}} at least , far enough <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>U.S.</b> naval bases in Guam. [...] Few details are known, but it is {{believed}} to be solid-fuelled and road-mobile, allowing it to be stored in underground bunkers and fired at short notice, hence difficult to counter. [...] It is possible that the DF-26C is a follow-up version of the DF-21. [...] Possible warheads include conventional, nuclear or even maneuverable anti-ship and hypersonic warheads.|$|E
2500|$|NY281 was {{assigned}} [...] to {{the portion of}} its alignment between NY90 {{in the village of}} Homer and the hamlet of Preble. In the vicinity of Preble, it initially used modern County Routes108A and108B <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route11. The route was extended northward along the western edge of Tully Lake , following Song Lake and Long Roads to a junction with NY80 west of Tully Center. It was extended southward to NY13 in the town of Cortlandville at some point between 1934 and 1940. In the late 1940s, construction began on a new highway between Preble and Tully Center that bypassed Preble and Tully Lake to the east. It was completed by 1949, at which time it became part of a realigned NY281.|$|E

2500|$|However, Poincaré himself never {{abandoned}} the ether hypothesis and stated in 1900: [...] "Does our ether actually exist ? We know {{the origin of}} our belief in the ether. If light takes several years <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> from a distant star, {{it is no longer}} on the star, nor is it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported, so to speak, by some material agency." [...] And referring to the Fizeau experiment, he even wrote: [...] "The ether is all but in our grasp." [...] He also said the ether is necessary to harmonize Lorentz's theory with Newton's third law. Even in 1912 in a paper called [...] "The Quantum Theory", Poincaré ten times used the word [...] "ether", and described light as [...] "luminous vibrations of the ether".|$|E
2500|$|Pulsars {{are rapidly}} {{rotating}} stars. A pulsar emits beams of radio waves that, like lighthouse beams, sweep {{through the sky}} as the pulsar rotates. The signal from a pulsar can be detected by radio telescopes {{as a series of}} regularly spaced pulses, essentially like the ticks of a clock. Gravitational waves affect the time it takes the pulses to travel from the pulsar to a telescope on Earth. A pulsar timing array uses millisecond pulsars to seek out perturbations due to gravitational waves in measurements of pulse arrival times at a telescope, in other words, to look for deviations in the clock ticks. In particular, pulsar timing arrays can search for a distinct pattern of correlation and anti-correlation between the signals over an array of different pulsars (resulting in the name [...] "pulsar timing array"). Although pulsar pulses travel through space for hundreds or thousands of years <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us,</b> pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to perturbations in their travel time of much less than a millionth of a second.|$|E
2500|$|On November 12, 1970, a Bhola cyclone devastated an area {{of almost}} [...] of East Pakistan's mid-coastal {{lowlands}} and its outlying islands in the Bay of Bengal.

His seeming indifference {{to the plight of}} Bengali victims caused a great deal of animosity. Opposition newspapers in Dhaka accused the Pakistani government of impeding the efforts of international relief agencies and of [...] "gross neglect, callous inattention, and bitter indifference." [...] Mujib, who had been released from prison, lamented that [...] "West Pakistan has a bumper wheat crop, but the first shipment of food grain <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> is from abroad" [...] and [...] "that the textile merchants have not given a yard of cloth for our shrouds." [...] "We have a large army," [...] Mujib continued," [...] but it is left to the British Marines to bury our dead."

We will no longer suffer arbitrary rule by bureaucrats, capitalists, and feudal interests of West Pakistan." ...|$|E
