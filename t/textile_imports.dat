25|$|To {{rescue the}} city's {{manufacturing}} industry, several measures were taken. First, relatively new {{industries such as}} toy, electronics and watches, were developed quickly so that the clothing and textile industries no longer dominated the market. This was also {{due to the fact}} that the Western countries imposed severe restrictions on <b>textile</b> <b>imports,</b> while toys, electronics and watches enjoyed reduced tariffs. In 1972, Hong Kong replaced Japan as the largest exporter of toys. Swiss watch companies also moved some of their factories to Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|One {{contentious}} {{issue is the}} effect which large amounts of Chinese goods are having on local light manufacturing. While the dominant resource extraction industries are largely benefiting from Chinese capital investment, growing imports from China to many African nations underprice and crowd out local suppliers. Though Chinese imports allow poorer consumers to buy their first refrigerator, T-shirt, suitcases, or microwave ovens, they also hurt nascent local industries in countries trying to end reliance on resource commodities. By one interpretation, Chinese <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> have caused 80% of Nigerian factories to shut down, resulting in 250,000 workers losing their jobs.|$|E
25|$|After {{gaining the}} right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the Company largely ceased {{importing}} gold and silver, which it had hitherto {{used to pay for}} goods shipped back to Britain. In addition, as under Mughal Empire rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. Consequently, in the period 1760–1800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardisation of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. During the period, 1780–1860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in—and soon to inundate—the Indian markets, with the value of the <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> growing from £5.2 million 1850 to £18.4 million in 1896. The American Civil War too would {{have a major impact on}} India's cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for Indian cotton soared, and the prices soon quadrupled. This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.|$|E

50|$|The textile {{industry}} has a pivotal {{position in the}} manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In Asia, Pakistan is the eighth-largest exporter of textile products, contributing 9.5% to the GDP and providing employment to around 15 million people (some 30% of the 49 {{million people in the}} workforce). Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5% to the global spinning capacity. China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK <b>textile</b> <b>imports,</b> 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese <b>textile</b> <b>imports,</b> 2.98% or $2.98b of all US <b>textile</b> <b>imports,</b> 1.6% or $0.88bn of total German <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> and 0.7% or $0.888bn of total Indian <b>textile</b> <b>imports.</b>|$|E

50|$|Arapgir was {{the site}} of a {{fascinating}} story of rising <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> and industrial growth as of the 1830s. In 1836, some 1,000 looms in Arapgir were weaving cotton goods from British yarn and by 1907, some 1,200. Durability and color fastness of locally made manusa textile also retained its competitive position. The city grew larger than the province (vilayet) center of Harput and a municipal administration was established in 1883.|$|E

50|$|A {{commonly}} cited legend {{is that in}} {{the early}} 19th century, the East India Company (EIC), had cut off the hands of hundreds of weavers in Bengal in order to destroy the indigenous weaving industry in favour of British <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> (some anecdotal accounts say the thumbs of the weavers of Dacca were removed).

5000|$|In {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, India {{exported}} cotton to Britain, and then reimported the textile. In 1820, the total textile import was valued at Rs. 350,000. However, the cost had escalated significantly by 1860, when <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> stood at Rs. 19.3 million. The impetus towards the founding of a cotton industry came from Indian entrepreneurs. The first Indian cotton mill, [...] "The Bombay Spinning Mill", was opened in 1854 in Bombay by Cowasji Nanabhai Davar. Opposition from the Lancashire mill owners was eventually offset by the support of the British manufacturers of textile machinery.|$|E

50|$|One of King Kyansittha's wives, Abeyadana, is {{believed}} to have originated from Pattikera, a region in the Comilla district of southeast Bengal.

A further sign that there was a cultural exchange between the Pagan Empire and east India/Bengal at the time is that most late 11th and early 12th century temples in Bagan have Bihar or Bengal style painting. One way that stylistic motifs entered Bagan was through <b>textile</b> <b>imports.</b> These textiles were used not just for garments, but also were used for Buddhist shrines.|$|E

The town's roughly 2,500 residents lived in about 750 dwellings and possessed about 445 mature oxen and bulls, 1,354 cattle, and 388 horses. There were 3,335 sheep, a reflection of the prodigious wool business in the town as a result of trade barriers erected by the United States against British <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> that spurred considerable domestic demand for woolen products.|$|E

Prior to 2005, a trade agreement limited <b>textile</b> <b>imports</b> to the European Union and the US. China was exporting US$33.9 billion in textiles and clothing each year to the EU and the US. When those quotas expired on 1 January 2005, the so-called Bra Wars began.

In 1914 {{less than a quarter}} of agricultural produce was being exported the rest being consumed internally. The early 17th century saw trade in Ottoman-made goods in the Damascus province exceeded five times the value of all foreign-made goods sold there. Finally, amongst the sparse internal trade data are some 1890s statistics for three non-leading cities. Their sum value of their interregional trade in the 1890s equaled around 5% of total Ottoman international export trade at the time. Given their minor status, cities like Istanbul, Edirne, Salonica, Damascus, Beirut or Aleppo being far greater than all three, this is impressively high. These major trade centres, dozens of medium-sized towns, hundreds of small towns and thousands of villages remains uncounted - it puts into perspective the size of domestic trade.|$|E
