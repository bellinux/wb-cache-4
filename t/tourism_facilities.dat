5|$|As {{it moved}} ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools {{in dozens of}} villages. In 35villages, the storm {{destroyed}} more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost {{much of what they}} owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged <b>tourism</b> <b>facilities,</b> including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.|$|E
