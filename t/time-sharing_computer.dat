Under Harlan Anderson (vice president of engineering), principal architect Gordon Bell led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer, which developed the first commercial <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer,</b> the PDP-6, designed and delivered in 1963–1964. Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in what may have been the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer</b> that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer</b> system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

In its most narrow and specific meaning, videotex is a subset of online, <b>time-shared</b> <b>computer</b> services.

After obtaining a perfect SAT score of 1600 and graduation, Allen went to Washington State University, where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity, but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston, near where Bill Gates had ended up as well.

40|$|<b>Time-shared</b> <b>computer</b> (or processing) {{facilities}} {{are treated as}} stochastic queueing systems under priority service disciplines, and the performance measure of these systems is taken to be the average {{time spent in the}} system. Models are analyzed in which <b>time-shared</b> <b>computer</b> usage is obtained by giving each request a fixed quantum Q of time on the processor, after which the request is placed {{at the end of a}} queue of other requests; the queue of requests is constantly cycled, giving each user Q seconds on the machine per cycle. The case for which Q ~ 0 (a processor-shared model) is then analyzed using methods from queueing theory. A general time-shared facility is then considered in which priority groups are introduced. Specifically, the pth priority group is given gpQ seconds in the processor each time around. Letting Q [...] > 0 gives results for the priority processor-shared system. These disciplines are compared with the first-come-first-served disciplines. The systems considered provide the two basic features desired in any time-shared system, namely, rapid service for short jobs and the virtual appearance of a (fractional capacity) processor available on a full-time basis. No charge is made for swap time, thus providing results for "ideal" systems. The results hold only for Poisson arrivals and geometric (or exponential) service-time distributions...|$|R

5000|$|By the mid 1960s, growing {{popularity}} of <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer</b> systems that made resources accessible over communications lines created new security concerns. As the scholars Deborah Russell and G. T. Gangemi, Sr. explain, [...] "The 1960s marked the true beginning {{of the age of}} computer security." [...] In June 1965, for example, several of the country's leading computer security experts held one of the first major conferences on system security—hosted by the government contractor, the System Development Corporation (SDC). During the conference, someone noted that one SDC employee had been able to easily undermine various system safeguards added to SDC's AN/FSQ-32 <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer</b> system. In hopes that further system security study would be useful, attendees requested [...] "...studies to be conducted in such areas as breaking security protection in the time-shared system."

50|$|Computer-based {{mail and}} {{messaging}} became {{possible with the}} advent of <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computers</b> in the early 1960s, and informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems.

Many US universities were part of the ARPANET (created in the late-1960s), which aimed at software portability between its systems. That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) increasingly influential.|$|R

5000|$|The {{threat that}} {{computer}} penetration posed was next outlined {{in a major}} report organized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in late 1967. Essentially, DoD officials turned to Willis Ware to lead a task force of experts from NSA, CIA, DoD, academia, and industry to formally assess the security of <b>time-sharing</b> <b>computer</b> systems. By relying on many papers presented during the Spring 1967 Joint Computer Conference, the task force largely confirmed the threat to system security that computer penetration posed. Ware's report was initially classified, {{but many of the}} country's leading computer experts quickly identified the study as the definitive document on computer security. Jeffrey R.
