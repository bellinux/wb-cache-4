50|$|The process seems {{deceptively simple}} but it demanded {{much in the}} way of {{perseverance}} and organisation. Once the theodolite was on a station, signal men were sent to all the other stations that were to be observed from that point, typically five or six stations but as many as 10 in the case of Fairlight Head. For short distances a simple flagstaff would suffice but for the longer sights it was necessary to use lights at night. The brightest lights, so called white lights, were obtained by burning an incendiary mixture that lasted for a short time only. The cross-channel use of these lights entailed careful <b>timing</b> <b>arrangements</b> which could take into account the vagaries of the weather and pocket watches. At many stations, for the theodolite or signals, it was necessary to raise the instrument on a portable tower over 30 ft. high. The tower had two components: an inner frame supported the instrument and the outer supported the observers, thus minimising the disturbance to the instrument.|$|E

Any set of measurements contains a plurality of time interval values, so means are provided for storing a count of the munber of occurrences of each time interval value. Each count {{of the number of}} occurrences of a particular time interval value is stored in a Random Access Memory (RAM) address 70, the address being chosen as immediately adjacent those addresses which store the counts of the number of occurrences of the immediately lower and the immediately higher time interval values.

50|$|Segmentation in the hind-brain and {{paraxial}} mesoderm {{is highly}} {{regulated by the}} expression of the Hox gene. Hox genes encode helix-turn-helix transcription factors and play the major role in specifying the positional identities for tissues along the anterior-posterior axis (A-P axis) during the developmental phase. Humans, like other vertebrates have a total of 39 Hox genes organized into four different clusters. The property of Hox genes called colinerarity, whereby the gene <b>arrangement,</b> <b>timing</b> and the boundaries of expression on the A-P axis are correlated, is instrumental in the development of ordered domains of expression. The Hox gene expression leads to the development of unique combination codes for the different segments that specify their distinct identity. Even though the development of segmentation in the hind-brain and paraxial mesoderm are distinct, the Hox expression in both system are coordinated with the process of morphological segmentation.|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{predominant}} synthetic attributes {{and the overall}} electronic aesthetic, the emphasis placed on organic string arrangements that had accentuated Late Registration remained a significant factor on Graduation. Similar to its predecessor, Graduation wasn't restricted to the confines of conventional looping techniques typical of traditional hip-hop production. Instead, West continues to implement sudden musical shifts within the multi-layered song structures and express meticulously composed introductions, bridges, and codas. For his third album, West produced songs that combine hip-hop beats with anthemic refrains and continues to employ his skill in layering keys, strings, and vocals to coax the melodies out of samples. According to Sean Comer of 411Mania, Graduation is an ambitious album that demonstrates West's attentive ear to the blending of structure, melody, <b>timing,</b> evocative <b>arrangement</b> and their potential to rest comfortably alongside effective samples. Through acting as his own producer, West manages to maintain quality control over the album's music to ensure that [...] "his productions build momentum even when they revolve around a handful of repeated samples [...] nearly every song on Graduation is memorable for both its hooks and its overall sound." [...] And as the album progresses, its textures and the glossy sheen of its polished, synthesizer-driven productions become harder and denser with every track. Under the belief that his sophomore effort had been far too indulgent, poorly arranged, and oversaturated with unnecessary sonic accoutrements, West took measures to streamline his third release. West fashioned Graduation to contain less ornate production, made the studio album completely devoid of hip-hop skits, and sequenced the record {{in such a way}} that it produced a tighter, more cohesive package.|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{activity}} of CA 1 pyramidal neurons alternates between regular spiking and bursting, but how these changes affect information processing remains unclear. Using a detailed CA 1 pyramidal neuron model, we investigate how <b>timing</b> and spatial <b>arrangement</b> variations in synaptic inputs to the distal and proximal dendritic layers influence the information content of model responses. We {{find that the}} temporal delay between activation of the two layers acts as a switch between excitability modes: short delays induce bursting while long delays decrease firing. For long delays, the average firing frequency of the model response discriminates spatially clustered from diffused inputs to the distal dendritic tree. For short delays, the onset latency and inter-spike-interval succession of model responses can accurately classify input signals as temporally close or distant and spatially clustered or diffused across different stimulation protocols. These findings suggest that a CA 1 pyramidal neuron may be capable of encoding and transmitting presynaptic spatiotemporal information about the {{activity of}} the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal network to higher brain regions via the selective use of either a tempora...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsis, the <b>timing</b> {{and spatial}} <b>arrangement</b> of trichome {{initiation}} is tightly regulated and requires {{the activity of}} the GLABROUS 1 (GL 1) gene. The COTYLEDON TRICHOME 1 (COT 1) gene affects trichome initiation during late stages of leaf development and is described in this article. In the wild-type background, cot 1 has no observable effect on trichome initiation. GL 1 overexpression in wild-type plants leads to a modest number of ectopic trichomes and to a decrease in trichome number on the adaxial leaf surface. The cot 1 mutation enhances GL 1 -overexpression-dependent ectopic trichome formation and also induces increased leaf trichome initiation. The expressivity of the cot 1 phenotype is sensitive to cot 1 and 35 S::GL 1 gene dosage, and the most severe phenotypes are observed when cot 1 and 35 S::GL 1 are homozygous. The COT 1 locus is located on chromosome 2 15. 3 cM north of er. Analysis of the interaction between cot 1, try, and 35 S::GL 1 suggests that COT 1 is part of a complex signal transduction pathway that regulates GL 1 -dependent adoption of the trichome cell fate...|$|R
40|$|Filament winding is {{a process}} for the {{placement}} of reinforcement fibres on to a rotating surface in a specified geometric pattern. A conventional straight line interpolation controller is not very appropriate for filament winding because the fibre pay-out-eye is at some distance away from the mandrel surface and its movement from one point to another may disturb the position of previously laid fibre on the mandrel. Filament winding demands a controller which can produce fast and smooth carriage movements, and have a path-anticipation capability so that while moving around curves the effect of pay-out-eye movement on previous fibre positions is minimised. This problem can be overcome by using an interpolation technique which determines the pay-out-eye path by considering more than two data points, and whose profile is continuous in nature up to its second derivative. In this project an IDM PC based filament winding controller, using B-spline interpolation technique, is developed. To test {{the performance of the}} controller a 3 -axis CNC filament winding machine was designed and manufactured. For optimum performance, emphasis was given to the low inertia of the machine carriage, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the system's structural stiffness. To reduce the machine carriage weight, the DC servomotors were installed on the machine's frame, instead of the carriage, and a <b>timing</b> belt <b>arrangement</b> was used for power transmission. The controller's electronic hardware was assembled using servo amplifiers, DAC cards, and a purpose built optical encoder interface card. The controller software was developed using TURBO C++ as the main programming language, whereas the hardware interface routines were written in Assembly Language. Problems of winding path deviation as a result of B-spline approximation were tackled using knowledge based programming techniques. The results showed a considerable improvement in winding speed and less fibre slippage in the case of non-geodesic winding patterns, resulting in higher accuracy of fibre placement on the mandrel...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} into the implications of labour market change for a sample of 500 first time home buyers in South Australia (SA). Increased job insecurity is presumed to be impacting on home ownership aspirations and sustainabilty across all income groups but is largely untested. While Australia {{has one of the}} highest casual employment rates among developed countries, SA stands out within the nation as being the most precarious labour market. SA experienced a net loss of 20, 000 full time jobs in the decade 1990 to 2000 with part time and casual employment the main job growth area. Australia’s welfare and housing polices have been predicated for fifty years on the perceived merits of home ownership. Welfare benefits both during employment and on retirement have been based on household investment being extended over time through home ownership. Thus any significant change in purchaser behaviour particularly in the cohort who would traditionally have entered home ownership as early as possible, merits review. The main research instrument was a postal survey of first time homebuyers who made their purchase during the period 1 st January 1999 to 31 st December 2000. The study area included the Adelaide metropolitan area and the rural townships of Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln. The survey aimed to determine first time buyer profiles including the nature of their employment, their expectations and attitudes to job security, and if and how, this had influenced the <b>timing,</b> location, borrowing <b>arrangements,</b> or nature of their home purchase.

40|$|The {{number of}} Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) {{performed}} will increase dramatically with the upcoming Space Station assembly missions. It {{is estimated that}} up to 900 EVA hours {{may be required to}} assemble the Space Station with an additional 200 hours per year for maintenance requirements. Efficient modeling tools will be essential to assist in planning these EVAS. Important components include strength and fatigue parameters, multi-body dynamics and kinematics. This project is focused on building a model of the EVA crew member encompassing all these capabilities. Phase 1, which is currently underway, involves collecting EMU suited and unsuited fatigue, strength and range of motion data, for all major joints of the body. Phase 2 involves processing the data for model input, formulating comparisons between the EMU suits and deriving generalized relationships between suited and unsuited data. Phase 3 will be formulation of a multi-body dynamics model of the EMU capable of predicting mass handling properties and integration of empirical data into the model. Phase 4 will be validation of the model with collected EMU data from the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at NASA/JSC. Engineers and designers will use tie EVA suit database to better understand the capabilities of the suited individuals. This knowledge will lead to better design of tools and planned operations. Mission planners can use the modeling system and view the animations and the visualizations of the various parameters, such as overall fatigue, motion, timelines, reach, and strength to streamline the <b>timing,</b> duration, task <b>arrangement,</b> personnel and overall efficiency of the EVA tasks.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{exploring}} and understanding important issues concerning the formation process of international strategic alliances of Thai financial enterprises (TFEs). International alliance strategies have been deployed as an important device to stabilise and internationalise a number of TFES. In addition, as the Thai financial industry has been growing rapidly and changing {{over the past few}} decades, the industry was chosen as representative of an industry that is dynamic and in a period of transformation. The study focuses on TFEs' international strategic alliances that had been established up to the end of 1996. This period is considered to be the introductory and growth stages of the Thai financial industry. The main context of the research involves the formation stage of international alliances of Thai financial enterprises, comprising motives, criteria, and the timing of alliance development. The motives and underlying reasons stimulating international alliances, major considerations in foreign partner selection, and the strategic <b>timing</b> of alliance <b>arrangements</b> {{lie at the heart of}} the research. Moreover, co-operative performance of the alliances also supplements the above issues. The final conclusions of the thesis are drawn from a comparative analysis of the quantitative and qualitative approaches. The empirical data obtained from both surveys and case study research are cross-examined and discussed. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. Thai financial enterprises (TFEs) seemed to pay significant attention to both major aspects of alliance motives, including opportunistic (offensive) and risk-concerned (defensive) approaches. In greater detail, these motives are composed of market-defensive motives, resource-defensive motives, market-offensive motives, and resource-defensive motives. This was due to intense competitive pressures from both domestic and foreign markets as well as the increasingly unpredictable demand conditions in the industry. However, as the economic performance of the Thai financial industry had been prosperous for decades and the long-term view of the industry remained promising, TFEs' cross-border alliances were also aimed at acquiring and utilising partners' resources as well as further advancing their market and operational scope...|$|R
40|$|Predators {{are thought}} to reduce travel speed and {{increase}} turning rate in areas where resources are relatively more abundant, a behavior termed ‘‘area-restricted search. ’’ However, evidence for this is rare, and few empirical data exist for large predators. Animals exhibiting foraging site fidelity could also be spatially aware of suitable feeding areas based on prior experience; changes in movement patterns might therefore arise from the anticipation of higher prey density. We tested the hypothesis that regions of area-restricted search were associated with a higher number of daily speed spikes (a proxy for potential prey encounter rate) and foraging success in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), a species exhibiting both area-restricted searches and high interannual foraging site fidelity. We used onshore morphological measurements and diving data from archival tags deployed during winter foraging trips. Foraging success was inferred from in situ changes in relative lipid content derived from measured changes in buoyancy, and first-passage time {{analysis was used to}} identify area-restricted search behavior. Seals exhibited relatively direct southerly movement on average, with intensive search behavior predominantly located at the distal end of tracks. The probability of being in search mode was positively related to changes in relative lipid content; thus, intensively searched areas were associated with the highest foraging success. However, there was high foraging success during the outward transit even though seals moved through quickly without slowing down and increasing turning rate to exploit these areas. In addition, the probability of being in search mode was negatively related to the number of daily speed spikes. These results suggest that movement patterns represent a response to prior expectation of the location of predictable and profitable resources. Shelf habitat was 4 – 9 times more profitable than the other habitats, emphasizing the importance of the East Antarctic shelf for this and other predators in the region. We have provided rare empirical data with which to investigate the relationship between predator foraging strategy and prey encounter/ foraging success, underlining the importance of inferring the <b>timing</b> and spatial <b>arrangement</b> of successful food acquisition for interpreting foraging strategies correctly.

40|$|Understanding the geographic, geologic, and climatic forces {{responsible}} for generating current patterns of biodiversity {{has been a}} central objective of phylogeography. To develop {{a better understanding of}} these processes in the North American arid lands, I used DNA sequence data and species distribution modeling to conduct three phylogeographic assessments incorporating four species of arid-adapted scorpions:Hadrurus arizonensis, H. jedediah, H. spadix,and Paruroctonus becki. In an assessment of H. arizonensis, phylogeographic patterns indicate that Pleistocene climate cycles and associated glacial refugia {{played a central role in}} structuring the genetic diversity of this species in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, mostly supporting predictions from a recent model of historical biotic assembly for these regions. However, the phylogeography of H. arizonensis also revealed a potential glacial refugium along the Lower Colorado River Valley that had not been considered in previous evaluations. To assess the impact that Pleistocene climate fluctuations had in other North American arid lands, I then compared phylogeographic patterns from H. jedediah and H. spadix, to those from H. arizonensis. Since these three species are closely related and morphologically similar, effects from phylogenetic signal and divergent phenotypes should have been minimal, so differences in phylogeographic patterns should reflect the relative influence of Pleistocene climates in different regions. Under this assumption, comparative phylogeography of these three species suggest that the impact of glacial climates was most pronounced for the biotas of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, over those in the Colorado Plateau, and Mohave and Sonoran deserts. Finally, I conducted a phylogeography of P. becki, an unrelated species that spans the Mojave Desert and western Great Basin. Phylogenetic analyses identified five mitochondrial lineages in P. becki. The <b>timing</b> and geographic <b>arrangement</b> of these lineages supports a vicariant origin associated with the tectonically dynamic Eastern California Shear Zone. In association with these deeper patterns, demographic analyses indicated that a lineage in the Great Basin had undergone a recent post-glacial expansion, which according to predictions from climate-based models and a landscape interpolation of genetic distances, probably occurred from refugial areas in the northwest Great Basin. In general, phylogeographic assessments of North American arid land scorpions support phylogeographic inferences from co-distributed organisms, but add a novel glacial refugium in the Mojave Desert and a unique pattern of post-glacial expansions from an area within the Great Basin...|$|R
