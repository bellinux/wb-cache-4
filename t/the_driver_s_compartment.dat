As {{a result of this}} shift, consumer. s need and expectations have changed into a search for new experiences. Companies, in search of satisfying the new expectations of this era. sconsumer, aspire to be innovative. To achieve this, they are concentrate on the user as the main source of innovation and design their products taking into consideration ergonomic, user needs and functionality. Automotive Industries is the one of the most developed and changed industries. Nowadays, especially interior of the automobile has changed with significant development. This paper describes and discusses the approach development aspects, and evoluation phases of a new generation interior design of automobile. The primary interest in <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> <b>s</b> environment is <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> <b>s</b> seat, steering wheel and dashboard location. These are the workstation components that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> required to stay in constand contact with, and the location of these control dictates <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> <b>s</b> posture. Consequently, this study mainly aims to explore the role of user-centered design criterias for design phase and the role of ergonomic and human factors for automobile dashboard design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mobility-pricing {{is one of}} the avenues {{leading to}} the {{information}} highway. Using a combination of positioning, communication and information processing, automobile insurance can be priced based on actual mileage of the vehicle. Vehicle s location is periodically and electronically disclosed to a central server for invoice generation. This raises the possibility of this data being used to reveal <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> identity and social activity. Past research has only been speculative of the motorists privacy perspective. This paper uses mobility-priced insurance as a case study and reports the results of a survey where respondents are asked to indicate their preferred trade-off between location privacy and the setup costs of a hypothetical mobility-priced insurance product. The respondents are also asked about their willingness to reveal location information to various social groups {{as a function of the}} time of day and day of week. It is hoped that the results of this research can be used to influence the design of other mobility-based payment systems.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two complementary {{methods for}} ISA effect assessment, {{and how to}} apply them in a coherent manner. The first level consists of the effects on individual driving behaviour, typically measured with an instrumented vehicle or a driving simulator. Results at this level form {{the starting point for}} the second level, which consists of microscopic traffic flow simulation. ISA system characteristics and behavioural effects should be incorporated in the traffic simulation model. The main focus of the paper is on an explorative case study, in which the MIXIC model was applied to study the effects of a dynamic ISA system. The ISA penetration level was varied as an independent variable. The in-car control unit consisted of a mandatory ISA The road configuration that was studied of consisted of a lane drop from 3 to 2 lanes, and the roadside part of the ISA system determined the actual ISA speed limit based on the traffic state. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> model was adjusted {{to take into account the}} set speed of the in-car ISA system, but otherwise, no strategic changes in driving behaviour were assumed. Results shows a decrease in throughput (volume) combined with positive effects on safety (shock waves, speed variance) when ISA is introduced. For the validation of these results more research into <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> behaviour in <b>the</b> presence of ISA is recommendable...|$|R

40|$|With fast {{rotating}} permanent-magnet {{motors and}} compact battery storage units, the high performance motorsport community has, in recent years, started {{to utilize the}} quick response and high torque of electrical drivetrain solutions. By recovering energy, braking into a corner, for then to utilize the same energy, boosting out again, the electrical machine gives increased performance even for the fastest racing cars. The purpose of the work presented in this Master s thesis is to develop and produce the power electronics and motor control system needed to control such an electric machine, where the final product is used to drive a fully electric prototype racing car. The thesis presents the conceptual work, design choices, prototyping, testing and development of a 2 -level voltage source inverter and motor control system. The voltage source is a battery accumulator energy storage unit, while the machine is a three-phase permanent-magnet motor. The voltage source inverter is based on insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), controlled by a motor control system called field oriented control. On command from <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> throttle, <b>the</b> motor control system generates the required stator currents, giving the wanted output torque, supplied from the voltage source of the battery accumulator. The inverter is the connecting interface between the power source, and the rotating machinery. With {{the amount of energy}} and power needed to drive a racing car, safe and reliable operation is important. To ensure the safety of <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and operating personnel, the system and its safety features have been through extensive testing in a laboratory setup and on the race tracks. In the system development process, simulation and modelling tools have been applied to investigate different solutions and technologies. These tools have also been used to design the electric circuits, program code and mechanical design needed for the system. The final product is installed in a racing car and shows great performance...|$|R

We digested 2  µg each of <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and tester genomic DNAs separately with RsaI, to obtain short, blunt-ended fragments. The enzyme was removed and the digested tester DNA sample was split into two batches, each of which was ligated with a different, partially complementary adaptor supplied by the manufacturer, in the kit. These adaptors could bind to only one of the ends of the DNA fragments. Two successive hybridizations were then carried out to enrich the sample in tester-specific molecules absent from the reference genome. The adaptor-bound tester DNA and <b>the</b> RsaI-digested <b>driver</b> DNA were denatured by heating at 98 °C for 2  min, mixed in a 1 : 50 (tester/driver) ratio and renatured by heating at 64 °C for 90  min.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With more legislation being enforced to achieve a reduction in road transport CO 2 emissions, automotive companies are having to research and develop technologies that deliver greener driving. Whilst emissions from passenger vehicles have dropped over recent years, {{there has been an}} increase in emissions from light commercial vehicles (LCVs). The nature of LCV delivery work is a routine of ingress/egress of the vehicle, changing from a standing to a seated posture repetitively throughout the day. One research focus is packaging occupants in to a smaller vehicle space, {{in order to reduce the}} amount of vehicle emissions over its lifecycle. For LCVs, benefits from space saving technology could be an increase in overall loading space (with the same vehicle length) or a reduction in the overall length/weight of the vehicle. Furthermore, an elevated seat posture could reduce <b>the</b> strain on <b>drivers</b> during ingress/egress, as it is closer than that of a conventional seat to a standing posture. Whilst space saving technology has obvious benefits, current driving conventions and standards are not inclusive of new and novel seated postures when packaging a driver in to a vehicle. The fundamental purpose of a vehicle <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> seat is to be comfortable and safe for the occupant and to facilitate driving. It has been shown that a seat needs both good static and dynamic factors to contribute to overall seat comfort. Additionally, comfortable body angles have been identified and ratified by studies investigating comfortable driving postures; however, this knowledge only applies to conventional driving postures. For an elevated posture, defined as having <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> knee point below the hip point, there is little research or guidance. The overall aim of this thesis is to identify the ergonomic requirements of a wide anthropometric range of drivers in an elevated driving posture for LCVs, which was investigated using a series of laboratory based experiments. An iterative fitting trial was designed to identify key seat parameters for static comfort in an elevated posture seat. The results showed that in comparison with a conventional seat: Seat base length was preferred to be shorter (380 mm compared with 460 mm); Seat base width was preferred to be wider (560 mm compared with 480 mm); Backrest height was preferred to be longer (690 mm compared with 650 mm). These findings provided a basis for a seat design specification for an elevated posture concept seat, which was tested in two subsequent laboratory studies. A long-term discomfort evaluation was conducted, using a driving simulator and a motion platform replicating real road vibration. Discomfort scores were collected at 10 -minute intervals (50 -minutes overall) using a body map and rating scale combination. The results indicated that in comparison with the conventional posture, the elevated posture performed as well, or better (significantly lower discomfort for right shoulder and lower back; p< 0. 05, two-tailed), in terms of long-term discomfort. Furthermore, the onset of discomfort (i. e. the time taken for localised discomfort ratings to be significantly higher than the baseline ratings reported before the trial) occurred after as little as 10 minutes (conventional posture) and 20 minutes (elevated posture) respectively. A lateral stability evaluation was conducted using low-frequency lateral motion on a motion platform (platform left and right rolls of 14. 5 °). Stability scores were reported after each sequence of rolls, comparing scores on a newly developed lateral stability scale between three seats: Conventional posture seat; Elevated posture concept seat (EPS 1); Elevated posture concept seat with modifications aimed at improving stability (EPS 2). Participants reported being more unstable in EPS 1, compared with the conventional posture seat (p< 0. 05, Wilcoxon). However, the EPS 2 seat performed equally to the conventional posture seat. These findings suggest that the elevated posture seat developed in this research is a feasible and comfortable alternative to a conventional posture seat. Furthermore, the final elevated seating positions showed that real space saving can be achieved in this posture thus allowing for more compact and lighter vehicles and potentially reducing strain on drivers during ingress/egress...|$|R

A {{test system}} for {{geothermal}} parameters is designed with S 3 C 2440, {{it is an}} embedded system which can friendly display the test values and geothermal parameters in real time. The test theory is based on heat balance principle. A heater produce heat to induce into the ground through U buried tube. When equilibrated, {{the heat from the}} heater is equal to the heat taken away by ground. The heat taken away by ground is measured by testing the temperatures of two ends of U buried tube and the water velocity flowing through tube; the real produced heat by heater is measured by testing the current and voltage of heater. The heat power can be changed by controlling solid-state relay with PWM. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> programs in <b>S</b> 3 C 2440 for the testing sensor of temperature, current, voltage, water flow and PWM are designed with Linux; the testing values are real displayed and can be saved which interface is designed with OSS QT 4.

Lastovicka and Krizan (2006) indicated possibility of change of trends in the dynamics in the northern midlatitude middle atmosphere as a whole in the 1990 s.

Several theoretical results are then econometrically tested using a novel data set on activities to reduce CO 2 emissions for the case of vehicle purchases in the U. S. and Germany. We show that an increased environmental preference triggers the use of CO 2 offsetting and mitigation channels in both countries. However, we find strong country differences for the purchase of CO 2 offsets.
