5|$|Cook {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>sickness</b> to polluted drinking water, {{and ordered}} {{that it be}} purified with lime juice, but this had little effect. Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.|$|E
5|$|Between 1818 and 1821, the {{structure}} was repaired {{and used as}} an artillery quarter during the War of Independence. It was later used as a magazine for the storage of gunpowder and ammunition in 1830; two years later, it functioned as barraks and armory. By 1899, the facility serviced as headquarters, and after receiving further repairs under instructions from the president Cipriano Castro in 1901, it served as quarters for the National Army. <b>The</b> <b>sickness</b> and eventual death of president Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935 led to the abandonment of the castle by the troops. Later in 1955, and due to a local initiative, the castle achieved the status of War Museum. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965 by president Raúl Leoni.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. <b>The</b> <b>sickness</b> {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, {{including}} an old woman whom he waved to. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E
5|$|In October 1887, Riley and the {{association}} joined with other writers to petition the United States Congress {{to attempt to}} negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad. The group {{became known as the}} International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts. When traveling to one of the league's meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by Bell's palsy. He recovered after three weeks, but remained secluded to hide the effects of <b>the</b> <b>sickness</b> which he believed was caused by his alcohol addiction. He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol {{with the help of a}} minister, but again soon returned to his old habit.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed <b>the</b> <b>sickness</b> on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E

As such, The Sensational One's first reign became the shortest reign in the title's history at less than one day, until September 9, 2006 when Sonjay Dutt defeated SeXXXy Eddy at CZW's Chri$ Ca$h Memorial Show ndash& Down With <b>The</b> <b>Sickness</b> 2 event to become the new champion.

5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes <b>the</b> <b>sickness</b> of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of <b>the</b> <b>sickness.</b> Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E

40|$|In 1998 <b>the</b> Swedish {{national}} <b>sickness</b> {{insurance policy}} changed to allow additional compensation from e. g. collective agreements after the 90 th day of absence without {{a reduction of}} <b>the</b> public <b>sickness</b> benefit.

After the change in policy, this group received 10 percentage points additional compensation during day 91 to 360 in a sick leave. The results indicate that durations of at least 91 days increased by 4. 7 days on average. As a consequence, the cost for <b>the</b> national <b>sickness</b> insurance increased by 3. 0 percent.
