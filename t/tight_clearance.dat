50|$|In robotics, a Remote Center Compliance, Remote Center of Compliance or RCC is a {{mechanical}} device that facilitates automated assembly by preventing peg-like objects from jamming {{when they are}} inserted into a hole with <b>tight</b> <b>clearance.</b> In a naive design without an RCC, a robot might pick up a peg with its gripper, center the peg over the hole and then push the peg along the axis of the hole. If the peg is perfectly aligned and centered, it would then slide into the hole. However if the peg's alignment or centering is slightly off, the peg contacts {{one side of the}} hole first and the peg's tip experiences a lateral force. As the robot's gripper is not perfectly stiff, the peg will tend to rotate about an axis in the plane of the gripper's fingers, called the center of compliance. Such a rotation further misaligns the peg, increasing the lateral force and causing more rotation, resulting in a jam that prevents the insertion from being completed.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{delivery}} {{to a commercial}} operator, an A320neo to Lufthansa, occurred on January 20, 2016. This was instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different thermal deformation of the shaft material, causing the rotor axis to bend; this results in an offset between {{the center of gravity}} of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil diffuser assembly had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil diffuser assembly was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|E

40|$|Pedestal {{looseness}} and rub-impact are {{two important}} faults in rotating machinery. Once the Pedestal looseness is {{developed in a}} rotor system, the rotor {{is more likely to}} make contact with stator under <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> conditions. Due to the presence of both Pedestal looseness and rub-impact, the whole system becomes highly nonlinear and instability. The present study is aimed to simulate a chaotic system of the nonlinear rotor system and the system can adaptively be converted to normal working state under the circumstance of the chaotic state occasioned by outside perturbation for the complicated chaotic system. The nonlinear dynamic equations of rotor-bearing system with coupling faults of pedestal looseness and rub-impact force are derived and a multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm is given. As a result, it is found that those systems possess various nonlinear dynamical inherences. The numerical results also show that the parametric adaptive control method is appropriate to those rotor-bearing systems, outside interference under the state of chaos arising from the situation can be adaptive to adjust to normal working condition. It has strongly control capability of stability. The theoretical and practical idea for controlling rotor–bearing systems and optimizing their operation can be more precise. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of aircraft gas turbine engines {{is sensitive to}} {{the distance between the}} tips of its turbine blades and its shroud, which serves as its containment structure. Maintaining tighter clearance between these components has been shown to increase turbine efficiency, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce the turbine inlet temperature, and this correlates to a longer time-on-wing for the engine. Therefore, there is a desire to maintain a <b>tight</b> <b>clearance</b> in the turbine, which requires fast response active clearance control. Fast response active tip clearance control will require an actuator to modify the physical or effective tip clearance in the turbine. This paper evaluates the requirements of a generic active turbine tip clearance actuator for a modern commercial aircraft engine using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (C-MAPSS 40 k) software that has previously been integrated with a dynamic tip clearance model. A parametric study was performed in an attempt to evaluate requirements for control actuators in terms of bandwidth, rate limits, saturation limits, and deadband. Constraints on the weight of the actuation system and some considerations as to the force which the actuator must be capable of exerting and maintaining are also investigated. From the results, the relevant range of the evaluated actuator parameters can be extracted. Some additional discussion is provided on the challenges posed by the tip clearance control problem and the implications for future small core aircraft engines...|$|E

Bearing is one of important part in mechanical devices. A complete bearing consist of outer ring, steel ball, cage, metallic shield and inner ring. The dimensions of the bearing components are must control tight to its tolerance to ensure the bearing fit to its clearance. To ensure the process is under the production control statistical process control (SPC) methods are being used. To converge the study on SPC application on the bearing manufacturing processes, a visit to SKF Bearing Industries (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. has been made. The case study was done on bearing product number 6206 - 2 Z. The bearings outer ring manufacturing processes were take into consideration.

40|$|Research is {{underway}} {{to explore the}} feasibility of reconstructing human manipulation skills in complex constrained motion by tracing and learning the manipulation performed by the operator. The approach consists of two major steps. In the first step the constraints acquired from operator’s trajectory is generalised as manipulation skills. In the second step, the manipulation skills are transformed to a robotic trajectory to perform the task. Operator’s trajectory is recorded from a haptic-rendered virtual environment. Proxy algorithm which is used in haptic collision detection has been developed and applied to the physical model of the process. In this work a six degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) haptic device called PHANToM Premium 1. 5 and the haptic rendering package Reachin API along with VRML and Python are used to construct the virtual haptic manipulation. The concept is studied based on the gear assembly process which represents a typical constrained motion force sensitive manufacturing task with the attendant issues of jamming, <b>tight</b> <b>clearance,</b> {{and the need for}} quick mating times. In the developed system, a human operator demonstrates both good and bad examples of the desired behaviour in the haptic virtual environment.

The captured data is pre-processed offline to remove noise which primarily consists of wrong or irrelevant manipulation steps. Noise data is removed in the process of analysis. Optimum data is generalized after analysis and locally weighted regression (LWR) is employed in discovering constraints of the controller’s skill.
