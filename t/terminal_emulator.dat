5|$|Seeing {{a growing}} {{business}} in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator</b> system in 1993, {{and used it}} {{as the basis for}} the initial version of its WinComm online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software.|$|E
5|$|William Chalmers invented Plexiglas while a {{graduate}} student at McGill. In computing, MUSIC/SP, software for mainframes once popular among universities and colleges around the world, was developed at McGill. A team also contributed to the development of Archie, a pre-WWW search engine. A 3270 <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator</b> developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software. A team has developed digital musical instruments in the form of prosthesis, called Musical Prostheses.|$|E
25|$|PCBoard also {{supports}} ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and Telnet access via the Internet. The open source <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator</b> SyncTERM, available for Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X {{can be used}} for example to connect to the few remaining PCBoard BBS installations that are connected to the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Unisys {{developed}} the INFOConnect <b>terminal</b> <b>emulators</b> for PCs that included {{use of the}} Uniscope protocols in the early 1990s. There continue to be vendors that sell <b>terminal</b> <b>emulators</b> for these machines.|$|R

50|$|The SHY {{character}} {{is also being}} used in text where paragraphs have already been broken into lines, such as certain plain text files, text sent to VT100-style <b>terminal</b> <b>emulators</b> or printers, or pages represented in page description languages. This is the application context originally considered by the EBCDIC and ISO 8859-1 standards and implemented in many VT100 <b>terminal</b> <b>emulators.</b>|$|R
25|$|The user interface, {{also known}} as the shell, is either a {{command-line}} interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is commonly available through <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator</b> windows or on a separate virtual console.|$|E
25|$|VS {{connectivity}} was via an ISA based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS <b>Terminal</b> <b>Emulator,</b> over an IPX-based Ethernet connection. Originally the PC-240 {{came with}} a Wang specific Hercules Graphics Card and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, meaning the base unit could be kept {{some distance from the}} screen. This was later replaced with an EGA card and screen.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to use console redirection (either by specifying an alternative console device like [...] when initially invoking COMMAND.COM or by using CTTY later on) to direct output to and receive input from a dumb terminal or another computer running a <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator.</b> Assuming the System BIOS still permitted the machine to boot (which {{is often the case}} at least with BIOSes for embedded PCs), the video card could then be removed completely, and the system could provide a total of 960KB of continuous DOS memory for programs to load.|$|E

50|$|A <b>{{terminal}}</b> <b>emulator,</b> terminal application, or term, is {{a program}} that emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture. Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term terminal covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A <b>terminal</b> <b>emulator</b> inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window.|$|E
