25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{physical}} design flow is Floorplanning. Floorplanning is the process of identifying structures that should be placed close together, and allocating space for them in such a manner as to meet the sometimes conflicting goals of available space (cost of the chip), required performance, and the desire <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> close to everything else.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of the lottery, the townspeople gather close to 10 a.m. in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> done in time for lunch. First, the heads of the {{extended}} families draw slips until every family has a slip. Bill Hutchinson gets the one slip with a black spot, meaning that his family has been chosen. The second round would ordinarily be to select one household within the family, but since there is only one Hutchinson household (Bill's adult sister and daughter are counted with their husbands' families), the second round is skipped.|$|E
500|$|The Canadians {{decided that}} the new {{laboratory}} should be located in Montreal, where housing accommodation was easier to find than in wartime Ottawa. They hoped <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> ready by 1 January 1943, but negotiations for laboratory space fell through. A search then commenced for an alternative location. Bertrand Goldschmidt, a French scientist who was already in Canada, ran into Henri Laugier, a French biologist who had been president of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique before the Fall of France, when he had escaped to Canada. Laugier suggested that they acquire some unused wings of a new building at the Université de Montréal, where he was now teaching. These had been earmarked for a medical school, but had never been equipped {{due to a lack}} of funds. The [...] space was acquired, but considerable work was required to convert it into a laboratory, and it could not be made ready before mid-February 1943. Ernest Cormier, the university architect, drew up the plans.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... to have nothing and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything,</b> to be happy with the happy people and to be sad with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am Münsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E
500|$|Horrible Histories was immediately, {{and almost}} universally, greeted with {{critical}} enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of The Independent described {{the show as}} [...] "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." [...] Harry Venning in The Stage approved the [...] "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" [...] along with [...] "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." [...] By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of The Daily Telegraph characterised the first series as [...] "boundary-pushing", suggesting that [...] "the bold decision to approach the series {{in the same way}} as an adult show has been the key to its success... delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." [...] James Delingpole in The Spectator likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that [...] "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effect—bizarrely—is one of dumbing up rather than down." [...] Discussing the first two series in The Guardian, television writer Jesse Armstrong said that [...] "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. You need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> just right—that's what's so terrifying. But Horrible Histories has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. The tone is perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started on}} August 13, 1963, with an {{elaborate}} ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges {{anchored in the}} St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a front-end loader to dump the first batch of fill to enlarge Saint Helen's Island, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% {{was coming from the}} Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal. The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) {{to reduce the amount of}} fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of Notre Dame Island and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cité du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the critical path method (CPM). [...] On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.|$|E

He now no longer made any pretence of not drinking his wine, for he was thirsty, and there was no more water, and he hated to ask for any. The ice-cream came, and then the fruit. Suddenly Mrs. Corey rose, and said across the table to her husband, [...] "I suppose you will want your coffee here." [...] And he replied, [...] "Yes; we'll join you at tea." ...|$|R

This is why I love Ovations. They are very powerful-sounding guitars, and when I hit those strings, they ring with a nice, clear, percussive – but not overly bright – sound that highlights the rhythms I like to play." [...] She has played Stratocaster and Gibson electric guitars. For her 2012–13 tour, she performed on six- and 12-string Ovations and customised Tom Anderson guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{his fame}} and character, Sir Gilbert Parker flattered the American press with eloquent words and compliments. [...] He called the Americans [...] "fighting people".

[...] His writings essentially [...] "educated" [...] the one source that he knew would reach the majority of Americans. [...] However, he didn't stop there: [...] he continued to spread his [...] "knowledge" [...] by distributing [...] "propaganda material" [...] to American libraries, educational institutions, and periodicals. [...] While focusing on professional establishments he continued to create personal relationships with American elites such as college professors, scientists, doctors, politicians, etc. His method of establishing personal relationships was a landmark later used in other methods of propaganda, [...] "it was the complete and skillful technique later to be developed by many other propagandists, lobbyists, and public relations council." ...|$|E
