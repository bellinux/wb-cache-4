5|$|The militia {{garrison}} {{artillery and}} engineers were required throughout the war, however, to man the coastal defences. Despite {{the fact that}} after 1915 {{it was decided that}} only small garrisons were required on active service, the militia was ordered to maintain their readiness in case they were required to be called out and such was the importance placed upon their role <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large extent they were barred from joining the AIF for overseas service. In February 1916 a large-scale effort by militia artillerymen to enlist in the artillery units that were being raised for the 3rd Division was prevented when they were called out to man the coastal defences due to the threat posed by a German commerce raider that was believed to be in the Pacific. This mobilisation lasted until April 1916, when the garrisons were again reduced and the ban on men serving in militia artillery and engineer units volunteering for overseas service was lifted.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Manheim Auctions {{moved back}} to {{full-time}} sponsorship, and Phil Parsons was hired to drive. Parsons finished 8th at North Carolina Motor Speedway, but was released in the final {{part of the year}} as Dick Trickle took his place, and had an outside-pole starting spot at the Slick 50 500, then followed it up with a fifth-place finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway. After Trickle left {{at the end of the}} year, LHM signed 1992 Busch Series champion Joe Nemechek to compete for Rookie of the Year, sponsored by Meineke, for 1994 Nemechek had two consecutive top-five qualifying runs and finished 3rd at Pocono Raceway. When they were unable to clinch the rookie crown, Nemechek left to run his own team, and Hedrick signed another Busch Series veteran to compete for Cup rookie honors, Ricky Craven, as well as Kodiak as a sponsor. They had one top-five and four top-tens, defeating Robert Pressley for Rookie of the year. Craven was rewarded with a share of ownership in the Hedrick operation, and responded with two pole positions and five top-tens in 1996. He ran up near the top of the points standings very early in the season, but suffered a horrific crash at the Winston Select 500. Although he survived with no major injuries, his performance slipped after that, and many attribute <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of confidence following that wreck. Craven left for Hendrick Motorsports at the end of the 1996 season.|$|E

In the opening drive, Aggie running back Christine Michael fumbled the ball at the Oklahoma 47-yard line and it was picked up by Oklahoma's Brian Jackson and returned 52yards for a touchdown. Later in the first quarter, WR Ryan Broyles rushed 25yards for a second Sooner touchdown. A's next possession began on the 40-yard line and ended with a field goal. Following the kickoff, Landry Jones threw a pass that was tipped and intercepted by A's Michael Hodges, who returned it 28yards to the Oklahoma 6-yard line. A converted <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> touchdown and narrowed the lead. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Oklahoma led 14–10.

Texas A was held scoreless after the first quarter while the Sooners added an additional 23points in the second half. Oklahoma finished the game with 640yards of total offense including 392passing yards, a career-high for Jones. Oklahoma extended their NCAA-leading home winning streak to 29straight games.|$|E

Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female, which is in line with the new strategy of NBC's then-President Kevin Reilly (now at FOX) for selling the show. When questioned about this strategy, he admitted to having regrets about initially marketing the show incorrectly, saying: “It’s been so clear to me that [...] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [...] it was supposed to be". He said he felt the show is, at its core, a “women's show”, and his wish is that the marketing had reflected <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater extent.|$|E
