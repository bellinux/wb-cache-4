500|$|In London, M informs Bond that Romanova has {{contacted}} their [...] "Station 'T'" [...] in Turkey, {{claiming to}} have {{fallen in love with}} Bond from his file photo. She offers to defect to the West, and will bring a top secret Lektor with her to sweeten the deal - but only on the condition that Bond handle her case, personally. Prior to his departure, Bond is supplied by Q with an attaché case containing a concealed <b>throwing</b> <b>knife,</b> gold sovereigns, a special tear gas booby trap connected to the lock mechanism and ammunition for an Armalite AR-7 folding sniper rifle with an infrared night scope.|$|E
500|$|Director Terence Young's eye for realism {{was evident}} {{throughout}} production. For the opening chess match, Kronsteen wins {{the game with}} a re-enactment of Boris Spassky's victory over David Bronstein in 1960. Production Designer Syd Cain built up the [...] "chess pawn" [...] motif in his $150,000 set for the brief sequence. Cain also later added a promotion to another movie Eon was producing, making Kirilenko's death happen inside a billboard for Call Me Bwana. A noteworthy gadget featured was the attaché case (briefcase) issued by Q Branch. It had a tear gas bomb that detonated if the case was improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a <b>throwing</b> <b>knife,</b> and 50 gold sovereigns. A boxer at Cambridge, Young choreographed the fight between Grant and Bond along with stunt co-ordinator Peter Perkins. The scene took three weeks to film and was violent enough to worry some on the production. Yet Robert Shaw and Connery did most of the stunts themselves.|$|E

2500|$|January Jones plays Emma Frost/White Queen in , {{released}} by Fox on June 3, 2011. She {{is a powerful}} telepath as well as possessing her diamond skin, and is the consort of Sebastian Shaw, the villainous leader of the Hellfire Club who seeks to start a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. This would eradicate all non-mutant life and mutate any survivors, leaving the Hellfire Club to rule over this new world order. Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr, and their team of teenage mutants thwart their plan, and Emma is incarcerated, though she is freed by Erik, who {{is now known as}} Magneto, {{at the end of the}} film. In this film, she is able to completely block Xavier from using his telepathy on her and Shaw, create illusions, perform mental torture, as well as sense the initial activation of Cerebro from thousands of miles away. While in diamond form, she shows absolute immunity towards psychic attack and has enhanced strength, durability, and reflexes, able to easily cut through glass and glacial ice, catch a <b>throwing</b> <b>knife,</b> and punch Magneto off a boat and into the sea. However, Erik uses his powers to choke her with a metal bar to get information out of her while in her diamond form. This caused massive cracks in her body while in that form, and after she reverts to flesh and blood, he implies a single tap should be enough to shatter her completely should she morph.|$|E
