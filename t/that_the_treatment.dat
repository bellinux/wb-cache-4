5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{a working}} party was {{established}} {{to look at the}} management of the Kaimanawa herd. They aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management, to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of horses is humane, to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds, and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities. Goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses, protecting natural ecosystems and features that the Kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level. Ecological objectives included ensuring that Kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered, rare and biogeographically significant plants; ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives; and preventing the herd from spreading into the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the Tongariro National Park. Herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses, while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses; reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses; and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging.|$|E

40|$|Giant Panda {{waste was}} used as a source for {{isolation}} of lignocellulosic fibres and its subsequent characterization was done. Non-cellulosic components such as lignin, hemicellulose, and pectin were removed from the fibres by subsequently washing, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) treatment. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed that there were no significant variations in peak positions, signifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> did not affect the chemical structure of the fibres. The difference in peak intensity in treated fibres compared to untreated fibres indicated that hemicellulose and impurities on the fibre surfaces are partly removed by NaOH and NaOCl treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural structure of cellulose I polymorph was maintained irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b> X-ray analyses also showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatments</b> altered <b>the</b> crystallinity of the fibres where the bleached fibres had a higher crystallinity (28. 62 %) than that of untreated fibes (27. 60 %).

25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E
