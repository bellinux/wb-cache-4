40|$|ABSTRACT: A newly {{designed}} crevice mockup support module {{was used in}} a study by seven labs to evaluate lab-to-lab and operator-to-operator variability on ignitions in the flat and crevice configurations. Two commercial upholstery fab-rics and two experimental cigarettes were used in the study. The two cigarettes were tested in flat configurations with one fabric, and one cigarette was <b>tested</b> in the <b>crevice</b> configuration with the second fabric. Results from this preliminary study showed that lab-to-lab variability for the crevice configuration and for one of the flat configurations was not statistically significant. Operator-to-operator variability for the flat configurations in the seven labs was not statistically signifi-cant. However, for the crevice configuration operator-to-operator variability was statistically significant for three of the seven labs. This study showed that using a {{newly designed}} mockup support system, <b>crevice</b> <b>testing</b> can be performed in many labs with low lab-to-lab variability. In this ini-tial trial, operator-to-operator variability for the crevice configuration was lower than expected.

By measuring the impedance with a special sensor {{in the size of}} a bur handpiece, it allows a quick determination of the corrosion resistance. For the evaluation of the method, measurements were done on six conventional dental alloys (two precious alloys, one Pd-based alloy and three non-precious alloys) which had been <b>tested</b> in <b>crevice</b> corrosion by the authors in an earlier stage.

40|$|Carbon steel samples {{coated with}} a base-coat of AMC 4302 and a top-coat of AMC 3201 passed both the {{cathodic}} disbondment (ASTM G 42) and the galvanic corrosion tests in simulated saline environments. The porosity levels determined in coatings applied using the ArcMelt® Company AMC 3201 / 4302 system is less than 5 %.

The coating system, however, failed the <b>crevice</b> corrosion <b>test</b> due to the microclimate generated under the fictitious crevice imposed on the coating surface as specified in the ASTM G 78 Standard <b>test</b> protocol. <b>Crevice</b> corrosion seems to have been related to the preferential dissolution of the metal matrix in both the top and the base coat under the acidic crevice microclimate with the predominant formation of Cr-chlorides and Ni-chlorides in the top and base coat, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Aqueous {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} Fe 3 Al-based iron aluminides were investigated. From {{the result of}} cyclic anodic polarization tests conducted in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution at 25, 48, 72 and 95 °C, as the temperature increased, the resistance to pitting corrosion decreased significantly, especially over the range of 25 ~ 48 °C. From the result of <b>crevice</b> corrosion <b>tests,</b> no <b>crevice</b> corrosion occurred on FAL-Mo in the lower chloride-containing solution (200 ppm Cl), however, FAL-Mo did not perform {{as well as the}} 304 L SS in the higher chloride-containing solution (3. 5 wt. % NaCl). From the result of anodic polarization tests performed in sulfur-compound solutions, additions of Cr and Mo to the Fe 3 Al-based iron aluminides tend to improve the aqueous corrosion resistance.

In these extreme environments, localized corrosion occurred by pitting even though specimens were <b>tested</b> using artificial <b>crevice</b> formers.

40|$|AbstractNi-Cr-Mo alloys show a {{remarkable}} corrosion resistance {{in a wide}} variety of environments. These alloys are candidate materials for the corrosion resistant engineered barriers of nuclear repositories. Ni-Cr-Mo alloys are susceptible to crevice corrosion in aggressive conditions, such as high concentrations of chlorides, low pH and high temperatures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of electrochemical noise technique to the study of crevice corrosion of alloy 22. Potential and current noise records were obtained from alloy 22 samples with and without crevice formers in several corrosive environments. The obtained records were analyzed in the time domain, and through statistical parameters. The objective of this analysis was to obtain confident parameters to detect crevice corrosion. Noise records obtained from <b>tests</b> where <b>crevice</b> corrosion occurred showed a clear drop in potential along with an increase of current. On the contrary, in the cases where there was no crevice corrosion, only a gradual increase in the potential is observed in the noise potential records. Analyses over statistical parameters of the records show that the current noise standard deviation is sensitive to the corrosiveness of the environment (temperature and solution composition) and to the occurrence of crevice corrosion. The results indicate that, within electrochemical noise technique, the voltage drop and the simultaneous increase in the current record are the most important parameters for monitoring crevice corrosion of alloy 22. The analysis of the standard deviation of the current records may complement these measurement...|$|R
40|$|Even {{apparently}} subtle disturbance to habitat {{may have}} severe long-term consequences if that disturbance alters specific microhabitat features upon which animals depend. For example, in south-eastern Australia, the endangered broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides and its prey (velvet geckos Oedura lesueurii) shelter in narrow crevices beneath sun-warmed rocks. Humans frequently displace rocks while searching for snakes and lizards, and these reptiles are rarely found under such displaced rocks (even when the rocks superficially appear suitable). We quantified disturbance to rock outcrops {{and show that}} most disturbance was subtle (rocks were typically displaced < 30 cm from their original position), but that disturbed rocks harbored fewer reptiles than undisturbed rocks. In a field experiment, we replaced half of the rocks back to their original positions to <b>test</b> whether <b>crevice</b> structure and microclimates differed between disturbed and restored rocks. Crevices beneath displaced rocks were larger and cooler than those beneath restored rocks, and precise repositioning of rocks enhanced usage by reptiles. Both crevice size and temperature influence reptile retreat-site selection; hence, minor displacement of overlying rocks reduces habitat quality by modifying critical crevice attributes. The subtlety of this disturbance suggests that even well-intentioned researchers could damage habitat during field surveys. Conservation of rock outcrop systems requires efforts to reduce rock disturbance, and to educate those searching for animals beneath rocks {{about the importance of}} replacing rocks properly. Encouragingly, if rocks are not completely removed, disturbed outcrops can be quickly and easily restored by returning displaced rocks to their original locations...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{tests were}} performed on alloy 22 in chloride and chloride plus inhibitor naturally aerated solutions, at 90 ◦C. A R-(RF//CPE) equivalent circuit model was used for fitting to the EIS data. R and RF were the ohmic and film resistances, respectively, and CPE accounted for the non-ideal capacitance. The fitting errors of the circuit parameters decreased as pH increased. The passive film properties improved as pH increased from pH 0 to pH 4. At higher pH values, the passive film properties depended mainly on {{the identity of the}} salt added. Oxalic, picric and citric acids additions were detrimental for the passive film developed on alloy 22. Carbonate and bicarbonate led to less protective passive films only when added to 1 M NaCl solutions. Fluoride was a detrimental addition at pH 6, but not at pH 9. Acetic acid, carbonic acid, silicate, tungstate, and molybdate additions did not modify significantly the protective properties of the alloy 22 passive film. Nitrate, sulfate and chromate additions led to thick and protective passive films. The efficiency of the <b>tested</b> species as <b>crevice</b> corrosion inhibitors was not related to their effects on alloy 22 passivity...|$|R
40|$|For sludge washing to be {{conducted}} in existing Hanford carbon steel tanks, {{there must be an}} assurance that the tanks will be safe from failure by pitting, stress-corrosion cracking or other failure processes when the corrosion inhibitors present in the waste are diluted during the sludge washing operation. Testing has been conducted previously to define safe operating regimes in concentrated waste environments and moderately dilute waste environments. Due to identification of unsafe operating regimes for moderately dilute waste environments, testing was conducted in more dilute environments to adequately capture the range of possible chemistries during sludge washing operations. Additionally, a small scoping study was performed to identify the corrosion effects of high levels of chloride in the waste environments. Six month exposure coupon tests, slow strain rate tests, and potentiodynamic scans have been completed on a statistically designed test matrix of twenty-four tests. Stress- corrosion cracking was not found for the specimens in the static tests or the slow strain rate <b>tests.</b> Pitting and <b>crevice</b> corrosion was found for many of the solutions, but primarily in the vapor phase.

40|$|Alloy 22 is {{a nickel}} base alloy highly {{resistant}} to {{all forms of}} corrosion. In very aggressive conditions (e. g. hot concentrated chloride containing brines) Alloy 22 could suffer localized attack, namely pitting and crevice corrosion. The occurrence of localized corrosion in a given environment is governed by {{the values of the}} critical potential (E{sub crit}) for crevice corrosion and the corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) that the alloy may establish in the studied environment. If E{sub corr} is equal or higher than E{sub crit}, localized corrosion may be expected. This paper discusses the evolution of E{sub corr} of Alloy 22 specimens in 5 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 5 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } brines at 100 C and 120 C. Two types of specimens were used, polished as-welded (ASW) creviced and noncreviced specimens and as-welded plus solution heat-treated (ASW+SHT) creviced specimens. The latter contained the black annealing oxide film on the surface. Results show that, for all types of Alloy 22 specimens the E{sub corr} was higher at 120 C than at 100 C, probably because a more protective film formed at the higher temperature. Specimens with the black oxide film on the surface showed more oscillations in the potential. None of the <b>tested</b> specimens suffered <b>crevice</b> corrosion probably because of the relatively high concentration of nitrate in the electrolyte, R = [NO 3]/[Cl] = 1...|$|R

A {{limited number of}} experiments were also performed in a neutral brine involving A 516 steel/alloy C- 22 couple. The steady-state galvanic current and galvanic potential were measured as functions of anode-to-cathode (A/C) area ratio and electrode distance. Results indicate that the galvanic current was gradually reduced as the A/C area ratio was increased. No systematic trend {{on the effect of}} A/C area ratio on the galvanic potential was observed. Also, no significant effect of electrode distance on the galvanic current and galvanic potential was evident. In general, increased galvanic current was noticed with increasing temperature. The limited data obtained in the neutral brine indicate that the galvanic current was reduced in this environment, compared to that in the acidic brine. Optical microscopic examination was performed on all tested specimens to evaluate the extent of surface damage resulting from galvanic interaction.

40|$|Two {{different}} {{tests were}} designed to evaluate the reaction of various polymers and grade- 2 titanium in ozonated seawater {{in conjunction with a}} comparative analysis in an aerated seawater solution. The first was a weight loss test measuring the weight change of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Polyethylene and Teflon{trademark} in both ozonated and aerated artificial seawater baths. The second test was designed to induce crevice corrosion on the titanium test samples using various crevice generating materials in both ozonated and aerated solutions. The materials used to create the crevices were grade- 2 titanium washers, PVC, Polyethylene, Saran and Teflon{trademark}. The weight loss test showed that all three polymers lost weight in the ozonated bath. The results of the titanium washer <b>crevice</b> <b>test</b> provided no indication of corrosion or surface discoloration in either the ozonated or aerated solutions.

The PVC samples in the aerated bath also showed no signs of corrosion, but the PVC samples in the ozonated tank had light brown rings of surface discoloration. One of the ozonated PVC samples did show evidence of chlorine in the corrosion product. The outer circumference of the ozonated PVC washers exhibited the same type bleaching effect as in the weight loss samples, but the whitening of these samples were more pronounced. The polyethylene samples under aeration showed no discoloration or presence of fluorine or chlorine. The polyethylene crevice samples in the ozonated solution all exhibited the distinct brilliant blue color of titanium oxide. Fluorine was found in the corrosion product on only one of the samples.

40|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} {{is a form}} of {{galvanic corrosion}} that occurs when a metal is exposed to different environments. This occurs when the oxygen within the crevice gets depleted, thus acting as the anodic site for metal dissolution reaction. The anodic site thus encourages the migration of Cl- ions into the crevice leading to the development of an aggressive local solution. The acidic conditions present in the crevice reaches a critical crevice solution composition and results in the loss of stability of the passive film which further leads to a rapid breakdown of these films on the metal thus indicating the onset of active corrosion. In this research, it is hypothesized that the onset of crevice corrosion can be detected by measuring the galvanic coupling current between electrodes in a crevice and an external metal surface composed of the same material as the electrodes. To prove this hypothesis an engineered crevice was designed to measure IR controlled crevice currents along the crevice length of AISI 304 stainless steel immersed in a 0. 5 M solution and a 1 M NaCl solution. Varying crevice openings were used to determine the effect of crevice gap (G) on the initiation of crevice corrosion and the position of the accelerated attack within the crevice. Multiplexed corrosion potential measurement and galvanic corrosion measurement techniques were used to measure the change in the open circuit potential (OCP) and the galvanic current for the four channels along the crevice length of the galvanic couple. The results obtained from the MGC test for the 100 µm crevice width immersed in 0. 5 M NaCl solution showed good results with high anodic current at approximately 1 cm from the crevice mouth. This finding was in close agreement with the peak pH value observed at the position closest to the crevice mouth in the work of Alavi and Cottis (1987) and the model prediction of Kennell et al. 2009. However, for <b>test</b> samples with <b>crevice</b> width &# 8805; 200 µm, there was no initiation of crevice corrosion and the results obtained were discarded. The Linear polarization resistance scan and Potentiodynamic polarization scan carried out along the crevice to measure the polarization resistance, Rp, and to obtain the region of passivity along an AISI 304 SS crevice did not yield good results. Low corrosion rate in the range of 0. 06 mm/yr was calculated for the AISI 304 stainless steel crevice...|$|R
40|$|Thermally sprayed {{aluminium}} (TSA) {{is widely}} used for corrosion protection on offshore installations. Rapid degradation of the TSA has earlier been discovered, if organic coating is applied {{on top of the}} TSA. In case of coating damages on the TSA, a duplex corrosion mechanism may occur. Due to access limitations with coating equipment or hot work limitations offshore, application of new TSA may be difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a repair coating for TSA in connection with damage. The repair coating must provide corrosion protection without triggering the duplex corrosion mechanism and shall be applied without removing the intact TSA. Eight repair coatings were tested on steel coated with TSA to determine the corrosion behavior in marine environment. Four possible protection mechanisms were considered: (1) cathodic polarization, (2) buffering capacity, (3) ability to release an aggressive environment formed under the coating and (4) electrical conductive coatings. The coatings contained anodic elements such as aluminium, zinc or magnesium, except for an inorganic copolymer coating and an MgO pigmented coating. A cyclic coating test was conducted for 20 cycles according to ISO 20340. Highest amount of corrosion creep for the TSA was seen for the Zn epoxy, the inorganic copolymer coating, the high Zn primer and the modified Zn epoxy. An average corrosion creep of approximately 5. 1 mm was seen for the Zn epoxy. Due to corrosion products, blistering or cracking of the repair coat were seen for these coatings. The Zn-, MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed promising results without blistering after the same test. The Zn silicate showed an average corrosion creep of approximately 0. 6 mm, while the MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed negligible corrosion creep. Coating resistivity was measured by obtaining several electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over a period of time, and the open circuit potential (OCP) was measured. The zinc containing coatings were exposed for 134 days, while the MgO-, Mg-, Al-silicate and the inorganic copolymer coating were exposed for 81 days. All coatings showed an OCP more negative than - 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, except for the inorganic copolymer coating. This coating had an initial potential of - 430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with decreasing development towards a more negative potential. The coatings that revealed blistering or cracking of the repair coating during the cyclic coating test showed generally higher impedance, compared to the silicate coatings that did not blister. An open coating structure was considered as the most important protection mechanism for a TSA repair coat. The protection mechanisms regarding cathodic polarization, electrical conductive coatings and the buffering effect were assumed less important compared to the open coating structure. <b>Crevice</b> corrosion <b>tests</b> with different <b>crevice</b> designs were performed {{in order to have a}} short-term test for the TSA duplex corrosion mechanism.
