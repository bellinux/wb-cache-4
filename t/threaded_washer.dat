50|$|A {{lock ring}} is a <b>threaded</b> <b>washer</b> {{used to prevent}} {{components}} from becoming loose during rotation. They are found on an adjustable bottom bracket and a track hub of a bicycle. Lokring is another form of fastener used in the automotive and air condition industries. These fittings are often confused with lockrings.|$|E
40|$|A locking {{fastener}} assembly comprising a fastener having a shaft (12) {{and a head}} (14 or 114) and first threads (16) for placing the shaft (12) in tension to clamp a part (18). A <b>threaded</b> <b>washer</b> (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between the head (14 or 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) for urging the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) to rotate in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by the}} first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually rotates the washer (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12). To assemble the components, the hex head (14 or 114) is first torsionally loaded against the washer (20) utilizing the torsional spring (24) such that the components would rotate apart if the pre-load was removed. The hex head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are of the same polygonal (hexagonal) shape and are rotated together with a conventional socket type wrench disposed over both at the same time. The {{locking fastener}} assembly is then tightened as the head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are rotated together or in unison to the desired torque...|$|E

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock <b>washers,</b> <b>thread</b> adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the surgical technique called the “parachute technique, as applied to adult patients who suffered displaced and unstable two or three-part fractures of the proximal humerus, through the clinical outcomes. Methods: Between January 1995 and June 2006, 59 adult patients with displaced and unstable two or three-part fractures underwent operations performed by the Shoulder and Elbow Group of the Orthopedics and Traumatology Service of Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual de São Paulo using the “parachute technique. This method consists of an intramedullary tension band and extramedullary fixation in a figure-of-eight to join the fragments of the fracture, using a 6. 5 -millimeter spongy screw with partial <b>threading,</b> a <b>washer</b> and two non-absorbable wires, thereby producing stable synthesis with minimal aggression to the surrounding soft tissue and not requiring any subsequent removal of material. The final shape of this synthesis {{is reminiscent of the}} shape of an open parachute. The patients had a minimum postoperative follow-up of six months. For the diagnosis, trauma series radiographic views of the shoulder were produced. The fractures were classified in accordance with the system proposed by Neer. We used the scale of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to {{evaluate the}} results. Results: The “parachute technique” produced good results in 47 % and excellent results in 26 % of the cases, according to the UCLA scores. Conclusion: The “parachute technique” is a safe and effective treatment for displaced and unstable two or three-part fractures of the proximal humerus...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the expansion shell or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the expansion shell rock bolts equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the expansion shell rock bolt with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (<b>washer,</b> <b>thread)</b> and the expansion shell head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod). There were two phases of displacement observed during the static tension of the rock bolt which differed in their intensity...|$|R
