5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|The ironic <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that {{we grew up}} {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E

5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E

5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|The Best Damn <b>Thing</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. It was {{released}} on 17 April 2007 by RCA Records. The album represents a musical departure from her earlier studio album Under My Skin (2004) which incorporates more elements of post-grunge music. The Best Damn <b>Thing</b> <b>is</b> seen by critics as Lavigne's most commercial effort. The album was noted as her first effort to feature {{a wide range of}} producers for the studio album, including Matt Beckley, Rob Cavallo, Dr. Luke and Lavigne herself who was referenced as the executive producer.|$|E

50|$|Objection: Holy Scripture {{speaks of}} real {{things such as}} mountains, cities, and human bodies.

5000|$|The idealistic BBC {{motto is}} most likely based on biblical verses from the Book of Micah and the Book of Isaiah: [...] "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.In 1934 the motto was changed to [...] "Quaecunque", meaning [...] "Whatsoever". This was {{inspired}} by St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:8: English (King James Bible):Finally, brethren, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> true, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> honest, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> just, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> pure, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> lovely, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. This inspired the dedication that appears in the entrance hall of Broadcasting House: English:This Temple of the Arts and Muses is dedicated to Almighty God by the first Governors of Broadcasting House in the year 1931, Sir John Reith being Director-General. It is their prayer that good seed sown may bring forth a good harvest, that all things hostile to peace or purity may be banished from this house, and that the people, inclining their ear to whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> beautiful and honest and of good report, may tread the path of wisdom and uprightness.|$|R
