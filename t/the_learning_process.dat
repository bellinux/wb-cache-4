Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process</b> by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim of this}} thesis is to investigate <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in INTERREG projects based on the feedback from different project partners in the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013. Beginning with <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> at <b>the</b> individual level (between project partners) the author examines further the influence of transnational cooperation on <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> within partner’s home organizations. Additionally, the author identifies the main barriers hindering <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> at <b>the</b> both levels. The idea for this research arose from comprehensive literature analysis, which suggested {{that there is still}} a paucity of in-depth empirical studies on <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> in <b>the</b> INTERREG programmes. From a more personal perspective, the inspiration for this thesis derives from the discussions with experts during author’s internship at the Joint Technical Secretariat for the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013 in Rostock. Through empirical analysis, the author identifies several categories which refer to <b>learning</b> at <b>the</b> individual and organizational level. These categories are based on the extensive feedback from interviews with seventeen selected project partners from the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007 - 2013. As an outcome of this dissertation the author wishes to gain a practical understanding of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>processes</b> at <b>the</b> transnational cooperation forum.

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b> Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

However, {{there are some}} boundary conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks.

Similarly, when someone is learning a new task, performance-related goals can distract from <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process,</b> it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result.

25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} the learner or learners {{to arrive at}} his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process,</b> as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>process</b> (Wertsch 1997).|$|E
