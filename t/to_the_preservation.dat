5|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, THSRC {{has been devoted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the pheasant-tailed jacana, a type of bird that is {{considered}} endangered in Taiwan. With NT$50 million invested, the first artificial habitat recovery project was completed {{in collaboration with the}} local government, country development organizations and non-profit organizations. The pheasant-tailed jacana population in Tainan, Taiwan, which at one point numbered less than 50, has increased to over 300. In 2007, the recovery habitat was officially renamed “Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park” and since then, it has opened to the public. To educate students in matters concerning environmental protection, every year THSRC arranges for elementary and junior high school students to visit Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park(台南官田—水雉生態教育園區), where they are able to learn about the beauty of Taiwan’s natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism {{before they can be}} observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 the Museum's Southwark {{building}} {{was extended to}} provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum {{had moved to the}} site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns. One had been mounted on the Royal Navy's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led the museum to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers. This would eventually lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the Royal Navy light cruiser , which became a branch of the museum in 1978.|$|E

30|$|Investigation of <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> {{potential}} presents technical challenges. For example, local {{variation of}} {{the thickness of the}} tsunami deposits, which is observed between the pits of few meters in horizontal scale, caused by undulation of the topography, is an important factor <b>to</b> interpret <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> potential of <b>the</b> deposits. In fact, the tsunami deposit thickness is known to be highly variable with several to several tens of centimeters’ thickness, depending on local undulation (Hori et al., 2007; Fujino et al., 2010; Naruse et al., 2010). <b>To</b> study <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> potential, a pit in the same place as that examined before should be avoided because the deposits were disturbed during prior digging and covered with other soil (Szczuciński, in press), which in turn suggests that it is not possible <b>to</b> study exactly <b>the</b> same pits, although pits in very close proximity should be studied <b>to</b> compare <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> potential and thickness variation. Therefore, local variation in thickness, which is of a few meters in horizontal scale, must be considered <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> potential of tsunami deposits.|$|R

5|$|Nineteenth-century Egyptologists {{studied the}} temples intensively, but their {{emphasis}} was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm. Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased. Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was {{the construction of the}} Aswan High Dam in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed Lake Nasser. A major effort by the United Nations disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and the Egyptian government gave several of the others, such as Dendur, Taffeh, and Debod, as gifts to nations that had contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{survey is}} the most common method of {{monitoring}} giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and should be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. In 2010, giraffes were assessed as Least Concern from a conservation perspective by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the 2016 assessment categorized giraffes as Vulnerable. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Swaziland. Two subspecies, the West African giraffe and the Rothschild giraffe, have been classified as Endangered, as wild populations of each of them number in the hundreds. In 1997, Jonathan Kingdon suggested that the Nubian giraffe was the most threatened of all giraffes; , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of giraffe populations in southern Africa. Giraffe Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E

The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA was brought {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring the expansion of Serbia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of Yugoslavia, threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually replace plans to preserve Yugoslavia with Serbian expansion. By the end of March, the conflict escalated after the first fatalities during an incident at Plitvice Lakes. The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents and preventing the Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia; this was seen by the Government of Croatia as an intention to secede from Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging {{the preservation of the}} walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the area {{currently}} classified a World Heritage Site was under restricted access and protection during the imperial era and has been under some form of legal recognition and protection since French colonization, having been incorporated into the Colony Domains Service in 1897 and the National Inventory in 1939. It has since benefited from legal municipal protection and two national laws (passed in 1982 and 1983) protecting sites of historical and national interest. The Office of the Cultural Site of Ambohimanga (OSCAR), created by the Ministry of Culture, has managed the site and its entrance fees and state subventions since 2006, when a five-year management plan was developed for implementation by the group's 30 employees. These management and conservation activities are conducted {{in cooperation with the}} local population within the Rural Commune of Ambohimanga Rova. The Village Committee, comprising representatives of all the adjacent quarters and the local community, are also involved in the protection of the site. Conservation of Ambohimanga is further supported by a private association, Mamelomaso, which has also been active in campaigning for awareness and protection of cultural heritage and has contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> of numerous other sites of cultural and historic significance in the highlands. In addition to helping replant the Ambohimanga woodlands, Mamelomaso has contributed to the restoration of the stones around the source of the spring, erected informational plaques around the hill, and paved a number of footpaths within the site. UNESCO contributed special financial support to restore historic structures at Ambohimanga threatened by exceptionally heavy rainfall and landslides.|$|E
