25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} roles within the forces that women occupied during the war was that of interpreting aerial photographs taken by British spy planes over Allied Europe. There was equality in this work that was not found anywhere else during the war: women were considered equal to men in this field. Women {{played an important role in}} the planning of D-Day in this capacity-they analyzed <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> the Normandy Coast and decided which beaches the troops landed on and which sections. Women as photo analysts also participated in the biggest intelligence coup of the war-the discovery of the German V1 flying bomb. The participation of women allowed these bombs to be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The two {{children}} who modelled {{for the cover}} were siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates. The photo shoot was a frustrating affair {{over the course of}} ten days. Shooting was done {{first thing in the morning}} and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. <b>The</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> the {{two children}} were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results of the shoot were less than satisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created an unexpectedly striking album cover. The inner sleeve photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the Washington Tug and Barge Co. {{sold the}} Patterson to C.K. West Co. of Portland Oregon who {{converted}} {{her to a}} motorship for operation along the Oregon coast; the steam engine was replaced with a diesel, probably the four-cylinder Bolinder engine she had in 1930. It was probably at this time or a year later that she underwent a substantial rebuilding. Her deckhouse, bowsprit and eventually also her mizzenmast were removed, her bow was reshaped, and the fore and main masts were replaced with, or reduced to, pole masts. A stern deckhouse and superstructure were constructed. These changes are evident in <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> the 1938 shipwreck (this article and external links) and in a 1930 photo taken at Herschel Island.|$|E

500|$|Curtis P. Iaukea {{was celebrated}} as a Hawaiian {{who survived the}} monarchy and lived to tell about it.

He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, the Court of Appeal {{ruled that}} {{photographs}} collected by FITs {{of people who}} have not committed a criminal offence can no longer be kept. The ruling was made after Andrew Wood, an arms trade activist, was photographed after challenging the management of Reed Elsevier at their AGM over them organising arms trade exhibitions. Wood argued that police had harassed him and infringed his right to privacy by photographing him. Lord Collins of Mapesbury said that the police presence had a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on people who were protesting lawfully. FITs have not been banned but they must now justify the retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis.

The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going to take your picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E

500|$|When Homer and Marge [...] "snuggled" [...] to {{celebrate}} this development, she became pregnant. Homer {{was not happy}} {{when he found out}} about Marge's pregnancy, and was completely unenthusiastic about the impending birth. Because of the financial problems caused by the pregnancy, Homer was forced to make a sacrifice {{and go back to the}} power plant. However, Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back, and placed a large plaque in front of Homer's desk reading: [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer was once again unhappy at his work, but when Maggie was born, Homer instantly fell in love with her. Back in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not understand what that has to do with Maggie's photos. Homer merely mentions that they are in the place where he needs them the most. The scene then cuts to his workplace where all of <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> Maggie are positioned on the plaque on the wall, which now reads: [...] "Do it for her".|$|E
