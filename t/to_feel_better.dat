2500|$|The critic T. W. Baldwin {{explains}} that Sonnet 64 deals with Shakespeare's struggle against time, which he [...] "cannot withstand". He also presents {{the idea of}} the revolution of sea and land, although not many other critics agree. Sonnet 64 catalogues instances of inevitable destruction so as to provide a consolation for death and places [...] "emphasis on the inescapable fact of mutability". Because of the inevitability and finality of death, Shakespeare's lover is not choosing to leave him. On the contrary, his lover could not do anything about it. In this way, Shakespeare is able <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> about himself, because {{the love of his life}} was taken from him involuntarily. However, Sonnet 64 does not specify whether Shakespeare is more upset over the loss of life or the loss of love.|$|E

Arthur continues drinking even after he injures himself falling from a horse, which eventually leads to his death. Ralph, although he drinks heavily with his friends, {{does not seem to be}} as much afflicted by alcoholism as by his way of life. Mr Grimsby continues his degradation, going from bad to worse and eventually dying in a brawl. Huntingdon's son Arthur becomes addicted to alcohol through his father's efforts, but Helen begins to add to his wine a small quantity of tartar emetic, [...] "just enough to produce inevitable nausea and depression without positive sickness". Very soon the boy begins to be made to feel ill by the very smell of alcohol.|$|E

2500|$|Actor Matthew Gravelle {{took his}} role as the alleged murderer and {{possible}} paedophile Joe Miller very seriously. [...] "You don't want to get it wrong with whoever you're playing. You try to be as true to somebody who might actually be like that as possible," [...] Gravelle said. [...] "Whatever happens, he's still ultimately not a good person and you've got to try and be sympathetic towards him just to see it from his point of view." [...] He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendences. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. [...] "The need to be loved was the root of it," [...] he said. [...] "Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably an ego thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue." [...] Forced to stay apart {{from the rest of the}} cast to prevent the public or press from suspecting his involvement in series two, Gravelle used his sense of isolation to bring his character to life. Gravelle said he found that the key to his character in series two was desperation. Joe Miller, he said, sought spiritual relief in both series one and two out of a desperate bid <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> about himself and his crime. His not-guilty plea in series two, Gravelle felt, was also motivated by desperation (rather than a months-long plan to expose the town's secrets).|$|E
