5|$|After {{early work}} around Philadelphia and New York City, Richie Powell {{played in the}} bands of Paul Williams (1951–52) and Johnny Hodges (1952–54). He {{switched}} {{in the spring of}} 1954 to being pianist and arranger for the quintet co-led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and drummer Max Roach. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> toured extensively across the U.S. for two years, and released both studio and concert recordings, including the Grammy Hall of Fame inductee Clifford Brown & Max Roach.|$|E

Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front of strangers. While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a member of this working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George's Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, McLaughlin {{reformed}} the Mahavishnu Orchestra with Bill Evans on saxophones, Jonas Hellborg on bass, Mitchel Forman on keyboards, {{and original}} member Billy Cobham on drums. Cobham {{participated in the}} sessions for their self-titled 1984 album, but was replaced by Danny Gottlieb for live work, and Jim Beard replaced Mitchel Forman for the latter period of <b>this</b> <b>band's</b> life. <b>This</b> <b>band's</b> overall sound {{was different from the}} original Mahavishnu Orchestra, in particular because of McLaughlin's extensive use of the Synclavier synthesizer system.|$|R

5|$|Farmer {{worked in}} Los Angeles {{for a time}} as a hotel janitor and a {{hospital}} file clerk, before joining Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet chairs with Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of Teddy Charles' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in <b>this</b> <b>band</b> allowed him to consider {{a broader range of}} expression during improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Following graduation, Mercury {{joined a}} series of bands and sold {{second-hand}} clothes in the Kensington Market in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job at Heathrow Airport. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed {{a great deal of}} interest in music. In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage. He lived briefly in a flat above the Liverpool pub, The Dovedale Towers. When <b>this</b> <b>band</b> failed to take off, he joined a second band called Sour Milk Sea.

5|$|Gillan then {{formed a}} new band, simply called Gillan, {{retaining}} Towns (who would co-write {{most of the}} material), and adding guitarist Steve Byrd, bassist John McCoy and drummer Pete Barnacle. Byrd and Barnacle were quickly replaced by Bernie Tormé and by former Episode Six bandmate Mick Underwood, after Gillan saw Torme playing with his punk trio. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> had a more high powered hard rock sound, {{and the release of}} Mr. Universe in October 1979 saw Ian Gillan back in the UK charts, although the independent record company the album came out on – Acrobat Records – folded soon after the album was released, prompting a contract with Richard Branson's Virgin Records.|$|E

He was part of an octet led by trumpeter Eddie Robinson late in 1947, and played briefly with Snub Mosley around the same time. Hope had his first long-term association, with the Joe Morris band, from 1948 to 1951, including for several recordings. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> toured all over the United States.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw <b>this</b> <b>band</b> shrouded in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in <b>this</b> <b>band</b> oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E

5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military equipment {{as well as their}} gladiatorial weapons.

5|$|Timmons {{moved to}} New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his {{recording}} debut with the trumpeter {{in a live}} set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956–57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of <b>this</b> <b>band</b> for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957–58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{first met}} saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played {{together}} in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach {{later that year}} for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing, {{in part because it}} was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist's style. In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs, and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano's, was added to the group.|$|E

5|$|Twin Falls, Idaho native Paul Durham's singing {{career began}} when he was offered a spot singing in a local youth choir. After graduating from Oberlin College, Durham {{supported}} himself as a substitute teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area while fronting his acoustic band, Durham. Durham {{did not have any}} official releases, but some of their recorded material was released in 2004 as part of Paul Durham's solo album Ten Million Years. Paul Durham disbanded <b>this</b> <b>band</b> in 1995, signed to Geffen Records in 1996 after attracting attention from a number of labels, and hired bassist Geoff Stanfield, guitarist Michael Belfer and drummer Bryan Head to form Black Lab. The name is an amalgamation of two of the band's influences, Black Sabbath and Stereolab.|$|E
5|$|When Pinkus left in 1994, the {{remaining}} members enlisted {{a series of}} fill-in musicians, and continued to tour sporadically, even as all three pursued side projects. Haynes was working with Johnny Depp, Bill Carter, Sal Jenco, Flea, and others in a new group, P. In 1993, Haynes played with <b>this</b> <b>band</b> in Los Angeles' Viper Room, on the night the actor River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. Meanwhile, Leary was building {{a reputation as a}} skilled music producer, while Coffey set up his own record label Trance Syndicate. According to Leary and industry insiders, Haynes was increasingly dependent on hard drugs at this time, though Haynes has downplayed their concerns.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

5|$|Kelly {{was much}} in demand as a sideman for recordings, and {{appeared}} on albums {{by most of}} the major jazz leaders in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In April 1957, for instance, he appeared as a guest in an enlarged version of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, for an album later released as Theory of Art; <b>this</b> <b>band</b> included trumpeter Lee Morgan, with whom Kelly had recorded a few weeks earlier. The recording sessions continued four days later, with Kelly joining Blakey, Morgan and others on Griffin's A Blowin' Session; this was followed by three studio days for Gillespie, and another for trumpeter Clark Terry, {{before the end of the}} month. Later that year, Kelly made a rare appearance playing bass, for one track of vocalist Abbey Lincoln's That's Him!, after the regular bassist, Paul Chambers, became drunk and fell asleep in the studio.|$|E
5|$|On March25, 2014, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} accompanied by broad, flaring convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, vorticity became more enhanced and symmetrical. A compact system, the low steadily organized as it emerged over the Mozambique Channel on March26. Though continued land interaction initially hindered development, enhanced outflow supported convective development as it straddled the Mozambique–Tanzania border. With high sea surface {{temperatures in the}} storm's track, the JTWC anticipated further organization and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 2000UTC on March26. Once further offshore on March27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly east, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, <b>this</b> <b>band</b> disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air and suppressed convection over the circulation center.|$|E
5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999, by bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski. Before Rise Against, Principe and Wleklinski {{were members of the}} Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. <b>This</b> <b>band</b> toured and {{recorded}} to moderate success, but disbanded on two separate occasions in the late 1990s. Following the second breakup, Principe and Wleklinski decided to form a new band called Transistor Revolt, and recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath. Principe met McIlrath in Indianapolis while attending a Sick of It All concert, and recalled seeing him perform with his previous band Baxter. Impressed with McIlrath's gritty vocals, Principe gave him a seven track demo he had recorded, and invited him to join the nascent band. McIlrath accepted the invitation, and dropped out of Northeastern Illinois University.|$|E
