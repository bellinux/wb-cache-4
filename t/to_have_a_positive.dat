In 2004, the stadium ownership company {{changed its name to}} Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company's debt of NOK5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club's operating company <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> share capital and the club was thus allowed to keep its license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect on local businesses and tourism.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the impact of state legislation on mammography quality and access in Michigan. METHODS: The impact of state legislation was analyzed with respect to utilization, numbers of machines and facilities, and image quality. RESULTS: The legislation <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect on image quality improvement, had no impact on utilization by women aged 50 years and above, and resulted in few facility closures. CONCLUSIONS: Michigan's legislative intervention appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect on efforts to improve mammography quality assurance with implications for other federal and state efforts to achieve quality assurance in health care delivery...|$|R
5|$|Bonstelle {{sold her}} {{stake in the}} Garrick Theater in 1924. She and her company founded the Bonstelle Playhouse in Detroit, which opened on January 1, 1925. Backed by a {{syndicate}} led by a patron of hers, she bought a former synagogue on Woodward Avenue, Temple Beth El, for $500,000 and commissioned C. Howard Crane to renovate it. At first she carried on producing mostly Broadway-style plays. However, the company did perform classics, including modern-dress productions of Romeo and Juliet in 1926 and Hamlet in 1927, {{among the first to}} put on such performances. In February 1928 Bonstelle began a campaign to gain community support for the theater. A fund of over $200,000 was raised by donations from the public and Bonstelle made an agreement with local authorities to make the playhouse the city's unofficial premier theater. Later that year the group became known as the Detroit Civic Theater. In her plan for the theater she emphasized the importance of providing the public with the best drama, including both classics and modern works, and improving young people's knowledge of dramatic literature. Funded by public subscription, it had ticket prices as low as $1.50. Performances included works by Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The theater also played a religious role. Bonstelle used it in an effort to improve understanding and co-operation between the church and the theater, holding multi-denominational religious services there during Lent, and she stated that her plays, while avoiding being preachy, were intended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> moral influence on the audience. Local clergy publicly praised her work with the theater.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} between positivity of principal minors, sign symmetry {{and stability of}} matrices is studied.

The {{relation between}} spectra of matrices some of whose powers have positive principal minors and matrices whose corresponding powers have positive sums of principal minors of each order is studied as well.

25|$|In {{a game of}} cricket, the {{ultimate}} priority of the fielding side is to restrict {{the total number of}} runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving this is by dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side's run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batsmen from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batsmen and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without chondroitin sulfate (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per millilitre at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9 - 15 micromolar following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3 - 0.7 micromolar with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 fold lower than that required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> effect on the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158ng/mL compared to 89ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.|$|E

He {{averaged}} 112.79, which was until 2015 the highest average achieved by someone without actually winning the match. Taylor hit the ninth televised nine-darter of his career in the second week of the Premier League on the way to an 8–5 win against Kevin Painter. Two weeks later, he beat Simon Whitlock 8–4 and registered the highest three-dart average in the history of the tournament of 117.35. In week 13, Taylor beat James Wade 8–1 and averaged 116.10 in the process. Taylor ended the league campaign top of the table (eight points ahead of second placed Simon Whitlock) and was the only player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> leg difference. In the 14 game league phase, Taylor had registered five of the top fifteen televised three-dart averages in the history of the game. In the semi-finals, he faced James Wade against whom he had inflicted heavy 8–1 and 8–2 defeats during the league stage. The semi-final, however, was much more competitive. Taylor trailed early on before winning four consecutive legs to lead 6–4 before Wade responded to level at 6–6. Taylor then took out a 149 finish, with Wade on 57, to break before closing out the match 8–6 to reach the final against Simon Whitlock. Taylor looked to be heading for a comfortable win in the final as he raced into a 7–2 lead. However, the Australian stormed back to level at 7–7. Nevertheless, Taylor held his nerve to win the last three legs of the match to complete a 10–7 win and to seal his sixth Premier League title.|$|E
