25|$|Despite the commonalities which permit {{definition}} of the broad phenomenon of synesthesia, individual experiences vary in numerous ways. This variability was first noticed early in synesthesia research. Some synesthetes report that vowels are more strongly colored, while for others consonants are more strongly colored. Self reports, interviews, and autobiographical notes by synesthetes demonstrate a great degree of variety in types of synesthesia, intensity of synesthetic perceptions, awareness of <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> discrepancies between synesthetes and non-synesthetes, and the ways synesthesia is used in work, creative processes, and daily life.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{the study}} of {{perception}} as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (le corps propre) {{is not only a}} thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> openness to the world. He therefore underlines {{the fact that there is}} an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.|$|E
25|$|Piaget studied {{areas of}} {{intelligence}} like perception and memory {{that are not}} entirely logical.

To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures can’t be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline. Memory is the same way. It is never completely reversible. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the great}} variety of {{different}} speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved by means of <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) {{to arrive at the}} underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values. This process has been called vocal tract normalization (see Figure 3 for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they are listening to – this has been referred to as speech rate normalization.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the dorsal {{auditory}} pathway, {{projecting from}} the temporal lobe is largely concerned with processing spatial information, and contains receptive fields that are topographically organized. Fibers from this region project directly to neurons governing corresponding receptive fields in V1. <b>The</b> <b>perceptual</b> {{consequences of this}} {{have not yet been}} empirically acknowledged. However, it can be hypothesized that these projections may be the precursors of increased acuity and emphasis of visual stimuli in relevant areas of perceptual space. Consequently, this finding rejects Jones and Powell's (1970) hypothesis and thus is in conflict with Sadato et al.s (2004) findings. A resolution to this discrepancy includes the possibility that primary sensory areas can not be classified as a single group, and thus may be far more different from what was previously thought.|$|E
25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter.

25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific.

While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since {{no significant differences were}} found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> level.|$|E
25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, an {{exhibition}} called The Responsive Eye, curated by William C. Seitz, {{was held at}} the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City.

The exhibition focused on <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use optical illusions. Op art is also closely akin to geometric abstraction and hard-edge painting.

25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E
25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features {{are not just}} binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
25|$|Spivak also {{introduced}} the terms essentialism and strategic essentialism {{to describe the}} social functions of postcolonialism. The term essentialism denotes <b>the</b> <b>perceptual</b> dangers inherent to reviving subaltern voices in ways that might (over) simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups, and, thereby, create stereotyped representations of the different identities {{of the people who}} compose a given social group. The term strategic essentialism denotes a temporary, essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples. Furthermore, essentialism can occasionally be applied—by the so-described people—to facilitate the subaltern's communication in being heeded, heard, and understood, because a strategic essentialism (a fixed and established subaltern identity) is more readily grasped, and accepted, by the popular majority, in the course of inter-group discourse. The important distinction, between the terms, is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities (cultural and ethnic) in a social group, but that, in its practical function, strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identity.|$|E
