500|$|Khrushchev {{considered}} U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner, and {{was delighted}} by his {{defeat in the}} 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, Massachusetts Senator John F.

Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first manned spaceflight and Kennedy a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy on the other hand had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of East–West tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to his brother Robert as [...] "like dealing with Dad. All give and no take." ...|$|E
