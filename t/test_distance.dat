40|$|Most {{people realize}} that they use their vision to enhance speech {{perception}} in circumstances where the auditory stimulus is degraded in some way.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the change in speech perception scores across modality when the distance between the talker and listener was increased. Normally hearing college students participated in this study. Testing was performed in three conditions (auditory-only, visual-only, and auditory-visual) for the five distances of three, six, eleven, sixteen, and twenty-one feet. Mean speech perception scores were best for the auditory-visual condition over all <b>test</b> <b>distances.</b> Auditory-only mean scores were second best at three feet only, then decreased to be the worst of the three conditions for the remaining <b>test</b> <b>distances.</b> Visual-only mean scores were second highest for the four farthest <b>test</b> <b>distances.</b> The mean scores for the auditory-visual condition were better than the summed scores of auditory-only and visual-only for the four farthest distances and similar for the closest distance of three feet. The mean auditory-visual score at twenty-one feet was equal to auditory-only performance at three feet and better than visual-only performance at the closest distance of three feet. The results suggest that while at close communication distances, auditory-visual speech perception behaves in the same manner as auditory-only speech perception, at increased distances between the talker and listener the input from the visual system increasingly influences the behavior of auditory-visual speech perception. ...|$|R

The accelerometer measured physical activity using total activity counts per day and energy expenditure (kcal/d). Results—Excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the activity counts (paretic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95, nonparetic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 94) and for the energy expenditure (paretic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95, nonparetic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95) were found across the 3 consecutive days at home.

40|$|Introduction. Developing {{the ability}} to control the speed of {{swimming}} {{is an important part of}} swimming training. Maintaining a defined constant speed makes it possible for the athlete to swim economically at a low physiological cost. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of concurrent visual feedback transmitted by the Leader device on the control of swimming speed in a single exercise test. Material and methods. The study involved a group of expert swimmers (n = 20). Prior to the experiment, the race time for the 100 m distance was determined for each of the participants. In the experiment, the participants swam the distance of 100 m without feedback and with visual feedback. In both variants, the task of the participants was to swim the <b>test</b> <b>distance</b> in a time as close as possible to the time designated prior to the experiment. In the first version of the experiment (without feedback), the participants swam the <b>test</b> <b>distance</b> without receiving real-time feedback on their swimming speed. In the second version (with visual feedback), the participants followed a beam of light moving across the bottom of the swimming pool, generated by the Leader device. Results. During swimming with visual feedback, the 100 m race time was significantly closer to the time designated. The difference between the pre-determined time and the time obtained was significantly statistically lower during swimming with visual feedback (p = 0. 00002). Conclusions. Concurrently transmitting visual feedback to athletes improves their control of swimming speed. The Leader device has proven useful in controlling swimming speed...|$|E

Both FTCR and TCR treatment groups undertook supervised low to moderate intensity exercise training for 6 weeks and were provided with home exercise advice. Fast-track CR included once-weekly exercise sessions and a 1 -time 7 -hour education session; TCR included twice-weekly exercise and education sessions.

A direct correlation was found between asymmetric ratio of emphysema and change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = 0. 65, P <. 00001). At 60 months, residual volume (− 6. 2 %), maximal incremental treadmill test score (+ 100 %), and Short Form- 36 Quality of Life questionnaire physical functioning domain score (+ 70 %) were still significantly improved. Five-year survival was 82 %; 5 -year freedom from contralateral lung volume reduction was 70 %. ConclusionsIn this series, significant, long-lasting improvements and satisfactory survival were seen after intentional unilateral lung volume reduction. Heterogeneity of emphysema between lungs was directly correlated with improvement at 36 months in forced expiratory volume in 1 second.

In {{the present study}} intermediate-range gunshot wounds have been analysed {{by means of a}} micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) coupled to an image analysis software in order to quantify the powder particles and to determine the firing distance. A total of 50 shootings were performed on skin sections obtained from human legs surgically amputated for medical reasons. For each <b>tested</b> <b>distance</b> (5, 15, 23, 30 and 40 cm), firing was carried out perpendicularly at the samples using a 7. 65 -mm pistol loaded with jacketed bullets.

By increasing the firing distance, micro-CT analysis demonstrated a clear decreasing trend in the mean GSR percentage, particularly for shots fired from more than 15 cm. For distances under 23 cm, the powder particles were concentrated on the epidermis and dermis around the hole, and inside the cavity; while, at greater distances, they were deposited only on the skin surface. Statistical analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between the amount of GSR deposits and the firing range, well explained by a Gaussian-like function.

The Single Leg Hop for <b>Distance</b> <b>test</b> is used to assess functional performance in individuals with an ACL injury or reconstruction.

Sixty-one males and sixty-one females between 15 and 16 years who participated in a club soccer program participated in the study. The Hop test and the step-down test were administered to the subjects. Mean hop distance for males was 172. 89 cm (SD = 18. 27) and the mean hop distance for females was 146. 88 cm (SD = 14. 63). For both males and females, there were no differences in hop distances between the left and right lower extremity (LE). There were no differences in hop distances according to classification of the step-down test for males. Females classified as good by the step-down test hopped farther than females classified as poor. There were no relationships between distances in the hop test and height in females (r =. 23 for the left LE;. 21 for the right LE). There was a low relationship between distances in the hop test and height in males (r =. 46 for the left LE;. 39 for the right LE). Clinicians may utilize this information for goal setting and objective testing during rehabilitation...|$|R
