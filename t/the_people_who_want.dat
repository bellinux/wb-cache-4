500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The {{title of the}} album is a play on words, Cazares comments [...] "You {{have the right to}} keep your mouth shut, but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot". Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are about personal strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a [...] "big fuck you" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> his projects to fail.|$|E
500|$|In June 2012 the Dumas was {{conveyed}} to new owners, locals Michael Piche and Travis Eskelson. By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around. It needs {{to be here for}} the rest of the community and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to visit it," [...] said Piche. In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte. The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant. As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.|$|E
50|$|The year 1900 {{was one of}} {{the darkest}} for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to abolish capital {{punishment}} in Sweden with three executions in the same year, all by decapitation (between 1866 and 1900 there were 11 executions in total). <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> argued that one inherited the role as a criminal and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep <b>the</b> death penalty used Nordlund as an example of why this penalty was necessary. Abolitionists such as Hjalmar Branting only argued that it was unfortunate that Nordlund had been released from prison.|$|R

500|$|The biggest {{studio in}} the low-budget field {{remained}} a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing Sisters, Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> their gratuitous gore.... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make}} a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974).|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> {{to go with me}} on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson and Rose {{were both}} banned from MLB for life for actions related to {{gambling}} {{on their own}} teams—Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on {{a game in which}} a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to [...] "those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer".|$|E
5000|$|While {{talking to}} local media about, Urwa Hocane portraying {{the role of}} Meera {{discussed}} {{the importance of the}} drama and social taboos like child abuse and rape. Hocane said, It’s about time for women to talk about this. I think Udaari has brought a change. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to ban it couldn’t because of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> drama to bring about a change. Girls don’t speak about such things. I am probably destined to change that mindset. [...] Furthermore, talking about her role of Meera being a local musician, Hocane stated, I want to change <b>the</b> mindset of <b>people.</b> Bushra jee told me that the word miraasi comes from miraas. You should be proud of it rather than feel horrible about it.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{important}} to relate {{that he did not}} do this for money – he received no payment for these services as he considered it his [...] "hobby" [...] – he did this work for the love of travel, for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to experience <b>the</b> mountains he held in such high regard.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director Brian De Palma, whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing Sisters, De Palma's first horror film, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous dumbness too?... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make}} a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.|$|E
2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E

50|$|The railroads {{took the}} Cathedral Car {{to the various}} hamlets. The bishop would have {{placards}} announcing its coming {{and the time of}} worship posted before he arrived.

It, and the Sermon on the Mount, and Machiavelli's Prince, and La Rochefoucauld's maxims, and Hymns Ancient and Modern, and De Glanville's apologue, and Dr. Watts's rhymes, and Nietzsche's Gay Science, and Ingersoll's Mistakes of Moses, and the speeches and pamphlets of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> us to make war on Germany, and the Noodle's Orations and articles of our politicians and journalists, must all be tolerated not only because any of them may for all we know be on the right track but because it is in the conflict of opinion that we win knowledge and wisdom.
