5|$|The electoral {{district}} {{ceased to exist}} at <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> the writ for the 1888 Northwest Territories general election.

During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three-year terms.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> {{consumer}} confidence in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} Flanders seemed to be heading for a {{successful}} acting career. He contracted polio in 1943 while serving in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve {{and for the rest}} of his life was reliant on a wheelchair. He made a career as a prolific broadcaster on radio and later television, and together with his old schoolfriend, the composer Donald Swann, he wrote successful songs in the late 1940s and early and mid-1950s for revues in the West End of London. In 1956 they themselves performed some of these songs, along with new songs, in a two-man revue, At <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> a Hat. This show, and its successor, At <b>the</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>of</b> Another Hat, ran with occasional short breaks from 1956 to 1967 and played in theatres throughout the British Isles, the US, Australia and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Leptin, however, plays a {{different}} role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and- when leptin levels drop due to weight loss- hunger increases. <b>The</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> leptin is better {{viewed as a}} starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a satiety signal. However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as leptin resistance. The changes {{that occur in the}} hypothalamus to result in leptin resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September, three Lockheed C-130 Hercules {{aircraft}} set {{off from}} Jakarta for Peninsula Malaysia, flying low to avoid detection by radar. The following night, {{two of the}} C-130 managed to reach their objective with their onboard PGT paratroopers, who jumped off and landed around Labis in Johore (about 100 miles north of Singapore). The remaining C-130 crashed into the Malacca Straits while trying to evade interception by an RAF Javelin FAW 9 launched from RAF Tengah. Due to a lightning storm, <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> 96 paratroopers was widely dispersed. This resulted in them landing close to 1/10 Gurkhas, who were joined by 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) stationed near Malacca with 28 (Commonwealth) Brigade. Operations were commanded by 4 Malaysian Brigade, {{but it took a}} month for the security force to capture or kill 90 of the 96 parachutists, for the loss of two men killed during the action.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} a uniform {{magnetic}} field on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> specific size has been investigated numerically in a T-shaped microchannel. Previous researches indicated that <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> sizes <b>of</b> secondary stream decreases, with increasing main stream flow rate and decreasing interfacial tension. In the present study the {{effect of a}} uniform magnetic field on the main stream is considered, and it is proposed that by increasing the Hartmann number, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary stream will be decreased.
