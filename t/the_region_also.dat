5|$|The {{region is}} best known for its Pinot noir, and also {{produces}} large amounts of Pinot gris, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, and Riesling. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> produces Cabernet Sauvignon, Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Sémillon, and Zinfandel grapes, but in far smaller quantities.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} reduce media {{centralisation}} in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their program production to MediaCityUK in Salford. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these {{are important to the}} local TV industry – the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, Our Friends in the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax.|$|E

5|$|During the season, {{advisories}} {{were issued}} by Météo-France's (MFR) meteorological office at Réunion. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility {{was from the}} coast of Africa to 80°E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>also</b> tracked a long-lived tropical storm in November {{in addition to the}} 8 storms MFR named, which is comparable to the average of nine named storms per year.

Along with the Hoover Dam and Nellis Air Force Base, the region has additional landmarks, including its own vaults and the HELIOS One solar energy plant.|$|E
5|$|Météo-France's {{meteorological}} office in Réunion (MFR) {{is the official}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the South-West Indian Ocean, tracking all tropical cyclones from {{the east coast of}} Africa to 90° E. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>also</b> issued advisories for storms during the season. Following the season, the start of the tropical cyclone year was changed to July1, which defines the boundary between tropical cyclone seasons.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, the Foch Line was {{accepted}} by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between the two states. Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3. Neither country was satisfied: both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwałki and Vilnius regions, respectively. Those Germans still present in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> objected to the boundary of the line. The Lithuanian forces (about 350 strong) left the town of Suwałki by August 7, but stopped in Sejny and formed a line at the Czarna Hańcza river – Wigry Lake. Lithuanians believed that the Foch Line was not the final decision, {{and that they had}} the duty to protect Lithuanian outposts in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), {{which is}} a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues {{tropical}} cyclone warnings for <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>also</b> issued advisories for storms in the year. The agency tracked a tropical depression in July 1982. The system formed on July4 southeast of Seychelles, and initially curved to the southwest. It failed to intensify beyond winds of 55km/h (35mph), and dissipated on July4 after turning to the northwest. At the time, the annual tropical cyclone year was from August1 to July31 of the subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.|$|E

5|$|There {{were six}} storms {{named by the}} weather service in Madagascar or Mauritius, with {{advisories}} issued by Météo-France's meteorological office at Réunion (MFR). At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80°E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> <b>also</b> tracked a short-lived tropical storm in February, which formed on February5 northeast of Mauritius.

5|$|While Nicole was intensifying offshore, {{its outer}} bands {{produced}} heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of 9.22inches (235mm) fell at Cape Cruz, in the mountainous Granma Province. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to 53mph (85km/h) at Guantánamo Bay. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300people sought {{refuge from the}} storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eighthouses collapsed and more than 300others were inundated in the coastal town of Pilón. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000lbs (2.5tons) of lost crops and livestock. These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the alleviation of a persistent dry spell provided by the rains.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|In 629, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had {{recently}} succeeded in unifying all the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. Those tribes {{had previously been}} too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians. Now unified and animated by their new conversion to Islam, they comprised {{one of the most}} powerful states in the region. The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the Battle of Mu'tah in September 629. A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of Arabia in response to their ambassador's murder at the hands of the Ghassanid Roman governor, but were repulsed. Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory, there was no apparent reason to make changes to the military configuration of <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> <b>Also,</b> the Byzantines had little preceding battlefield experience with the Arabs, and even less with zealous soldiers united by a prophet. Even the Strategicon of Maurice, a manual of war praised for the variety of enemies it covers, does not mention warfare against Arabs at any length.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after Chanchu moved through the Philippines, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered that the country's National Disaster Coordinating Council help all towns {{affected}} by the storm. The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions. Several areas were {{declared a state of}} calamity, mostly on Mindoro, Samar, and Batangas. The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar, providing money to the families whose houses were destroyed. Towns in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes. In Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200families in Mindoro. Ultimately, the government provided storm victims with ₱415.1million (PHP, $7.6million USD) worth of relief supplies. Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake, after dispersing a Ceratium bloom.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} the sheep {{industry}} in Australia was explosive. In 1820, the continent held 100,000 sheep, a decade later it had one million. By 1840, New South Wales alone kept 4 million sheep; flock numbers grew to 13 million in a decade. While much of the growth in both nations {{was due to the}} active support of Britain in its desire for wool, both worked independently to develop new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, Coolalee, Coopworth, Perendale, Polwarth, Booroola Merino, Peppin Merino, and Poll Merino were all created in New Zealand or Australia. Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and maritime shipping, wool {{was one of the few}} viable products that was not subject to spoiling on the long passage back to British ports. The abundant new land and milder winter weather of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> aided the {{growth of the}} Australian and New Zealand sheep industries.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of the anti-meridian, are officially monitored by either the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored, non-frontal synoptic disturbance, that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance, that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Once either of these classifications are met, then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression, if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn (38mph; 62km/h). However, if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone. Should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63kn (39–73mph; 63–118km/h), then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.|$|E
5|$|Lightning, {{a central}} {{character}} from both XIII and XIII-2, is the game's main protagonist, sole playable character, and narrator.

Noel Kreiss, feeling guilty over his role in the deaths of Etro and Serah and the world's current state, becomes a vigilante in Luxerion. Sazh Katzroy and his son Dajh, who fell into a comatose state, reside in the Wildlands. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>also</b> becomes the home of Mog, Noel and Serah's former moogle companion from XIII-2; Caius Ballad, Lightning's old adversary and the one responsible for the unleashing of Chaos into the mortal world; and Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a former seeress and pivotal character in the previous game whose cycle of early death and reincarnation was the motivation behind Caius's actions.
