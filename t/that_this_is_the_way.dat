500|$|As it was {{intended}} to be Nimoy's last portrayal of Spock, the actor was adamant that his appearance be faithful to the original 1960s Fred Phillips and Charlie Schram design of the character. Mills consulted photos from the original television series as reference, and created five ear sculptings before Nimoy was satisfied. The result was tall ears with the tips pointing forward—considerably different from Richard Snell's swept-back look for The Voyage Home. The character of Valeris was designed to be more ivory-hued than Spock's yellow tone, with sleeker eyebrows and a severe haircut favored by Meyer. [...] "We went to great pains to establish <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a Vulcan woman—a sexy Vulcan woman—would look," [...] said Mills.|$|E

500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he remembered the occasion, because it was how {{he would have liked to}} behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been aimed at Carmel's portrayal {{as a health}} visitor. In the late 1980s, a specialist nursing magazine called Nursing Times [...] had a feature on the character, remarking that she [...] "has come in for {{quite a bit of}} stick from HVA [...] members who haven't felt that the character gives a good impression of their role". HVA members expressed disappointment that the character [...] "has not developed in a way which promotes the role of health visitors more positively." [...] Roma Iskander, who had discussed the role with EastEnders scriptwriters on behalf of the HVA, said that [...] "Carmel isn't a positive image of a black woman or a health visitor." [...] The magazine article suggested that Carmel's personal problems with family and clients served her right [...] "for moving to Albert Square in the first place. Health visitors be warned — don't live on your work patch". However, in Dominic Strinati's book, Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain, Christine Geraghty has argued that [...] "the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depended on her being part {{of the life of the}} Square, regularly and unproblematically available as a source of advice and support in her professional capacity as well as the focus of interest in terms of her personal life." [...] Geraghty has said that tension arose from conflict in the 1980s soaps [...] "between a desire to be positive about a particular issue and a commitment to credibility in terms of character and setting. The HVA, it would appear, want Carmel to be a model health visitor, demonstrating a wide range of skills in a professional manner. But the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depends on her being a character who is part of the life of the Square, a professional who makes mistakes and whose personal life is almost a source of interest. Quite clearly, the demands for a positive image for health visitors as a profession are less pressing than the necessity to be able to deploy Carmel as a soap opera character. Those making the programme are quite certain <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it must be." ...|$|E

6000|$|This indeed {{seemed to}} be the case, for {{on the top of a}} steep rock close to the edge of the sea we {{observed}} an old penguin endeavouring to entice her young one into the water; but the young one seemed very unwilling to go, and notwithstanding the enticements of its mother, moved very slowly towards her. At last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed it a little towards the water, but with great tenderness, as much as to say, [...] "Don't be afraid, darling; I won't hurt you, my pet!" [...] But no sooner did she get it to the edge of the rock, where it stood looking pensively down at the sea, than she gave it a sudden and violent push, sending it headlong down the slope into the water, where its mother left it to scramble ashore as it best could.

Consider, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to {{convince}} all men, {{that the power}} of God's things hath taken hold of thy heart I speak to them that hold the head 20and say what thou wilt, if thy faith be not accompanied with a holy life, thou shalt be judged a withered branch, a wording professor, salt without savour, and as lifeless as a sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal (John 15; Matt 13:1 Cor 13:1, 2). For, say they, show us your faith by your works, for we cannot see your hearts (James 2:18). But I say on the contrary, if thou walk as becomes thee who art saved by grace, then thou wilt witness in every man's conscience, that thou art a good tree; now thou leavest guilt on the heart of the wicked (1 Sam 24:16, 17). Now thou takest off occasion from them that desire occasion; and now thou art clear from the blood of all men (2 Cor 11:12; Acts 20:26, 31-35). This is the man also that provoketh others to good works. The ear that heareth such a man shall bless him; and the eye that seeth him shall bear witness to him.

Those in whom that fancy lingers must have but a paltry standard of what righteousness is, a mean conception of moral--that is, spiritual--perfection. But those who look not inwards, but upwards; not at themselves, but at Christ and all spiritual perfection--they become more and more painfully aware of their own imperfections. The beauty of Christ's character shows them the ugliness of their own. His purity shows them their own foulness. His love their own hardness. His wisdom their own folly. His strength their own weakness. The higher their standard rises, the lower falls their estimate of themselves; till, in utter humiliation and self-distrust, they seek comfort ere alone it can be found--in FAITH--in utter faith and trust in that very moral perfection of Christ which shames and dazzles them, and yet is their only hope. To trust in Him for themselves and all they love. To trust that, just because Christ is so magnificent, He will pity, and not despise, our meanness. Just because He is so pure, and righteous, and true, and lovely, He will appreciate, and not abhor, our struggles after purity, righteousness, truth, love, however imperfect, however soiled with failure--and with worse. Just because He is so unlike us, He will smile graciously upon out feeblest attempts to be like Him. Just because He has borne the sins and carried the sorrows of mankind, therefore those who come to Him He will in no wise cast out. [...] Amen.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> whereby men first formed general ideas, {{and general}} names to them, I think is so evident, that there needs no other proof {{of it but}} the {{considering}} of a man's self, or others, and the ordinary proceedings of their minds in knowledge. And he that thinks GENERAL NATURES or NOTIONS are anything else but such abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones, taken at first from particular existences, will, I fear, be at a loss where to find them. For let any one effect, and then tell me, wherein does his idea of MAN differ from that of PETER and PAUL, or his idea of HORSE from that of BUCEPHALUS, but in the leaving out something that is peculiar to each individual, and retaining so much of those particular complex ideas of several particular existences as they are found to agree in? Of the complex ideas signified by the names MAN and HORSE, leaving out but those particulars wherein they differ, and retaining only those wherein they agree, and of those making a new distinct complex idea, and giving the name ANIMAL to it, one has a more general term, that comprehends with man several other creatures. Leave out {{of the idea of}} ANIMAL, sense and spontaneous motion, and the remaining complex idea, made up of the remaining simple ones of body, life, and nourishment, becomes a more general one, under the more comprehensive term, VIVENS. And, not to dwell longer upon this particular, so evident in itself; by the same way the mind proceeds to BODY, SUBSTANCE, and at last to BEING, THING, and such universal terms, which stand for any of our ideas whatsoever. To conclude: this whole mystery of genera and species, which make such a noise in the schools, and are with justice so little regarded out of them, is nothing else but ABSTRACT IDEAS, more or less comprehensive, with names annexed to them. In all which this is constant and unvariable, That every more general term stands for such an idea, and is but a part of any of those contained under it.|$|E
