5|$|The current Cultural Centre, {{in front}} of Ross Park, is a three-floor casino {{constructed}} with imported materials in the early 1900s by Agustín Ross. It originally housed a mail and <b>telegraph</b> <b>service,</b> with a large store. The first casino in Chile was opened in this building on 20 January 1906. It operated until 1932, when the Viña del Mar Casino was opened.|$|E
5|$|Baalham {{arrived on}} October 3, {{following}} a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief {{letter to the}} American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's Newfoundlander, while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a <b>telegraph</b> <b>service,</b> these reports {{had to be taken}} by the steamer Merlin to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they could be wired to New York. Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to Sydney, Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11.|$|E
5|$|During the British period, Sandakan grew {{quickly as}} one of the largest British {{settlements}} on the east coast of North Borneo including having been the former capital of the territory. It grew rapidly due to the export activities as a port town. The port is important for palm oil, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, manila hemp and sago exports. In the mid-1930s, the export of tropical timber from Sandakan recorded a level of 180,000 cubic metres which made the town as the world's largest exporter of hardwood. Many Sandakan wood logs are now found in Beijing's Temple of Heaven. Sandakan also enjoyed modern developments such as <b>telegraph</b> <b>service</b> to London and paved streets before Hong Kong and Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Madras {{was linked}} {{to the rest of the}} world through {{telegraphs}} in 1853 and a civilian <b>telegraph</b> <b>service</b> was introduced on 1 February 1855. Soon afterwards, telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India. A Telegraph department was set up in 1854, with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city. The Colombo-Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon. Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras. A wireless telgraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.|$|E
5|$|Snedden also {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} upgrades to the News-Miner's printing equipment. In 1953, rotary printing was introduced to Fairbanks after Snedden purchased a used rotary press from The Sacramento Union. To house the press, Snedden built a two-story building adjacent to the Lathrop Building. The Lathrop Building still contained most of the News-Miner's offices and typesetting equipment, but it was not large enough to contain the new press without extensive renovations, thus requiring a new building. Shortly after the new press was introduced, the News-Miner produced its first full-color newspaper. The new equipment also allowed for larger print jobs, and Snedden introduced an annual Progress Edition that was intended to be distributed outside Alaska in order to attract business and industry to the state. In 1954, the News-Miner obtained a dedicated teletype to the Associated Press, avoiding the need for contracts for telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>service</b> to a correspondent in Seattle who would relay AP material to the News-Miner.|$|E

25|$|The slew of {{problems}} {{experienced by the}} trams shocked Struve, who in 1890, had written {{a letter to the}} City Administration of Kiev suggesting that for increased safety and easier use, the trams would need to be powered using electric motors.

25|$|On 18 March 1840, liberal caudillo Morazán invaded Guatemala with 1500 {{soldiers}} to avenge the insult done in Los Altos. Fearing that such action would end with liberal efforts {{to hold together}} the Central American Federation, Guatemala had a cordon of guards from the border with El Salvador; without a <b>telegraph</b> <b>service,</b> men ran carrying last-minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched a plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero in charge of troops who presented only slight resistance in the city. Carrera pretended to flee and led his ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno, with few men, few rifles and two old cannons. The city was {{at the mercy of}} the army of Morazán, with bells of the twenty churches ringing for divine assistance.|$|E

25|$|The Mackay Radio & Telegraph Company {{was founded}} in 1884 by John William Mackay (a wealthy silver mine owner) and James Gordon Bennett as the Commercial Cable Company {{with the goal of}} {{providing}} transatlantic <b>telegraph</b> <b>service.</b> Mackay next incorporated the Postal Telegraph Company to expand the system across the continental United States. In 1901, Mackay formed the Commercial Pacific Cable Company to provide cable telegraphic service across the Pacific Ocean. Although Mackay died in 1902, his son, Clarence Mackay, continued to head the company. In 1925, Clarence Mackay founded Mackay Radio, and added a radio network to the telegraph business. In 1928, the Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. merged with its two cable siblings and All America Cables to form the American Cable & Radio Corporation. The majority shareholder in the new company was the International Telephone & Telegraph Co.|$|E
25|$|The {{first light}} keeper at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One room of his cottage functioned as a postal receiving office, complete with telegraph facilities, with the light keeper appointed as the receiving office keeper. In 1910 the <b>telegraph</b> <b>service</b> was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a rough track along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This rough track eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted at the light keeper's cottage.|$|E
25|$|In 1865–67 {{a beacon}} was {{installed}} on the southeast terrace {{of the building and}} a <b>telegraph</b> <b>service</b> was started, while nearby a gas factory was built, producing smoke that prompted many protests. The first moves to preserve and rehabilitate the tower began {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century. First, the tower was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 1940, which undertook small conservation works. Then the military quarters on the battlements were removed and the inner cloister was built. The architectural landscape designer António Viana Barreto began a three-year project in 1953 to integrate the tower with the local shoreline. In 1983 the site hosted the 17th European Exhibition on Art, Science and Culture, and various projects involving the building were undertaken, among them covering the cloister with a transparent plastic cupola. In the same year the Belém Tower was classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
