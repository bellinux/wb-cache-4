40|$|The {{political}} {{activities of the}} 450 or so French-speaking anarchists exiled in Great Britain between 1880 and 1914 have recently {{been the subject of}} diverging historiographical assessments. The <b>terrorist</b> <b>motive,</b> which the movement's contemporaries were so concerned with, has been taken up by several studies. Yet a transnational approach brings out a very different interpretation: that of a group with a predominantly informal organisation (against the myth of the "anarchist International"), overwhelmed with basic material preoccupations, and more inclined to strategic thinking concerning the revolutionary potential of trade unions than to terrorist pursuits. In the light of this analysis, it is therefore more fruitful to describe London's "French quarter", not as a terrorist outpost, but rather as a node of networks and transfers for the international anarchist movement...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, {{the murder}} of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, UK led to an {{extensive}} public social media reaction. Given the extreme <b>terrorist</b> <b>motive</b> and public nature of the actions it was feasible that the public response could include written expressions of hateful and antagonistic sentiment towards a particular race, ethnicity and religion, which {{can be interpreted as}} ‘hate speech’. This provided motivation to study the spread of hate speech on Twitter following such a widespread and emotive event. In this paper we present a supervised machine learning text classifier, trained and tested to distinguish between hateful and/or antagonistic responses with a focus on race, ethnicity or religion; and more general responses. We used human annotated data collected from Twitter {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Lee Rigby’s murder to train and test the classifier. As “Big Data” is a growing topic of study, and its use is in policy and decision making is being constantly debated at present, we discuss the use of supervised machine learning tools to classify a sample of “Big Data”, and how the results can be interpreted for use in policy and decision making. The results of the classifier are optimal using a combination of probabilistic, rule-based and spatial based classifiers with a voted ensemble meta-classifier. We achieve an overall F-measure of 0. 95 using features derived from the content of each tweet, including syntactic dependencies between terms to recognise “othering” terms, incitement to respond with antagonistic action, and claims of well founded or justified discrimination against social groups. We then demonstrate how the results of the classifier can be robustly utilized in a statistical model used to forecast the likely spread of hate speech in a sample of Twitter data...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} the September 11, 2001, attack by Al Qaeda was felt {{worldwide}} with increased security measures. However, maritime security measures are not as encompassing. This thesis investigated the possibility of maritime domain terrorism threats {{and what could be}} done to prevent such attacks as modeled on the basis of system of systems. Only certain terrorist groups have the capability to launch maritime terrorist attacks. The <b>terrorist</b> <b>motives</b> are to spread their political message, responding to what they have perceived as oppression. The system of systems model suggests (and is validated) that container vessels and cruise ships are potential targets, with possible human and economic consequences. However, these maritime targets failed to match the terrorist groups objectives. Political assets such as warships and land-based maritime infrastructure align well to <b>terrorist</b> <b>motives.</b> Enhanced security measures protecting military and maritime infrastructure may require terrorists to use uncommon forms of attack. Terrorists could use submersible vehicles to remain undetectable. Costly submersible vehicles limit the type and number of terrorist groups that can employ such capability.

40|$|Terrorism is a {{relatively}} new phenomenon, and data on terrorist motivations and psychological profiles of terrorists are fairly scarce and limited. In theory, there is a large number of quantitative analyses of collective violence, murder, and crime, however, none of these can be identified with terrorism. Most current studies do not consider a great heterogeneity of terrorists, and numerous practical, conceptual, and psychological barriers slow down the science of learning about terrorism. Psychology, as a science of behavior, certainly makes a great contribution to the study of terrorism as a very complex phenomenon. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze and synthesize social and psychological determinants which contribute to the development of <b>terrorist</b> <b>motives,</b> and to elaborate on those facts which have been discussed in scientific and professional literature so far...|$|R

50|$|A {{terrorist}} attack was also conducted in Croatia. On 20 October 1995, a terrorist from the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya Islamic group attempted {{to destroy a}} police station in Rijeka by driving {{a car with a}} bomb into the wall of the building. The attack resulted in 29 injured people and the death of the <b>terrorist.</b> The <b>motive</b> for the attack was the capture of Talaat Fouad Qasim by the HVO, an important member of the Islamic group. There have been no cases since.|$|R
5000|$|Ogden {{notes that}} many Tibetans desire greater {{cultural}} and political autonomy, if not full independence, and outbreaks of violent clashes with authorities in the region occur only intermittently, {{such as in the}} 2008 Lhasa violence. Ogden credits the low incidence of conventional terrorism in Tibet to an undereducated population, swift and harsh responses to terrorism by the Chinese state, and the pacific influence of Buddhism. Nonetheless, there are segments of the Tibetan and Tibetan diasporic population who reject the leadership of the Dalai Lama and view violent opposition as the only viable route towards independence. Notable instances of violence against civilians include a series of attacks 1996 in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, and a bombing in a public square in the city of Chengdu in April 2002, which Chinese authorities allege were carried out by Tibetan separatists. Chinese authorities adopt a broad definition of terrorism with respect to Tibet, and have labelled a variety of protests and expressions of opposition as terrorism. In 2012, for instance, authorities referred to the Dalai Lama's prayer sessions for Tibetan self-immolators as [...] "terrorism in disguise." [...] Authorities have also ascribed <b>terrorist</b> <b>motives</b> to Tibetan exiles who call for independence, and to Tibetan monks who travel to India without government authorization.|$|R

In this change the religious values they proclaim end being violated while the people they want to liberate become their victims. In to survive these groups end up collaborating with the very followers of faiths they regard disbelief. This somehow creates a problem of understanding <b>terrorists,</b> their <b>motives</b> and that of their supporters. In addition, this paper shows that reasons for the rise of these movements were not religious and the solution equally is not religious but political...|$|R
40|$|Since September 11, 2001, the United States {{recognizes the}} global risk of terrorism. Although {{the risk of}} a {{terrorist}} attack at any one hotel is very low, the severity of the consequences is great, making it important for hoteliers to understand <b>terrorist</b> <b>motives</b> and to protect hotel guests and assets to the fullest extent possible. Terrorists desire to cause fear and social disruption and to use violence to make their message known to a global audience. Most terrorist attacks currently involve explosives, but biological weapons have the potential to harm much larger populations, especially if released into the air, building ventilation systems, or water supplies. Hotels that serve international customers, hold an iconic brand, or are owned by persons considered to be part of an “enemy” group are most at risk. No bioterrorism mitigation guidelines specific to hotels have yet been developed with input from hotel security managers. Guidelines are needed to establish best practices and security benchmarks, and to develop training programs for managers and employees. This study uses a Delphi method to poll hotel security managers about critical and feasible measures that hotels should take to prevent acts of bioterrorism. This information can be used to prioritize strategies for bioterrorism prevention and response, and can be utilized as the basis for establishing industry best practices and benchmarks. It {{is one of the first}} studies to investigate guidelines for bioterrorism in the hotel industry. As such this study can be used as a foundation for future research...|$|R

50|$|The {{reporter}} {{is asked to}} televise a statement by the terrorists calling for delivery to them of every nuclear trigger device at the U.S. Naval Base in Charleston. Without these triggers, nuclear weapons on the naval warships and nuclear-powered submarines based at Charleston cannot be used. The <b>terrorists</b> reveal their <b>motive</b> is to completely disarm America of nuclear weapons, {{as well as to}} convince the Soviet Union to do the same, which they believe will completely prevent possible nuclear war. They also mention they have constructed their own nuclear device; one roughly equivalent to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. Their device is set to detonate within 24 hours if their demand is not met, and has anti-tampering devices that will set it off if any attempt is made to move or disarm it.|$|R
25|$|The {{main suspect}} {{and three of}} the {{suspected}} associates were remanded into pre-trial detention on 22 August by the Southwest Finland District Court on suspicion of two counts of murder with terrorist intent and eight counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent. The main suspect admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder with <b>terrorist</b> intent. The <b>motive</b> of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28. According to the German media, the main suspect and two of the other suspects had previously stayed in Germany and committed crimes under several different identities.|$|R
40|$|Political and {{socio-economic}} factors led to {{the resurrection}} of piracy during the 1970 s. By 1983, the problem became alarming, leading {{to the adoption of}} anti-piracy measures by the international community. During the same period, maritime terrorist attacks increased, although incidents remained localised. As insurgent movements fought on land to gain independence from former colonial governments, terrorist actions spilled into the maritime domain. The attacks on the USS Cole in 2000 and on the French-registered oil tanker, Limburg, in 2002 coupled with the terrorist attacks on the United States of America (US) on 11 September 2001 (9 / 11), created fear that a captured ship {{could be used as a}} delivery platform for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or that a ship with dangerous cargo could be used as a weapon. No exclusively maritime terrorist organisations exist today. Maritime terrorism is only one of the areas of operation for terrorist organisations. Links between maritime pirates and terrorists are also limited, as the objectives of these organisations differ. Pirates have financial <b>motives,</b> while <b>terrorists</b> have political <b>motives.</b> Although cooperation between these groups is unlikely, it is not impossible and could be dangerous especially in vulnerable areas such as the coast of Somalia, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Most people, even enlightened and liberal ones, still think that suicide bombers are evil, mad and totally fanatical. But maybe it's more a case of normal people whose values and {{existence}} are threatened. I don't think we can allow ourselves to see Islamic fundamentalists simply as enemies… An opera can penetrate contemporary events emotionally and lay bare the motives of the characters with absolute clarity. Operas are principally concerned with love, but also with feelings like anger, fear and confusion - all the emotions that were encompassed in the reaction to September 11... Opera needs to be reinvigorated so that people realise just how well it can deal with contemporary themes."

40|$|The article aims at {{explaining}} {{the relationship between}} terrorism and tourism, and the consequences that the former has on the latter. Untangling this relationship may be a useful tool to understand <b>terrorist</b> goals and <b>motives.</b> The pivotal question to be answered is which effects terrorism has on the tourism industry. In the modern era, terrorism has become an integrated risk, a maybe-to-include package of travelling for tourists. The operating environment for the tourism sector evolved in a huge way after the attacks to the Twin Towers in September of 2001. Terrorism and tourism data have {{become more and more}} important since that dramatic episode; both of them are twofold and interconnected with regard to their basic features, namely crossing national borders involving national and international protagonists and both using travel and communication technologies. Terrorists do not act randomly, but they have precise purposes. The article will explain the multiform and multifold ways through which an attack may occur and be better understood. Terrorism crowds the media; it physically hits and psychologically vexes minds. Tourists are an appealing target for terrorists because they are seen as a country’s symbolic ambassadors, while tourism destinations are perfect and visible spots to deploy a terrorist attack. Terrorists are capable of using tourists as the means to get the media’s attention and bombard the world with their message. Risk perception, attitude and preferences are one of the main determinants for a tourist in the destination choice momentum. A potential tourist who negatively conceives a destination as risky may choose to cancel his/her holiday or not even consider it because of security and safety motives...|$|R
