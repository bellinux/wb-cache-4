5|$|The {{division}} of Germany {{was put into}} effect on 1July 1945.

5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

The Q53 originally was a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment between Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a replacement service for rail. Soon after the MTA's <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops along the corridor. Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted {{in the creation of the}} Q21 Limited, which was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland {{abandoned}} its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October.

The next day, the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European Central Bank quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.|$|E

5|$|Rensselaerswyck {{continued}} {{as a legal}} entity until the mid-1840s, having survived Dutch and British colonial times, even being given a special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon's fiefdom upon British <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings.|$|E
5|$|The club emblem {{features}} a football and a shamrock, {{and has done}} so {{throughout the history of}} the club. Minor alterations to the club badge have included changing the style of the shamrock and the width of the diagonal lines. In 2005, a star was added above the badge to signify the first 10 League of Ireland titles won by the club. After the <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club by the supporters, black became the club's third official colour in recognition of the loss of Glenmalure Park.
