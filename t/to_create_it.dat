5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought {{that he would be}} too busy <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights {{organization}} {{established in}} Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it</b> by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld {{and his work}} with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter {{from the state of}} Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased to exist {{in the wake of the}} arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement.|$|E

5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it</b> {{was drafted by}} two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control. Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins the}} game as the latest recruit to TetraCorps mining {{franchise}} operation and is tasked with selling as much ore {{as possible to the}} Federation, which is a coalition of six of the seven known alien cultures: the Terrans, the Artemia, the Mikotaj, the Achean Gatherings, the Braccatia and the Rigellians. The Federation was inaugurated in 2439 following a coup deposing the last Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria in 2437 and was established to encourage commercial competition rather than full-scale wars between its constituent parties. The authority of the Federation is constantly challenged — in part by those who helped <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it,</b> and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less the Federation can influence their day-to-day lives. The seventh alien culture — the Mauna are not members of the Federation and it is revealed in the game that they are an untrustworthy and cruel species. It is not known if the Mauna were consulted with prior {{to the creation of the}} Federation, and trading with the Mauna is frowned upon by the Federation.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world.

At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out <b>to</b> <b>create....</b> <b>It</b> was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Theism {{generally}} {{holds that}} God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and {{interacting with the}} universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present {{in the affairs of}} the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, {{due to the nature of}} time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism.Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>it.</b> In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.|$|E
