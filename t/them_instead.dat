5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on <b>them,</b> <b>instead</b> of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Chris Whitley (Kris Lemche) {{is ordered}} by the conspirators who fund Juma's militia to erase all {{information}} that would incriminate <b>them.</b> <b>Instead,</b> he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only to be stopped by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) who take the information, kill Whitley and bury the body in concrete.|$|E

Later on, Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken {{because they want to}} make their mother happy.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{announced}} his retirement from playing on March 21, 2015. Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash's agent that {{they were interested in}} him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout. Nash refused it, due to both his health concerns and wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club. Nash was later on approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with <b>them</b> <b>instead,</b> but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Bad Axe River, on 1 August 1832, Black Hawk and Winnebago prophet and fellow British Band leader White Cloud advised the band against wasting time {{building}} rafts to cross the Mississippi River, because the U.S. forces were closing in, urging <b>them</b> <b>instead</b> to flee northward and seek refuge among the Ho-Chunk. However, most of the band chose to try to cross the river.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus reaped {{political}} {{benefit for}} having {{put down the}} rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband <b>them,</b> <b>instead</b> encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or quaestor. Nonetheless, both men were elected consul for 70 BC, {{partly due to the}} implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.|$|E

50|$|Near {{the end of}} 2001, Bobbito {{closed the}} label, and {{compiled}} the retrospective disc Farewell Fondle <b>'Em.</b> <b>Instead</b> of issuing the album directly through Fondle 'Em, however, he chose fellow New York indie label Definitive Jux to release it, as a Fondle 'Em release under the Definitive Jux banner. In the liner notes for Farewell Fondle 'Em, Bobbito stated he selected Definitive Jux because it was carrying on the independent hip-hop tradition formerly championed by Fondle 'Em.|$|R

5|$|The Brazilian fleet, {{with their}} ships {{scattered}} throughout the River Plate and tributaries, prevented the defeated army of Oribe from escaping into Argentina. Urquiza suggested to Grenfell that they should simply kill the resulting prisoners of war, but Grenfell refused to harm any of <b>them.</b> <b>Instead,</b> Oribe's Argentine soldiers were incorporated into the army of Urquiza, and the Uruguayans into Garzon's.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{is now in}} full flow with the gas affecting the townspeople's thinking. About half the town, including Frantz and Suzanne, talk revolution. Others give themselves to pleasure. Fritz and Suzel sing of making love until the day they die. The political agitators intend to overthrow the town council but Niklausse and Van Tricasse persuade <b>them</b> <b>instead</b> to attack a neighbouring town over an incident 700 years earlier involving a stray cow. Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to <b>them</b> <b>instead.</b> In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between May and July 1994, {{this series}} introduces the superhuman hit man Mace and the secretive Sunrise Society that created him. Continuing Brock's adventures in San Francisco, Venom: The Mace sees him confront (and later join forces with) Mace to defeat {{a squadron of}} Sunrise Society soldiers sent to capture Mace. A subplot involves some people Brock protects, who steal from the needy. When he learns what they have done, Brock promises Beck he will banish them from the community; he kills <b>them</b> <b>instead,</b> concealing the truth from her. According to DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: The Mace #1 was number 255; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced <b>them</b> <b>instead</b> to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E
5|$|Aves and {{a sister}} group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most {{commonly}} defined phylogenetically as all descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning <b>them,</b> <b>instead,</b> to the Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display <b>them</b> <b>instead</b> of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Brunt {{joined the}} British Army {{when he left}} school, {{training}} as a private soldier with the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment in 1941, during the Second World War. He received a commission as a second lieutenant on 2 January 1943, and was posted to North Africa. Although he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, he never served with <b>them,</b> <b>instead</b> being posted to the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (6th Lincolns), a Territorial Army (TA) unit, having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, {{an officer in the}} Lincolns, on the boat to North Africa. The battalion was part of the 138th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division. The division was then commanded by Major General John Hawkesworth.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch <b>them.</b> <b>Instead,</b> Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E

5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with <b>them</b> <b>instead.</b> While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year Schubert's brother Ferdinand sold the sonatas' autographs to another publisher, Anton Diabelli, who would only publish them about ten years later, in 1838 or 1839. Schubert had intended the sonatas to be dedicated to Johann Nepomuk Hummel, whom he greatly admired. Hummel was a leading pianist, a pupil of Mozart, and a pioneering composer of the Romantic style (like Schubert himself). However, {{by the time the}} sonatas were published in 1839, Hummel was dead, and Diabelli, the new publisher, decided to dedicate <b>them</b> <b>instead</b> to composer Robert Schumann, who had praised many of Schubert's works in his critical writings.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign <b>them.</b> <b>Instead</b> he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E
