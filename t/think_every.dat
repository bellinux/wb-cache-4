No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> {{director}} {{thinks that}} he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] I think they should be part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E

Because the character [...] "represented [...] Chinese values" [...] and is depicted as being [...] "dramatic... close to her father, very respectful," [...] Bancroft believed that Wen possessed the [...] "perfect" [...] voice for Mulan, which he additionally described as [...] "very Chinese." [...] Born and raised in Macau, China, Wen was very much familiar with both the legend of Hua Mulan and the Ballad of Mulan {{at the time of}} her audition for the role, having grown up being read the poem by her mother. Wen explained, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> Chinese kid grows up with this story," [...] additionally likening the poem's popularity in China to that of the Western Parson Weems fable in which American president George Washington chops down his father's beloved cherry tree.|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E

I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

2500|$|This {{was what}} Wolfe called New Journalism, {{in which some}} journalists and essayists experimented {{with a variety of}} {{literary}} techniques, mixing them with the traditional ideal of dispassionate, even-handed reporting. Wolfe experimented with four literary devices not normally associated with feature writing: scene-by-scene construction, extensive dialogue, multiple points of view, and detailed description of individuals' status-life symbols (the material choices people make) in writing this stylized form of journalism. He later referred to this style as literary journalism. Of the use of status symbols, Wolfe has said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> living moment of a human being’s life, unless the person is starving or in immediate danger of death in some other way, is controlled by a concern for status." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} the 2008 primary season began, McCain's media {{coverage}} had shifted and he was now viewed as a [...] "comeback" [...] story. In addition, McCain returned to his long-standing practice of granting almost unlimited media access to him on this bus; this {{as well as the}} notion that he engages in [...] "straight talk" [...] free of political calculation gave him a positive personal sentiment in the press. Reflecting this feeling, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough joked of the media, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> last one of them would move to Massachusetts and marry John McCain if they could."

2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come eat my panties off of me."

We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm still kind of in charge here.' The lyrics are definitely a little edgy - and I'm sorry to the little girls - but I am married. Eat the panties off when you're married." ...|$|E

[...] His remarks were consistent with his previous statement while acting chief of naval operations that atomic weapons use should be treated more normally: [...] "It is in our interest to convince {{the world at large}} that the use of atomic weapons is no less humane than the employment of an equivalent weight of so-called conventional weapons. The destruction of certain targets is essential to the successful completion of a war with the U.S.S.R. The pros and cons of the means to accomplish their destruction is purely academic." ...|$|E

[...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not just doing what other people are doing, she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me.

[...] The band described the songs lyrics as [...] "playful" [...] with a [...] "drop-out chorus" [...] and the song is often labelled [...] "it's a very cool" [...] by the band. They described their album as [...] "current", [...] "fun", [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "girly". [...] "Notorious" [...] was described by critics [...] "big" [...] and that it was [...] "quite amazing". Their new music was also compared to Rihanna, The Black Eyed Peas and Kelis' music. The Saturdays also teamed up with MNEK and Space Cowboy to help them to record [...] "club bangers". [...] "All Fired Up" [...] is an electro house and dance-pop track. Britney Spears, Rihanna, [...] John Mayer, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland are all influences on the group.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Hole drew {{inspiration}} from no wave and experimental bands, which is evident in their earliest recordings, specifically [...] "Retard Girl", but frontwoman Love also drew {{from a variety of}} influences. Love cited post-punk groups such as Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, and classic rock such as Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. The band's first album, Pretty on the Inside, was heavily influenced by noise and punk rock, using discordant melodies, distortion, and feedback, with Love's vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screams. Love described the band's earliest songwriting as being based on [...] "really crazy Sonic Youth tunings." [...] Nonetheless, Love claimed to have aimed for a pop sound early on: [...] "There's {{a part of me that}} wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band," [...] she told Flipside magazine in 1991. Both Love and Erlandson were fans of the notorious LA punk band the Germs. In a 1996 interview for a Germs tribute documentary, Erlandson said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>every</b> band is based on one song, and our band was based on [...] "Forming"... Courtney brought it into rehearsal, and she knew, like, three chords and it was the only punk rock song we could play." ...|$|E
