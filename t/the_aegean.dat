5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean.</b> Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea, expanding towards <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Persian satraps (and presumably their armies) {{were not}} to travel west of the Halys River (Isocrates) or closer than a day's journey on horseback to <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea (Callisthenes) or closer than three days' journey on foot to <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea (Ephorus and Diodorus).|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Aegean</b> Volcanic Arc is a {{chain of}} {{volcanic}} islands in <b>the</b> South <b>Aegean</b> Sea formed by plate tectonics {{as a consequence of}} the subduction of the African tectonic plate beneath the Eurasian plate. <b>The</b> southern <b>Aegean</b> is one of the most rapidly deforming regions of the Himalayan-Alpine mountain belt.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Aegean</b> {{islands are}} a number of {{disconnected}} islands in <b>the</b> north <b>Aegean</b> Sea, also known as <b>the</b> Northeast <b>Aegean</b> islands, belonging to Greece and Turkey. The islands do not form a physical chain or group, but are frequently grouped together for tourist or administrative purposes. To the south are the Dodecanese islands; and to the west are the Cyclades and Sporades islands.|$|R
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera, {{which according to}} archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in {{the decline of the}} Minoan civilization of Crete. This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout <b>the</b> <b>Aegean.</b> Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and <b>the</b> <b>Aegean.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} spring, the Allies {{assembled the}} largest ever hoplite army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius. At the ensuing Battle of Plataea, the Greek infantry again proved its superiority, inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process. On the same day, across <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea an Allied navy destroyed {{the remnants of the}} Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. With this double defeat, the invasion was ended, and Persian power in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> severely dented. The Greeks would now move to the offensive, eventually expelling the Persians from Europe, <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> islands and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the Greek Dark Ages in the 5th-century BC, {{the central}} west coast of Asia Minor, along with the islands of Chios and Samos, formed the heartland of Ionia proper.

5|$|Once the Ionian revolt {{was finally}} {{crushed by the}} Persian victory at the Battle of Lade, Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean,</b> the Persians proceeded to put Eretria under siege. The siege lasted six days before a fifth column of Eretrian nobles betrayed {{the city to the}} Persians. The city was plundered, and the population enslaved on Darius's orders. The Eretrian prisoners were eventually taken to Persia and settled as colonists in Cissia.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, <b>the</b> <b>Aegean</b> Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in <b>the</b> <b>Aegean.</b>|$|E

The organic matter reaching the bottom layer just after the deep water formation event is rich in labile and easily oxidizable material and its decomposition leads to a significant oxygen uptake {{during the first year}} of stagnation. The further decomposition of the remaining semi-labile and refractory material turns over on greater time scales, by consuming lesser amounts of oxygen. A more significant oxygen decrease is recorded in the eastern basin (Lemnos Basin) of <b>the</b> North <b>Aegean</b> Trough, than in the central (Athos Basin) and the western (North Sporades Basin) ones and is attributed to the irregular contribution of the Black Sea Water (BSW) to the water masses formed on the different shelves of <b>the</b> North <b>Aegean</b> Sea. Our results and the existing data on the Turkish straits showed that dissolved organic matter is the major constituent responsible for this high oxygen consumption. The slightly different particulate organic carbon fluxes to these depressions play a secondary role...|$|R

5|$|With {{the decline}} of the Byzantine fleet in the latter 12th century, the Empire {{increasingly}} relied on the fleets of Venice and Genoa. Following the sack of 1204 however, sources suggest the presence of a relatively strong fleet already under the first Nicaean emperor, Theodore I Laskaris, although specific details are lacking. Under John III and Theodore II (1254–1258), the navy had two main strategic areas of operations: <b>the</b> <b>Aegean,</b> entailing operations against the Greek islands (chiefly Rhodes) as well as the transport and supply of armies fighting in the Balkans, and the Sea of Marmara, where the Nicaeans aimed to interdict Latin shipping and threaten Constantinople. Smyrna provided the main shipyard and base for <b>the</b> <b>Aegean,</b> with a secondary one at Stadeia, while the main base for operations in the Marmara Sea was Holkos, near Lampsakos across the Gallipoli peninsula.|$|E
