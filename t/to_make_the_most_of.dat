It is {{constructed}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its location, being open at the southern end, giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of large palm trees. It is {{within walking distance of}} Gosford railway station and is adjacent to the Central Coast Leagues Club.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Selena headlined the Teach the Children {{festival in}} San Antonio. The concert funded a {{non-profit}} program to provide school supplies to needy children. Selena was {{a spokesperson for}} women in abusive relationships. She also helped out at homeless shelters. According to the A television series Biography, Selena's fans were often minorities; she encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their lives.|$|E

25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{accurate}} flood forecasts for waterways, {{it is best}} to have a long time-series {{of historical}} data that relates stream flows to measured past rainfall events. Coupling this historical information with real-time knowledge about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of saturation of area aquifers is also needed in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> acrate flood forecasts.|$|R
5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E

5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: body mechanics, swimming, games, and drill. Another {{important part of}} recruit training was the testing, classification, and selection process. This was designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the recruit's abilities, background and interests. The results of the testing were usually the basis for general assignments or the opportunity for specialized training.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, so he had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia {{went on to a}} crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

5|$|Ray Parlour and Henry {{came off}} {{in the second half}} for Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord. United created an early chance, but Van Nistelrooy was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Giggs' delivery. The player went down in the penalty area under the {{challenge}} of Campbell, prompting United players to appeal for a penalty; however, referee Steve Bennett decided to let play continue. Arsenal countered twice thereafter, but their attacks broke down on both counts. Vieira, Scholes and Quinton Fortune were booked for tackles during a 10-minute spell. Both clubs made substitutions in the midway point of the second half: for Arsenal, Bergkamp, Gilberto and Ljungberg were replaced by Francis Jeffers, Edu and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whereas for United, Butt and Fortune came off for Eric Djemba-Djemba and John O'Shea. In the 72nd minute, Jeffers was shown a red card for kicking out at Neville. Ferguson brought on striker Diego Forlán for Neville six minutes later. Djemba-Djemba avoided a yellow card for his challenge on Campbell in the 80th minute; Bennett deemed it unintentional.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were made}} to work hard for their 249, with only Bradman {{reaching}} 50. Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores. Alec Coxon took 4/66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test. Yorkshire made 206 in reply, Toshack taking 7/81 and Johnston 3/101: together, they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings. Like the Australians, the local batsmen struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their starts; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40. Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test, Bradman declared Australia's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining. Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86, putting on 154 for the second wicket. Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to {{the upper half of}} the order in the second innings. The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result. Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{testing was}} {{restricted}} {{to a maximum of}} 10 days per driver/car, with no testing at race venues, Consequently, teams and drivers have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the test sessions during race weekends, which had already been reduced from 90 to 60 minutes in 2005.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, {{the same}} age that his brother Neil had died, Hawke had a serious {{accident}} while riding his Panther motorcycle that left him in a critical condition for several days.

25|$|Downing was {{undoubtedly}} {{a man of}} great political, diplomatic, and financial ability, but his character has often been maligned by his enemies because of his willingness <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> changing political circumstances, and to brutally betray former comrades in order to win favour from his current masters. Today his reputation is undergoing a revision among scholars of the period as his contributions as a financial reformer and diplomat are again recognised.
