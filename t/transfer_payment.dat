25|$|What changes, if any, {{should be}} made to tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> {{policies}} to address growing income inequality? The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 raised taxes on the higher-income taxpayers, increasing their effective tax rates. However, as of 2014 the U.S. was 30th percentile globally on income inequality and ranked last (most unequal) among the developed (OECD) countries.|$|E
25|$|The SM-sarja {{had other}} limits for players. According to amateur ideals, no player could {{represent}} {{more than one}} club within one season. Personal sponsorship was also forbidden. To discourage trading, a system of quarantine was in force. The SM-liiga stripped the limitations for players, replaced quarantine with a then-modest <b>transfer</b> <b>payment,</b> and introduced the transfer list. Players wanting a transfer were to sign up, and the SM-liiga would distribute the right of negotiations to clubs. In practice, the list was not successful, as both parties often worked their way around the formalities.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, the {{government}} encouraged {{the production of}} basic crops (mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade liberalization, however, CONASUPO was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems. Procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program provides 3.5million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), and which represent 64% of all farmers, with a fixed income <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> per unit of area of cropland. This subsidy increased substantially during president Fox's administration, mainly to white corn producers {{in order to reduce}} the amount of imports from the United States. This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there was}} {{increasing}} tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a {{provision of the}} 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), {{while at the same}} time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.|$|E
25|$|Östersund {{continued}} to grow and in 1970 Frösö köping was made part of Östersund. In the year of 1971 a major reform occurred in Sweden creating large municipalities replacing all the older institutions and the new large municipality was named after the city. Just like {{in the rest of}} Sweden the public sector greatly expanded at this time. In 1960 the public sector of Sweden constituted about 30 per cent of Sweden's total gross domestic product, {{in the middle of the}} 1980s the number had grown to 65 per cent. At the time it was here the jobs were, in the county board, the state and in the new municipality. The main reason for the large expansion were the expanded <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> to the households that occurred, along with growing interest and public consummation. Everything was founded by large tax raises. The entire 1970s was an expansive period. Besides the new industrial complex the Frösö bridge was constructed, a new police house, Z-kupolen (burned to the ground in 1989), Storsjöteatern, Folkets hus, urban district churches, malls etc. The County Administration board and the hospital expanded and large housing estates were constructed in Körfältet, Lugnvik and Odensala.|$|E
500|$|Management of {{many large}} {{publicly}} traded corporations reacted negatively {{to the threat}} of potential hostile takeover or corporate raid and pursued drastic defensive measures including poison pills, golden parachutes and increasing debt levels on the company's balance sheet. [...] Additionally, the threat of the corporate raid would lead to the practice of [...] "greenmail", where a corporate raider or other party would acquire a significant stake in the stock of a company and receive an incentive payment (effectively a bribe) from the company in order to avoid pursuing a hostile takeover of the company. [...] Greenmail represented a <b>transfer</b> <b>payment</b> from a company's existing shareholders to a third party investor and provided no value to existing shareholders but did benefit existing managers. [...] The practice of [...] "greenmail" [...] is not typically considered a tactic of private equity investors and is not condoned by market participants.|$|E
