5|$|At the Battle of Essling, Moustache was {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> mate. Upon joining the front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During {{the course of}} the battle, the two met and the female Poodle accompanied Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.|$|E
5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, {{she and her colleagues}} published an article reporting <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E
5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces {{the reader to}} quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> home on page eleven.|$|E
50|$|The family appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> <b>an</b> abbey in {{the parish}} of Abbeygormican, from which it takes its name, {{sometime}} prior to 1309.|$|R

5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, who claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent}} that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> resolution for these issues.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Manhattan, they prepared a spare room for Julian {{when he visited}} them in their newly rented apartment. Lennon, hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he was refusing to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono who claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> cure for smoking. But after the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session.

5|$|What Bouton {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E

25|$|High costs keep IVF out {{of reach}} for many {{developing}} countries, but research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment.|$|E
25|$|Historians claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> rough {{schematic}} {{showing a}} Nazi nuclear bomb.

Elisabeth helped him carry Kerstin {{out of the}} dungeon and saw the outside world {{for the first time}} in 24 years. He forced her to return to the dungeon, where she remained for a final week. Kerstin was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, the Landesklinikum Amstetten, and admitted in serious condition with life-threatening kidney failure. Josef later arrived at the hospital claiming <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> note written by Kerstin's mother. He discussed Kerstin's condition and the note with Dr. Albert Reiter.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to mop up}} pro-Gaddafi {{forces in}} northwestern Libya and toward Sirte began even before the rebels fully {{consolidated}} control of Tripoli. Rebels took the city of Ghadames near the borders of Tunisia and Algeria on 29 August. Members of the Gaddafi family took flight to Algeria. In September, the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid was besieged by rebels, who reported that Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam was hiding in the city. On 22 September, the NTC captured {{the southern city of}} Sabha, and claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> large cache of chemical weapons. Concerns were raised over the danger of Gaddafi mounting an insurgency against the new authorities.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, two Nithari {{residents}} {{claimed they}} knew {{the location of the}} remains of children who had gone missing in the previous two years: the municipal water tank behind house D5. Both had daughters who were missing, and they suspected Surinder Koli, the domestic help at D5, {{had something to do with}} the disappearances. The residents claimed they had been repeatedly ignored by local authorities; therefore, they sought the help of former Resident Welfare Association (RWA) President S C Mishra. That morning, Mishra and the two residents searched the tank drain. One of the residents claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> decomposed hand, after which they called the police.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 and 1951 photographers claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> figure {{reflected}} in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection {{they said that the}} reflection was tripled in what is called the Purkinje effect, commonly found in human eyes. An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zumárraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, {{in the center of the}} Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.|$|E

5000|$|He {{may have}} {{suffered}} from pseudologia fantastica; for example, he claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> <b>a</b> political party. He {{said he was a}} candidate for the German presidency in 1925, gaining 25,000 to 230,000 votes in the first round but resigning in favour of Paul von Hindenburg. The voting records do not support this either.|$|R
