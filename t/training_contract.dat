Thispaperstudies the impact of <b>training</b> <b>contracts</b> using eight years of personnel data and field experiments with two large firms in the trucking industry, where <b>training</b> <b>contracts</b> are widely used. Using two exogenously staggered contract changes, we confirm that <b>training</b> <b>contracts</b> significantly reduce quitting. To better predict quitting under <b>training</b> <b>contracts,</b> we combine the personnel data with weekly subjective productivity beliefs. Workers with higher productivity beliefs {{are less likely to}} quit, as predicted by theory, but many workers also systematically overpredict their productivity, both with and without randomized financial incentives. If workers are overconfident about their productivity at the firm relative to their outside option, they will be less likely to quit and more likely to sign <b>training</b> <b>contracts.</b> To evaluate this consideration and to analyze optimal contracts and policies, we develop and estimate a structural learning model with heterogeneous beliefs that accounts for many key features of the data.

2500|$|The {{training}} and qualification required {{to enter the}} profession by being admitted as a solicitor is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. There are two graduate routes of entry into the profession. Prospective solicitors holding a qualifying law degree proceed to enroll with the Law Society as a student member and study the Legal Practice Course. Those holding a non-law degree but one which is a [...] "qualifying degree" [...] must in addition have completed a conversion course prior to enrolling on the Legal Practice Course. Once the Legal Practice Course has been completed, the prospective solicitor usually must then undertake two years' apprenticeship, known as a <b>training</b> <b>contract,</b> with a firm entitled to take trainee solicitors.
