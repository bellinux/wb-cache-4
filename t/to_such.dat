[...] A pseudo-equivalence relation {{is like an}} equivalence relation except that it need not be jointly monic. An object in Cex thus consists of two objects X0 and X1 and two parallel morphisms x0 and x1 from X1 <b>to</b> X0 <b>such</b> that there exist a reflexivity morphism r from X0 <b>to</b> X1 <b>such</b> that x0r = x1r = 1X0; a symmetry morphism s from X1 <b>to</b> itself <b>such</b> that x0s = x1 and x1s = x0; and a transitivity morphism t from X1 Ã— x1, X0, x0 X1 <b>to</b> X1 <b>such</b> that x0t = x0p and x1t = x1q, where p and q are the two projections of the aforementioned pullback. A morphism from (X0, X1, x0, x1) to (Y0, Y1, y0, y1) in Cex is given by an equivalence class of morphisms f0 from X0 <b>to</b> Y0 <b>such</b> that there exists a morphism f1 from X1 <b>to</b> Y1 <b>such</b> that y0f1 = f0x0 and y1f1 = f0x1, with two such morphisms f0 and g0 being equivalent if there exists a morphism e from X0 <b>to</b> Y1 <b>such</b> that y0e = f0 and y1e = g0.|$|R
