40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new bisimulation theory based on multiparty session types where a choreography {{specification}} <b>governs</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of session typed processes and their observer.

The difference between <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> and standard bisimulations only appears when more than two interleaved multiparty sessions exist. The compositionality of <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> bisimilarity is proved through the soundness and completeness with respect to <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> reduction-based congruence...|$|R
