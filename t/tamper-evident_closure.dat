50|$|Weatherchem’s {{standard}} line includes {{products with}} flap-style dispensing for one-handed use, {{as well as}} products with non-removable grinders. Weatherchem’s original Flapper Dispensing Closure was introduced in 1983. That patented technology {{is used in the}} food industry by such companies as McCormick, {{as well as in the}} healthcare, personal-care and chemical industries. Weatherchem’s NutraFlapper can be found on Nature Made and similar product lines, while its Agricap, a heavy-duty, <b>tamper-evident</b> <b>closure,</b> can be found in the agricultural chemicals market. In 2006, the company introduced four new products: the Grinder NR, LiquiFlapper, FlapMate and NutraGen II. The Grinder NR is a dry-spice packaging system with a non-removable grinder and a non-refillable polyethylene container. (The Grinder NR design is specifically intended to discourage reuse in order to force consumers to purchase high-profit-margin new units instead of simply refilling already-purchased units with economical bulk spices.) LiquiFlapper is used for the controlled dispensing of liquid products. The sift-resistant FlapMate eliminates the need for liner removal. NutraGen II is designed for the dispensing of larger pills. Through its technical services group, Weatherchem provides in-line manufacturing trials, product performance studies and guidance on sustainability practices in manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|Large {{sections}} of the population encounter difficulty in opening consumer packaging of many kinds. Screw-caps in particular can cause problems {{for a range of}} people with a variety of impairments. This paper describes the development and initial testing of a novel multi-axial force and torque transducer, designed for the study of loading conditions when <b>tamper-evident</b> bottle <b>closures</b> are opened manually. The transducer, which comprises seven beams that are sensitive to direct forces and torques in each of three axes, can provide comprehensive information on the loading conditions that occur when an instrumented bottle is opened. Importantly, the transducer has been designed to fit inside a typical 500 ml capacity plastic soft drinks bottle so that it does not interfere with {{the way in which the}} subject grips the bottle and cap, or applies forces and torques, in order to open the bottle. The method to obtain load data from the calibration matrix, along with initial opening force and torque test data from two user groups, elderly and young, is described. It is clear from the results of these tests that the elderly and young groups exhibit significantly different torque and force profiles to open bottles. It is anticipated that the transducer will be a valuable tool in future studies of opening strategies...|$|R
