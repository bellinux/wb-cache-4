25|$|Wealthy Leiden brewer Willem van <b>Tetrode</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the sculptor of the same name) was buried in the church in 1487. He founded the Stevenshofje in Leiden and was also one of the founders of the Leiden brewers' guild, which had its own chapel in the church.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the <b>tetrode</b> vacuum tube containing a screen grid led to a multi-element tube in which the mixer and oscillator functions could be combined, first used in the so-called autodyne mixer. This was rapidly followed {{by the introduction of}} tubes specifically designed for superheterodyne operation, most notably the pentagrid converter. By reducing the tube count, this further reduced the advantage of preceding receiver designs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of their invention, such devices were known as rectifiers. In 1919, the year tetrodes were invented, William Henry Eccles coined the term diode from the Greek roots di (from δί), meaning 'two', and ode (from ὁδός), meaning 'path'. (However, the word diode itself, as well as triode, <b>tetrode,</b> pentode, hexode, were already in use as terms of {{multiplex}} telegraphy; see, for example, The telegraphic journal and electrical review, September 10, 1886, p.252).|$|E
25|$|Because {{the valve}} {{industry}} {{had begun to}} fade and Marshall became worried that the standard power valve, the venerable EL34, would soon become unavailable, a number of JCM 800s were factory equipped with the 6550 beam <b>tetrode</b> power valve, a valve with a different tonal character, which not all users loved. Marshall would not return to full-time use of the EL34 {{in all of its}} valve amps until the rise of vacuum tube factories in the mid and late 1990s when former-Soviet countries made most valve types plentiful again.|$|E
25|$|High-power tubes such as {{transmitting}} tubes have packages designed more {{to enhance}} heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope {{is also the}} anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the Eimac , a forced water-cooled power <b>tetrode</b> capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts. By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.|$|E
25|$|The Wheeler–Feynman {{absorber}} theory (also {{called the}} Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory), named after its originators, the physicists Richard Feynman and John Archibald Wheeler, is {{an interpretation of}} electrodynamics derived from {{the assumption that the}} solutions of the electromagnetic field equations must be invariant under time-reversal transformation, as are the field equations themselves. Indeed, there is no apparent reason for the time-reversal symmetry breaking, which singles out a preferential time direction and thus makes a distinction between past and future. A time-reversal invariant theory is more logical and elegant. Another key principle, resulting from this interpretation and reminiscent of Mach's principle due to <b>Tetrode,</b> is that elementary particles are not self-interacting. This immediately removes the problem of self-energies.|$|E
25|$|Because only spherical fields {{around the}} sampled point are allowed and the {{geometry}} of the sample {{and the surrounding area}} is not spherical, no field is allowed. Therefore, the first grid screens separates the space above the sample from the retarding field. The next grid is at a potential to block low energy electrons, it is called the suppressor or the gate. To make the retarding field homogeneous and mechanically more stable this grid often consists of two grids. The fourth grid is only necessary when the LEED is used like a <b>tetrode</b> and the current at the screen is measured, when it serves as screen between the gate and the anode.|$|E
25|$|Except for diodes, {{additional}} electrodes {{are positioned}} between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes {{are referred to}} as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass {{on their way to the}} plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, <b>tetrode,</b> pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.|$|E

2500|$|The dual-gate MOSFET has a <b>tetrode</b> configuration, {{where both}} gates control the current in the device. It is {{commonly}} used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect, replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The [...] "tetrode" [...] description, though accurate, does not replicate the vacuum-tube <b>tetrode.</b> Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly {{an order of magnitude}} (10 times) or considerably more. <b>Tetrode</b> transistors (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple <b>tetrode.</b> Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam <b>tetrode</b> or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|However, the <b>tetrode</b> had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a <b>tetrode</b> they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a <b>tetrode</b> made better dynatrons.|$|E
2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} Miller effect, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the <b>tetrode</b> tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the screen grid, could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the control grid, essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a <b>tetrode,</b> meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Continental {{introduced}} a more-efficient Doherty-style amplifier {{based on a}} <b>tetrode</b> (previous Doherty designs made by Western Electric and Continental used triodes) with the type 317B transmitter. [...] With four subsequent revisions, more than 200 units were sold in the 317 line (a substantial number given the limited customer base for 50-kW AM transmitters in the North American market); the final revision, the 317C-3, was introduced in 1990. [...] By this time, competitors such as Harris had demonstrated the workability of all-solid-state 50-kW AM transmitters, which were far more energy-efficient than tube transmitters, and the North American broadcasting industry rapidly shifted away from vacuum tube-based AM transmitters. [...] Continental eventually dropped the 317 from its product line, but still makes transmitters using similar modified-Doherty designs for high-power longwave and shortwave broadcasting and military customers.|$|E
2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} <b>tetrode</b> with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
