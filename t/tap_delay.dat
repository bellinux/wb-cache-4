The designed equalizers remove the distortion caused by the channel from the transmitted signal without requiring any specific model or state-space information. The first approach is based on the a recursive Wiener filtering procedure and is designed using the Wiener-Hopf equation. On the other hand, the second approach uses the LMS algorithm and investigates the effect of different step sizes on the speed of the conversion and the accuracy of the overall algorithm. Simulation results are presented and both schemes are compared under different distortion levels and signal to noise ratio(SNR) values via impulse response, frequency response and ABER simulations.

40|$|Matched filter {{processing}} for {{pulse compression}} of phase coded waveforms {{is a classic}} method for increasing radar range measurement resolution. A generic approach for simulating high resolution range extended radar scenes in a Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) test environment is to pass the phase coded radar transmit pulse through an RF <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> line comprised of individually amplitude- and phase-weighted output taps. In the generic approach, the taps are closely spaced relative to time intervals equivalent to the range resolution of the compressed radar pulse. For a range-extended high resolution clutter scene, the increased number of these taps can make an analog implementation of an RF <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> system impractical. Engineers at the U. S.

The main {{objective is to}} design receiving structures capable of rejecting multiple-access interference (MAI), which is the major channel imperfection in DS-CDMA systems. The use of aperiodic random sequences, albeit more practical, presents some difficulties over the periodic sequence assumption usually made {{in the design of}} MAI rejecting receivers. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a decentralized linear coherent receiver, which consists of the conventional sequence-matched filter followed by a <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> line, to achieve the desired MAI rejection capability.

To successfully compensate for various band-limited channels at the targeted data rate with a single equalizer IC, a reconfigurable equalizer topology is proposed. In order to realize the proposed goal, various channels are characterized of their forward transmission frequency response. Based on the measured channel data, system simulations are performed to identify the required specifications for IC implementation.
