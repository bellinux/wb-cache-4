5|$|After Harrison led Indiana's Republican {{delegation}} at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he {{was considered}} the state's presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate. He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his profile in the party. However, when the Republicans retook <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate was threatened by Judge Walter Q. Gresham, his intra-party rival, but Harrison was ultimately chosen. After Garfield's election as president in 1880, his administration offered Harrison a cabinet position, but Harrison declined in favor of continuing his service in the US. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session {{to vote for the}} Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent. He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service reform bill that attracted the votes of many reform-minded Republicans. Hayes continued to vote with <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This was clearly {{not the case with}} Dietrich.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{constitution}} and legislation provides for regular {{elections for the}} office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils.

5|$|The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lower {{chamber of}} Parliament. The MDC {{split into two}} factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the {{elections}} to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{suffered a}} big setback in the 1987 legislative election. The UCR lost <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chamber of deputies. All provinces elected Peronist governors, {{with the exception}} of Córdoba and Río Negro. Along with the city of Buenos Aires (a federal district at the time), they were the only districts where the UCR prevailed. As a result, the government could not move forward with its legislative agenda, and the PJ only supported minor projects. The PJ was strengthened for the 1989 presidential elections, and the UCR sought to propose governor Eduardo Angeloz as candidate. Angeloz was a rival of Alfonsín within the party.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Court {{decided that}} {{although}} there was no right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{geographic}} location, non-Hispanic whites make up {{the majority}} in Marin, Napa, and Sonoma counties. Whites also make up <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern regions of the East Bay centered around Livermore and Walnut Creek areas. San Francisco's North Beach district is considered the Little Italy of the city, and was once home to a significant Italian American community. San Francisco and Marin County both have substantial Jewish communities. The Latino population is spread throughout the Bay Area, but among the nine counties, {{the greatest number of}} them live in Santa Clara County, while Contra Costa County sees the highest growth rate.

5|$|Herm {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during {{the sale of the}} island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) {{was formed}} by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local {{interests}} to the British government. In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia in what was the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, often called the Central African Federation (CAF), for mainly political reasons. Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings Banda, a European-trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda {{was elected president of}} the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony's Legislative Council.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the rebellion, the government's National Policy to settle the north-west continued; by 1885, white {{settlers}} became <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region as the railway brought in immigrants, and their numbers almost doubled {{over the course of}} the 1890s. The establishment of the mounted police was increased to 1,000 men in the aftermath of the rebellion, officially in order to cope with the growing white population, but also to prevent any future uprising by the Métis and First Nations. Levels of crime were initially low, with the police's implementation of the law relatively informal, and focused on upholding the spirit, rather than the letter, of the law, but the force soon faced new challenges as the population grew.|$|E
5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that {{he really wanted to}} lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E

5|$|The Assafs were Sunni Muslims {{and ethnic}} Turkmens. In 1306, the Mamluks {{installed}} the Assaf tribe as the lords of Keserwan after defeating the Shia Muslims who politically dominated Keserwan {{and were the}} majority population in the area. The Assafs-based themselves in the Keserwani village of Ghazir, which became the tribe's headquarters. The Assaf were entrusted by the Mamluks of maintaining a 300-strong cavalry unit to patrol the region between Beirut and Jbeil and to guard entry into the Keserwan from Beirut. Historian Kamal Salibi asserts that Turkmen tribesmen were settled in Keserwan after the Mamluk conquest in 1305, but does not specify {{that it was the}} Assaf tribe that became lords of the region. Under Assaf or Turkmen lordship, Shia influence in Keserwan dwindled; they remained <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region due to continual immigration from the Beqaa Valley, but were forced out of the coastal areas of Keserwan and their population declined. In addition, the Alawite population in the region largely disappeared under Assaf lordship.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} {{took place}} on 23 October. She was re-elected with 54% of the vote, followed by socialist Hermes Binner, 37 points behind her. The opposition was divided between several candidates, and the perceived economic prosperity prevailed over voter's concerns about corruption and cronyism. It was the largest victory percentage in national elections since 1983. The Peronist party also won eight of the nine elections for governor held that day, increased their number of senators, and obtained <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chamber of deputies, including the number of legislators needed for quorum. The Kirchners had lost that majority in the 2009 elections. She invited children on stage during the celebrations, and Vice President Amado Boudou played an electric guitar. As she had in 2007, she gave a conciliatory speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E
