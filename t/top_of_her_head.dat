5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the finished episode.|$|E
25|$|Her hair is coiffed in the 'melon' style; the {{wavy hair}} has been parted into equal sections, twisted and pulled back, and then combed into two large braids and coiled around the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a very strange feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E

25|$|The Bride {{travels to}} Okinawa, Japan, {{to obtain a}} sword from legendary swordsmith Hattori Hanzō, who has sworn never to forge a sword again. After {{learning}} that her target is Bill, his former student, he crafts his finest sword for her. The Bride tracks down O-Ren at a Tokyo restaurant, the House of Blue Leaves, and defeats her yakuza army, including the elite Crazy 88 and O-Ren's bodyguard, schoolgirl Gogo Yubari. She duels with O-Ren in the restaurant's Japanese garden, and slices the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> off with a sword stroke. She tortures Sofie Fatale, O-Ren's assistant, for information about Bill, and leaves her alive as a threat. Bill asks Sofie if the Bride knows her daughter is alive.|$|E

500|$|In Tony Johnston's 2005 book, Neighbours: 20 Years of Ramsay Street, Charlene placed {{sixth in}} the twenty classic {{characters}} chapter. Johnston said Charlene and her mother represented [...] "the old and the new", that her career choice was unusual and her [...] "razor-sharp tongue" [...] put the fear into all the men who lusted after her. Johnston added that the younger female viewers admired Charlene, while the boys loved her feisty nature. In her book Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson believed Charlene broke stereotypes, especially {{when it came to}} careers for women in the 1980s. She wrote, [...] "The sight {{of one of the most}} attractive female characters, dressed in overalls, with her cascading blonde curls tied up on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> was one of the most positive images for breaking the stereotypes of what jobs are suitable for girls." [...] Hobson also praised Charlene's on-screen relationship with Scott branding the positive images for young people as [...] "immense". The BBC News noted that Charlene became one of Neighbours most popular characters.|$|E

2500|$|... 5 August: Alison Chambers, (16). Chambers {{had been}} placed into foster care {{at the age of}} 14, and had {{repeatedly}} absconded from Jordan's Brook House. She is known to have become acquainted with the Wests in the summer of 1979, and Fred would later claim to his solicitor that Chambers had {{died as a result of}} Rose becoming [...] "too bloody vicious" [...] with her. Her dismembered body, missing several bones and with a leather belt looped beneath her jaw and tied at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> was buried in the garden of Cromwell Street. This was the final murder where a sexual motive was established.|$|E

"All right," [...] {{said the}} girl, and Penelope began hastily {{to amend the}} disarray <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair, which she tumbled into a mass on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>head,</b> setting off the pale dark <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{complexion}} with a flash of crimson ribbon at her throat. She moved across the carpet once or twice with the quaint grace that belonged to her small figure, made a dissatisfied grimace {{at it in the}} glass, caught a handkerchief out of a drawer and slid it into her pocket, and then descended to Corey.|$|R

And in the scent of the massed flowers I seemed to breathe her special and inexplicable charm, the heady perfume of the everlastingly irritated captive of the garden.|$|R
2500|$|The cheerful, {{outgoing}} {{title character}} of the series, she becomes the student council president following her campaign to spread love over the school where she passed out condoms. She moves into Hayato's apartment as his fiancee in an arranged marriage. She is noticeably less serious at [...] "home", where she is unable to cook for herself, often slacks off and acts completely dependent on Hayato. A running gag in the series is that baby chicks appear on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> whenever she gets in a depressed or pensive mood. Throughout the series she tries to please Hayato romantically and even sexually, knowing very little {{about how to do}} so.|$|E
2500|$|Author Naoko Takeuchi {{describes}} Chibiusa as a precocious brat {{who likes}} pulling pranks. She {{is the daughter}} of Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion. Her real name is the same as her mother's, but is called Chibiusa in Japanese to avoid confusion between the two. Her name in several English-language versions of Sailor Moon, Rini, is a diminutive of [...] "Serena", the name of her mother. She is known for having pink hair put into a unique style that resembles rabbit ears on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Chibiusa's hair is apparently truly pink, and not just colored that way for stylistic purposes; its color is stated in the manga's first Picture Diary and in the poem about her in the Sailor Stars CD single.|$|E

The obelisk was unveiled in 1948, in time for the 50th anniversary of the frightful fire. There is also a statue, called Blind Justice of a woman on a long dress with her eyes covered by a cloth wrapped around the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The woman's left hand holds a sword inside a shaft resting on the ground and there are two children sitting happily by her feet: one is embracing {{the lower part of the}} shaft, the other is playing with an orange tree branch.|$|E

Guilt-ridden, Kyle and Stan visit {{her in the}} {{hospital}} to apologize, telling themselves {{that they should have}} left her alone, just like Butters said before. When one of the paparazzi breaks through the window, Spears' manager sneaks her and the boys out the back into his car but the paparazzi chase them. They escape to her recording studio, where she is made to record a comeback song, although Stan and Kyle insist that this will only make matters worse. She later performs at the MTV Video Music Awards, where the crowd nitpicks her [...] "flaws", almost completely overlooking the fact that two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skull are gone and she can only [...] "speak" [...] in horrible gurgles.|$|R
50|$|Vishnu, in {{the form}} of Mohini, {{appeared}} in front of Bhasmasura. Mohini was so exceedingly beautiful that Bhasmasura immediately fell in love with Mohini. Bhasmasura asked her to marry him. She told him that she was very fond of dancing, and would marry him only if he could match her moves identically. Bhasmasura agreed to the match and hence they started dancing. The feat went for days at an end. As Bhasmasura matched the disguised Vishnu's move by move, he began to let his guard down. While still dancing, Mohini, struck a pose where her hand was placed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>head.</b> As Bhasmasura imitated her, he was tricked into touching his own head, and hence Bhasmasura immediately burnt up and turned into ashes, due to the power he had recently gained.|$|R
50|$|The {{little boy}} (Bergen's 3-year-old son) {{was lying on}} the floor with a large wound in the head. Mrs. Bergen's skull was terribly crushed, having evidently been struck more than one blow by the infuriated husband. The {{appearance}} of the little girl (his 6-year-old daughter found on the kitchen floor next to Bergen) also showed that a number of savage blows had been rained upon the <b>top</b> and side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Bergen's throat had been cut with a razor, and the head was nearly severed.|$|R

Sweeney {{was sitting in the}} driver's seat with Brenton in the passenger seat. As they were debriefing the traffic stop they had just performed, a vehicle pulled up alongside their police car and someone inside opened fire with a rifle. [...] Sweeney ducked, and a bullet grazed the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and her back. Brenton, meanwhile, was mortally wounded in the attack. The suspect's vehicle reversed, turned around, and fled the scene in the direction from which it had come. As the vehicle was fleeing the scene, Sweeney managed to call for help, exit the patrol car, and return fire.|$|E

50|$|The medical {{examiner}} Dr. Deborah Radisch concluded that Kathleen {{had died from}} lacerations of the scalp caused by a homicidal assault. According to this {{medical examiner}}, the total of seven lacerations to the <b>top</b> and back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{were the result of}} repeated blows with a light, yet rigid, weapon, from a blow poke which was a gift by Kathleen's sister, but was not recovered {{at the scene of the}} crime. The defense disputed this theory. According to their analysis, Kathleen's skull had not been fractured by the blows, nor was she brain damaged, which was inconsistent with injuries sustained in a beating death.|$|R

40|$|I saw {{the woman}} 2 ̆ 7 s eye first, {{even before the}} breast, which {{is the focal point}} for many observers. She stands almost {{squarely}} to the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s gaze in the New York Times Magazine, only partly contained by the page. The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tilted <b>head</b> is lost from the frame as well as the body beneath the crotch. Her hands open a dark jacket, revealing the middle half of the chest above a belt with a shining metal buckle - CK in a circle. The right breast bears a round dark mark. The model 2 ̆ 7 s left eye has been blackened, probably both by makeup and shadow. While the breast mark is ambiguous, for me it signified a wound. For all these reasons, the ad for Calvin Klein belts first troubled, then offended me. It seemed to suggest that one pleasure of owning the striking belt would be to strike a woman with it. I tore the page out, meaning to object. I rarely notice fashion or advertising, but I believe some boundaries are breached at a society 2 ̆ 7 s peril. By seeming to tolerate the battering of women or the sexualization of violence, we damage our culture and countless individuals. I thought the Times, a cultural bastion, had crossed a dangerous line. I might not have written, though, except for a front page story in the Times three days later, describing the aftermath in Togo of Fauziya Kassindja 2 ̆ 7 s flight to avoid genital mutilation. The story recounts the exile and homelessness Ms. Kassindja 2 ̆ 7 s mother endured as a result of aiding the escape, which led her eventually to apologize to the patriarch who ordered her daughter 2 ̆ 7 s marriage and mutilation. The contrast between the Times 2 ̆ 7 treatment of women in its news coverage and advertising was too great to ignore...|$|R
5000|$|On December 9, 2001, Peterson {{called an}} {{emergency}} line {{to report that}} he had just found Kathleen unconscious and suspected she had fallen down [...] "15, 20, I don't know" [...] stairs. He later claimed that he had been outside by the pool and had come in at 2:40 am to find Kathleen {{at the foot of the}} stairs. He maintained she must have fallen down the stairs after consuming alcohol and valium. Toxicology results showed that his wife's blood alcohol content was 0.07 percent. The autopsy report concluded that the 48-year-old victim sustained a matrix of severe injuries, including a fracture of the thyroid neck cartilage and seven lacerations to the <b>top</b> and back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> consistent with blows from a blunt object, and had died from blood loss 90 minutes to two hours after sustaining the injuries. Kathleen's daughter, Caitlin, and her sister, Candace Zamperini, both initially maintained Michael's innocence and publicly supported him alongside his children, but Zamperini reconsidered after learning of Peterson's bisexuality, as did Caitlin after reading her mother's autopsy report; both subsequently broke off from the rest of the family. Although forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee, hired by the defense, testified that the blood-spatter evidence was consistent with an accidental fall down the stairs, police investigators concluded that the injuries were inconsistent with such an accident. As Michael Peterson was the only person at the residence at the time of Kathleen's death, he was the prime suspect and was soon charged with her murder. He pleaded not guilty.|$|R
