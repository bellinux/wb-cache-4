5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E

25|$|Although some {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> agricultural endowment to {{the world is a}} testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas. Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the {{indigenous peoples}} created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy {{products or services}} regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers {{are aware of the}} company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} Croydon Vision 2020 {{regeneration}} scheme, East Croydon {{is planned}} to be expanded to both {{the west and the}} east. Work has been planned on the west side for some time to increase station capacity, made more urgent by likely additional traffic from the planned Croydon Gateway nearby. A proposal by Arrowcroft, which included the 12,500-seat Croydon Arena, was rejected in August 2008. Arrowcroft had proposed a £24million expansion of the station with a new 'airport style' concourse above the tracks {{to the north of the}} station. Arrowcroft had agreed to contribute £500,000 to the build costs to offset <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> proposed Arena. The source of the remaining £23.5million was not identified, and Network Rail had not committed this expenditure in its capital plans.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> journeys on others, but unlike Ai, {{did not have the}} maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E
500|$|The {{rules for}} the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the {{significance}} of achievements being recognized has been [...] "tested by time". In practice, {{it means that the}} lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> work is appreciated.|$|E

500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer {{had been}} very {{successful}} in its first three seasons on television, {{but some of the}} characters left the series and storylines ended, creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission. Buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school, while the school itself was blown up in the third-season finale. The fourth season, therefore, presents viewers with Buffy, her best friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and mentor Giles (Anthony Head) at a crossroads. Series creator Joss Whedon called it a [...] "strange, sort of schizophrenic season" [...] with a [...] "weird incoherence", but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series' best. The writers set out to explore the characters' trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school. Although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons, situations arise in the fourth to separate them. The writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> finally coming back together in the penultimate episode, [...] "Primeval", when they merge their essences to form a super-Buffy in order to defeat Adam.|$|E
500|$|The Moroccan {{infantry}} {{took the}} lead, and the French commanders sealed {{themselves in their}} tank turrets and advanced behind. Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence. The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding rice paddies, and the bazookas of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks. The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué [...] "disintegrated under <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> high-angle fire", particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot. As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up {{the entrance to the}} village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards {{the southern end of the}} French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué.|$|E

Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E
