Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> just as well.|$|E

25|$|The Cumbre Tajín {{has been}} criticized for its {{emphasis}} on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any kind of cultural historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as Alejandra Guzmán damage the site. However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> very hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.|$|E
25|$|A greedy {{algorithm}} {{is similar to}} a dynamic programming algorithm in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at local optima, that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of {{greedy algorithm}}s is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. Huffman Tree, Kruskal, Prim, Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.|$|E
25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E

25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E

Zack Handlen praised the 1960s scenes in [...] "His Way" [...] for The A.V.

500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences {{of the best}} episodes of Buffy after the series ended. Although Salon.com writer Stephanie Zacharek states [...] "(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great", she also asserts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> [...] "beautifully", paces itself gracefully, and is [...] "clever and affecting". Zacharek's unenthusiastic assessments {{of the music and}} cast's singing abilities were not shared by other writers. Debi Enker in Australia's The Age writes, [...] "Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) are terrific, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) struggle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) barely sings a note". Tony Johnston in The Sunday Herald Sun writes that Gellar [...] "struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers." [...] Johnston counts [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as one of the episode's [...] "standout moments". Connie Ogle in The Miami Herald calls the songs [...] "better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker {{said the}} pairing of Poehler and Posey led to great comedic scenes, {{but that the}} [...] "heart of the episode" [...] was Leslie's celebration of Ron's birthday. Tucker praised the show's optimistic tone, with {{characters}} who genuinely respect and love each other, even while many other comedies remained cynical. Hillary Busis, also of Entertainment Weekly, called Posey's performance [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] and called Leslie's construction of the baseball diamond [...] "a sweet coda to a great, funny episode". Postmedia News writer Alex Strachan praised the episode {{not only for its}} likable and easily relatable characters, but for its willingness to address social issues like the divide between classes in Pawnee and Eagleton. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Eagleton" [...] seemed less story-driven and more over-the-top than usual, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> for the series because those episodes are funny and only happen periodically. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic complimented Posey's performance, but especially praised Leslie's birthday surprise for Ron, and claimed {{it was the first time}} since the NBC series Friends that he responded to a television comedy so emotionally. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode handled the rivalry between Pawnee and Eagleton nearly as well as some of the classic Cheers episodes about that bar and its rival, the Old Towne Tavern. He also called Offerman [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] in what Porter described as an excellent B-story.|$|E

500|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Based on 85 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} a [...] "Rotten" [...] rating from critics, with 19% positive reviews and an average rating of 3.7 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside, Obsessed is a generic, toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable." [...] Another review aggreatator, Metacritic, gave the film a weighted mean score of 25 out of 100, based on ten reviews from mainstream critics. A common complaint about the film was that, unlike most [...] "deranged stalker"-themed films, Obsessed did not explain why Lisa was so determined to seduce Derek, who showed no interest in her at all. Variety John Anderson and The Hollywood Reporter Kirk Honeycutt criticized Lisa's lack of motive and backstory. Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy called the film predictable and blamed the well-defined morality of the characters. She wrote, [...] "Unlike the bunny-boiling '80s classic Fatal Attraction, the characters are drawn in 2D. They are either good or bad, and {{there is absolutely no}} attempt to understand what drives them either way." [...] Liz Braun from Jam! lambasted the lack of character development in Obsessed and called it [...] "a chemistry-free movie". Jason McKiernan of Filmcritic.com described the film as [...] "so steeped in the formula of the psycho-sexual suspense flick <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> as both a thriller and a comedy" [...] and [...] "very good trash".|$|E
500|$|Basiscape composes and {{produces}} music and sound effects for {{various types of}} interactive media, most notably video games. Sakimoto says that he left Square to found the company {{because he did not}} feel that he had enough [...] "freedom" [...] as an employee of a game company, though he notes that the cost of that freedom is the difficulty in remaining close to the development team. At its founding, it comprised only three members: Sakimoto, Iwata, and Manabu Namiki. Through Basiscape, Sakimoto continued to compose for several different companies, including Square—now Square Enix—with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The company expanded in 2005 with the addition of composers Mitsuhiro Kaneda and Kimihiro Abe. After the huge success of 2006's Final Fantasy XII, which he scored, demand for Sakimoto's compositions grew stronger with gaming companies and he decided to expand Basiscape again by hiring Noriyuki Kamikura, Yoshimi Kudo, and Azusa Chiba. It is currently the largest independent video game music production company, and continues to work on large titles such as Odin Sphere and [...] The composers for the company are able to procure individual work for themselves as members of Basiscape, as well as collaborate with other staff members on projects that are hired out to Basiscape as a company rather than any one composer, which allows the composers to remain freelancers while having the steady work of a full-time job.

500|$|The {{concept of}} the story was that while each case is a {{standalone}} episode, they are also all interlinked, forming a larger mystery, with each episode revealing {{a piece of the}} puzzle. Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor, whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations, to match Edgeworth's skill level; therefore, the opponents were made [...] "more formidable" [...] compared to the ones in previous games in the series. Eshiro saw the story as {{the most important part of}} the game, and said that, while time consuming, it was important to make sure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error, and several rewrites and revisions: Yamazaki would come up with an idea, which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it. Based on feedback from the testers, Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts, and add hints. When creating the game's story, the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before. Because of this, they tried to make the game as accessible as possible, and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles; for instance, the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters. They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games. Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game, and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of her conception, Barbara Gordon's {{character}} was intended to reflect the women's liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered {{to be one of the}} most popular characters to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books. In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states: [...] "While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs." [...] Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections. Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair [...] "tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative—not to say dowdy—clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day--busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior." [...] Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that [...] "uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt" ...|$|E
