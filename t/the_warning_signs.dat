5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> influenced vehicle speed (−[*] 1.5  km/h), {{and so did}} the measure point (−[*] 0.9  km/h) and the wildlife fence (−[*] 29.7  km/h) (Table 2). Also, there was an interaction effect between <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> and <b>the</b> wildlife fence (2.5  km/h). The slight speed reduction due to <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is discernible in Fig. 4, where the red line is slightly below the blue line after the sign, but the effect is not very clear. <b>The</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> and its location, along with large interindividual variations, dominates the resulting MARS model. However, the large speed reduction due to the wildlife fence is probably a spurious result.|$|R
30|$|For the {{automatic}} speed camera event, the dataset consisted of 200 cases (25 drivers[*]×[*] 8 road stretches), and for <b>the</b> radio <b>warning</b> and <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> <b>the</b> data set consisted of 100 cases. Since both the radio message and <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> affect driving speed, {{it was not}} possible to include road stretches where both factors were active at the same time. This explains the lower number of cases or these factors; road stretches where <b>the</b> radio <b>warning</b> was active were excluded from <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> analyses and vice versa.|$|R

The most notable exceptions to this behavior pattern occur when bears are surprised, threatened, or attracted by human food, garbage, or hunter-killed game.

25|$|MacDonald (1963) {{observed}} {{in his most}} sadistic patients a triad of childhood cruelty to animals, firesetting and enuresis or frequent bed-wetting. Such maladaptive childhood behaviors often result from poorly developed coping mechanisms. This triad, although not intended to predict criminal behavior, provides <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of a child under considerable stress. Children under substantial stress, particularly in their home environment, frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as these, in order to alleviate the stress produced by their surroundings.|$|E

25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can be mitigated in {{some cases}} when <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of retinal tears {{which can be treated}} with laser or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination.|$|E
25|$|The {{current system}} of {{confidential}} enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in Aberdeen, with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s. Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus {{a large part of}} these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds of the women who died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of complications and the importance of seeking help.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2001 vintage, over 1.1 {{million cases}} of Beaujolais wine (most of it Beaujolais Nouveau) {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} or distilled due to lackluster sale {{as part of a}} consumer backlash against the popularity of Beaujolais Nouveau. French wine critic François Mauss claimed, in an interview given to a local newspaper Lyon Mag, that the reason for the backlash was the poor quality of Beaujolais Nouveau that had flooded the market in recent decades. He claimed that Beaujolais producers had long ignored <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> that such a backlash was coming and continued to produce what Mauss termed vin de merde (shit wine). This triggered an outcry among Beaujolais producers followed by an association of 56 cooperative producers filing a lawsuit against the Lyon Mag for publishing Mauss' comments.|$|E
30|$|The {{mean speed}} was {{extracted}} every 5  m surrounding each event. An ‘event’ was the occurrence or non-occurrence of an automatic speed camera, radio message, or wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>sign.</b> <b>The</b> {{range of the}} data covered a stretch from 1000  m before the event until 2000  m after the event (1000  m after the event {{in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign),</b> see Fig. 2. The shorter segment length for <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is due to the presence of the moose decoy, which will greatly influence driving speed [24].|$|R

25|$|The major {{reform of}} UK road signage to better reflect European {{practice}} happened in two stages. The first {{was associated with}} the first motorway construction project {{and the development of a}} signage system for it by the Anderson Committee of 1957. Although it was additional to the existing signage, it set a number of benchmarks that were developed under the Worboys Committee of 1963 that was largely responsible for the road signage system effected from 1964, which is still current. Until Worboys, the most notable differences between European signs and those in the UK was their reliance on symbols without text wherever possible, thereby increasing the internationalism of their 'language', together with their combined nature, for instance <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> having the symbol inside the triangle instead of on a separate information plate. The Worboys Committee recommended that such practices were adopted in the UK and the 'New Traffic Signs' of 1964 were part of the most comprehensive reformation of the UK streetscape that the country has experienced. Unlike previous government efforts to regulate signage, which tended to be cumulative, Worboys argued a modernist position of starting from zero, with all previous signs being deemed obsolete, illegal even, therefore subject to total and systematic replacement. As a result, local authorities were charged with massive resignage programmes. Order and Prohibition signs were almost all replaced within a couple of years, with the warning and direction signs taking somewhat longer. Few pre-1964 warning signs survived more than about ten years, and, while direction signs were similarly replaced, more have survived as they were not deemed as essential as the others in regulatory terms.|$|E
500|$|The bridge {{acquired}} the nickname of [...] "The Trembling Lady" [...] {{because of its}} tendency to vibrate, particularly when used by troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks. Concerns {{about the risks of}} mechanical resonance effects on suspension bridges, following the 1831 collapse of the Broughton Suspension Bridge and the 1850 collapse of Angers Bridge, led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step (i.e. not to march in rhythm) when crossing the bridge; Although the barracks closed in 2008, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> are still in place.|$|E

500|$|The {{events of}} April to June 1940 {{overturned}} {{the balance of}} naval and air power, as the Germans conquered Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and France. The occupation of these countries permitted the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to operate from French ports on the Atlantic coast, hundreds of miles closer to the Atlantic shipping lanes. German medium bombers could also reach British ports on the westernmost and northernmost coasts. The advantage enjoyed by the Germans, allowed them to interdict merchant shipping supplying food and war materials to Britain much more effectively, which {{had the potential to}} starve Britain. While merchant shipping was suffering these losses, Coastal Command had proven ineffective at countering German air and sea attacks on shipping. The command could not protect English Channel convoys, which were forced to abandon operations for a few months, in July 1940. RAF Fighter Command was given the task; the objectives of strategic air attack and defence predominated in the RAF, despite <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> from 1914 to 1918, that U-boats would become a serious threat again and experience that aircraft were a suitable counter to their operations. Coastal Command became the [...] "Cinderella service" [...] until 1943.|$|E

30|$|The {{long-term}} {{effectiveness of}} <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> {{has been questioned}} since drivers seems to habituate over time [46]. The results in this study indicate a similar trend, with only a small effect of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> resulting in a speed reduction of 1.5  km/h, but a lack of effect after 1  km and 2  km after the sign was implemented. Eight per cent of the drivers felt insecure/unsafe after passing <b>the</b> wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> explaining its limited impact on speed. These results are expected. In general, it is very rare to encounter animals on a road stretch with a <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> so even though drivers may pay extra attention to the road sides in these areas, {{it is unlikely that}} this behaviour is accompanied by a large speed reduction.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> radio <b>warning</b> message had <b>the</b> largest {{influence}} on vehicle speed with a speed reduction of 8  km/h that lasted beyond 1  km and 2  km after the implementation. Eighty-eight per {{cent of the}} drivers reported being made extra aware of AVC due to the radio message, which was also associated with stress, insecurity and unsafety. <b>The</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> reduced vehicle speed by 1.5  km/h, but speed reductions were not significantly reduced 1  km after the implementation. Only 8 % of the drivers felt insecure/unsafe after passing <b>the</b> wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> explaining its limited impact on speed. There were no main effects of the automatic speed camera on vehicle speed at longer distances after implementation.|$|R

The curious line 'death's second self' strikes at the duality between the objective perception of death in others and the ego's interpretation of that event.
