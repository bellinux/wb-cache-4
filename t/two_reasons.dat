5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for showing}} Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the children at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, that almost half the children at Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Rhynie in Aberdeenshire {{is the site}} of an {{important}} sedimentary deposit - Rhynie chert. The bulk of this fossil bed consists of primitive plants that had water-conducting cells and sporangia but no leaves, along with arthropods: Collembola, Opiliones (harvestmen), pseudoscorpions and the extinct, spider-like Trigonotarbids. This fossil bed is remarkable for <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Firstly, the age of the find (early Devonian circa 410 Ma) makes this one of the earliest sites anywhere containing terrestrial fossils, coinciding with the first stages of the colonisation of land by plants and animals. Secondly, these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. For example, stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material.|$|E

5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to <b>two</b> <b>reasons.</b> Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E
5|$|The six-man {{match at}} SummerSlam was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. <b>Two</b> <b>reasons</b> have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated When Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage.|$|E
