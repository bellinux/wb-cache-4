ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The South African {{fresh fruit}} export {{industry}} {{is concerned about}} fruit and financial losses due to temperature breaks within the fresh fruit export cold chain. The Port of Cape Town {{plays a crucial role}} in the export process as the majority of fruit reefer containers that are exported through Cape Town are handled by the Cape <b>Town</b> Container <b>Terminal.</b> This study focuses on the container terminal leg of the fresh fruit export process. Observations made in the Cape <b>Town</b> Container <b>Terminal,</b> at shipping lines and exporting companies show that certain procedures are not always followed in the Cape <b>Town</b> Container <b>Terminal</b> and that congestion and ineffective working methods are causing breaks within the fresh fruit export cold chain. Temperature and time data received from Transnet Port Terminals, shipping lines and exporting companies were analysed for the container terminal segment of the export process. From the data analysis it is clear that there are a large number of breaks originating within the container terminal and that the port is not operating efficiently. The study identifies areas of improvement and makes recommendations on improving some of the issues discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Business Administration)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2004. The Cape <b>Town</b> Container <b>Terminal</b> (CTCT) {{facilitates}} the handling process ofImport and Export containers for the Western Cape and other regions. South African Port Operations (SAPO), {{a division of}} the transport parastatal Transnet, is the operator that handles container volumes through the terminal. Due to the nature of its operations, it focuses on service standards within the industry. The International Shipping Industry expects this container terminal to conform by providing the same operational standards and service they receive from other international ports. Container terminal efficiency and productivity were not providing a reliable and efficient service for vessels calling to CTCT. Delays became so endemic that the shipping lines instituted a seventy-five dollar congestion surcharge on each container being handled This surcharge was passed on to the consumer therefore increasing the logistical cost of goods and services. The fact that a shipping line was bypassing Cape Town altogether was an indication that the Terminal was experiencing difficulty in maintaining its port status as a prominent and efficient container terminal at the southern tip of Africa...|$|R

5000|$|Obetz is {{a village}} in Franklin County, Ohio, United States. The {{population}} was 4,532 at the 2010 census. The community (originally [...] "Obetz Junction", in honor of settler Charles Obetz) was formed in 1838 as a stagecoach junction, and incorporated in 1928.

The close proximity of Obetz Junction to these <b>terminal</b> <b>towns</b> transformed the area into a hub of commerce, travel and trade in mid-19th century.

50|$|The town is {{accessed}} via Interstate 195, which {{enters the}} town via the Braga Bridge from Fall River {{and has an}} exit at Route 103. It is also connected via the Veterans Memorial Bridge, the fourth bridge to cross the Taunton River between the town and city. The Veterans Memorial Bridge carries U.S. Route 6 and Route 138 across the river. Route 6 heads east-west towards Swansea, with several shopping plazas along the route. Route 138 travels north from the bridge along County Street, the town's main north-south thoroughfare, towards Dighton. Route 103's eastern terminus lies at the former intersection of Routes 6 and 138 {{just south of the}} new bridge. It heads south-southeast for three-quarters of a mile before turning west-northwest towards Swansea, crossing into that town at a bridge over Lee's River. Due to the controversy in Fall River over the proposed building of an LNG <b>terminal,</b> <b>town</b> officials have consider keeping the old Brightman Street Bridge open, as the tankers would not fit through it, and the terminal's proposed site is upriver of the bridges. However, as of the opening of the new bridge, the bridge is closed, as the old roads leading to it on the Fall River side have been removed {{to make way for the}} new bridge's ramp system.|$|R
