5|$|Scholars however concur that <b>the</b> <b>rulers</b> of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit.

The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E

One such temple complex was started in 1822 (1835 is also mentioned) by Gulab Singh, the ruler of Jammu and was dedicated to his guru Baba Prem Das. Its construction was completed in 1860 by his son Maharaja Ranbir Singh. However, according to an inscription in Brahmic script (Takri) at the entrance of the temple, Gulab Singh and his brother Dhyan Singh are credited with building the temple in 1827 in honour of Mahant Jagannath.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{inequality}} on economic growth in nondemocratic regimes. We provide a model where a self-interested ruler chooses an institution that constrains the policy choice of <b>the</b> <b>ruler.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ruler</b> must care about the support share of citizens to keep power. Under an extractive institution, <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> can extract {{a large share of}} citizens' wealth, but faces a high probability of losing power due to low public support. We show that inequality affects <b>the</b> <b>ruler's</b> trade-off between his or her expropriation of citizens' wealth and hold on power. Larger inequality among citizens makes the support share for <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> less responsive to the choice of the institution by <b>the</b> <b>ruler.</b> This situation allows <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> to choose an extractive institution without {{a significant increase in the}} risk of losing power. Hence, large inequality leads to extractive institutions and impedes investment and growth. These results provide an explanation for the negative relationship between inequality and growth observed in nondemocratic countries and the negative relationship between inequality and quality of institutions. ...|$|R
