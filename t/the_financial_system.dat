5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system.</b> Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E
40|$|Africa is a {{continent}} {{made up of}} 53 countries. The continent is economically and culturally diverse, with different regional economic blocs. <b>The</b> <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> in these countries are {{as diverse as the}} countries. Reviewing <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> of such a heterogeneous group of countries presents a challenge. Therefore, to make the review more concise, we categorize the countries along geographic lines into four groups, namely, Arab North Africa, West Africa, East and Central Africa, and Southern Africa. This review covers, among other things, a brief review of the economies, central banks, deposit-taking banks, non-bank institutions, such as the stock markets, fixed income markets, and microfinance institutions in Africa. In this section, we present an executive summary of <b>the</b> African <b>financial</b> <b>systems,</b> highlighting some of the investment opportunities that exist, and then proceed with an in-depth review of the current state of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> of <b>the</b> various sub-groups in Africa.

40|$|<b>The</b> global <b>financial</b> {{crisis of}} 2007 / 2008 was the painful peak {{of a decade}} of "financial euphoria" and {{inadequate}} <b>financial</b> re-regulation in <b>the</b> advanced economies. However, {{during that period of}} "financial euphoria", the structure of <b>the</b> developed <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>the</b> EU varied significantly, considering the importance of the banking market or that of the capital market in the system as a whole. Thus, an area for political economy research emerges, considering the institutions and the structural elements of an economy that could have contributed to this kind of differentiation. In this paper, the analysis is focused on <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system's</b> funding from individuals and households as one of the three basic fields of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> intermediation process. Particularly, we discuss and examine the relationshipbetween "privatization of risk" and income inequality -as characteristics of the households' investment orientation- with the development of structurally varied <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>the</b> EU. The descriptive and statistical results suggest that households' investment orientation is related with the differentiation in the characteristics of <b>the</b> EU <b>financial</b> <b>systems.</b> However, this nexus can partially interpret -in terms of political economy- <b>the</b> varied <b>financial</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>the</b> EU, as the analysis must take into account the remaining fields of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> intermediation process: <b>the</b> funding from international and interbank markets and <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system's</b> funding to <b>the</b> economy...|$|R
5|$|The bank's origins {{date back}} to 1658 with the {{foundation}} of Smith's Bank of Nottingham. The creation of the modern bank was announced in 1968, and National Westminster Bank Limited commenced trading on 1 January 1970, after the statutory process of integration had been completed in 1969. The famous three arrowheads symbol was adopted as the new bank's logo; {{it is said to}} symbolise either the circulation of money in <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> or the bank's three constituents, National Provincial Bank, Westminster Bank, and District Bank (established 1829): the latter had been taken over by National Provincial Bank in 1962 and was allowed to operate under its own name until the formation of National Westminster Bank. The District, National Provincial, and Westminster Banks were fully integrated in the new firm's structure, but Coutts & Co. private bankers (a 1920 National Provincial acquisition, established 1692), Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland (a 1917 Westminster acquisition, established 1836) and the Isle of Man Bank (a 1961 National Provincial acquisition, established 1865) continued as separate operations. Westminster Foreign Bank (established 1913) was restyled International Westminster Bank in 1973. Duncan Stirling, outgoing chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman of the fifth largest bank in the world. In 1969 David Robarts, former chairman of National Provincial, assumed Stirling's position. In 1975 {{it was one of the}} first London banks to open a representative office in Scotland. It was a founder member of the Joint Credit Card Company (with Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank) which launched the Access credit card (now part of MasterCard) in 1972 and in 1976 it introduced the Servicetill cash machine. The same banks, excluding Lloyds, were later responsible for the introduction of the Switch debit card (later branded Maestro) in 1988.|$|E
