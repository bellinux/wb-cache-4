5000|$|Maintaining {{constant}} shower temperature: Similarly, unlike with a <b>tank</b> <b>heater,</b> the {{hot water}} temperature from a non-modulated tankless heater is inversely proportional to {{the rate of the}} water flow—the faster the flow, the less time the water spends in the heating element being heated. Mixing hot and cold water to the [...] "right" [...] temperature from a single-lever faucet (say, when taking a shower) takes some practice. Also, when adjusting the mixture in mid-shower, the change in temperature initially reacts as a tanked heater does, but this also changes the flow rate of hot water. Therefore, some finite time later the temperature changes again very slightly and requires readjustment. This is typically not noticeable in non-shower applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Safety and the {{satisfaction}} of production specifications are the two primary operational or functional objectives for a chemical plant. Once these two important factors are achieved, the next {{goal is to make}} the plant more profitable. Given the fact the conditions which affect the operation of the plant do not remain the same, it is clear that it is mandatory that the operation of the plant is changed in order to maximize the economic objective. This task is undertaken by the controllers of the plant. These controllers are the subject of interest in this paper, where a chemical process like a stirred <b>tank</b> <b>heater</b> is controlled using the PID, the IMC based PID and the adaptive controller. A mathematical model of the stirred <b>tank</b> <b>heater</b> is developed and the different control mechanisms are applied to it. A simulation study is carried out using MATLAB to control the process system using the above mentioned control techniques. With the help of the simulation studies and the time integral performance criteria, we can deduce which controller is the most suitable for a stirred <b>tank</b> <b>heater</b> syste...|$|E

5000|$|In theory, {{tankless}} heaters {{can always}} be somewhat more efficient than storage <b>tank</b> water <b>heaters.</b> In both kinds of installation (centralized and POU), {{the absence of a}} tank saves energy compared to conventional tank-type water heaters, which have to reheat the water in the tank as it cools off while waiting for use (this is called [...] "standby loss"). In some installations, the energy lost by a <b>tanked</b> <b>heater</b> located inside a building merely helps to heat the occupied space. This is true for an electric unit, but for a gas unit some of this lost energy leaves through the exhaust vent. However, if at any time the building must be cooled to maintain comfortable temperatures, the heat lost from a hot water tank located in the conditioned space must be removed by the air conditioning system, thus requiring larger cooling capacity and energy usage.|$|R

40|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) schemes are typically developed {{under the assumption}} that the sensors and actuators are free from faults. Attempts to develop fault-tolerant MPC schemes have mainly focused on dealing with hard faults, such as sensor or actuator failures, process leaks, etc. However, soft faults such as biases or drifts in sensors or actuators are more frequently encountered in the process industry. Occurrences of such faults can lead to degradation in the closed loop performance of the MPC controller. Since MPC controllers are typically used to control key operations in a chemical plant, this can have an impact on safety and productivity of the entire plant. The conventional approach to dealing with such soft faults in MPC formulations is through the introduction of additional artificial states to the model. The main limitation of this approach is that number of artificial extra states introduced cannot exceed the number of measurements. This implies {{that it is necessary to}} have a priori knowledge of which subset of faults are most likely to occur. In this paper, an active on-line fault-tolerant model {{predictive control}} (FTMPC) scheme is proposed by integrating state space formulation of MPC with the fault detection and identification (FDI) method based on generalized likelihood ratios. The fact that both these schemes use a Kalman filter as their basis facilitates tight integration of these two components. The main difference between the conventional MPC formulation and FTMPC formulation is that the bias corrections to the model are made as and when necessary and at qualified locations identified by the FDI component. The FTMPC eliminates offset between the true values and set points of controlled variables in the presence of a variety of faults while conventional MPC does not. Also, the true values of state variables, manipulated inputs, and measured variables are maintained within their imposed bounds in FTMPC, while in conventional MPC, these may be violated when soft faults occur. These advantages of the proposed scheme are demonstrated using simulation studies on a CSTR process and experimental studies conducted on the temperature control of a coupled two <b>tank</b> <b>heater</b> system...|$|E

50|$|Energy {{efficiencies}} {{of water}} heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters {{tend to be}} slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82-94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane <b>tank</b> water <b>heaters</b> with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric <b>tank</b> water <b>heaters</b> with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane <b>tank</b> water <b>heaters</b> (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. Direct electric resistance <b>tank</b> water <b>heaters</b> {{are not included in}} the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include electric heat pump units with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used.|$|R
40|$|The Solar Thermal Upper Stage {{technology}} (STUSTD) {{program is}} a solar thermal propulsion technology program cooperatively sponsored by a Boeing led team and by NASA MSFC.

The LH 2 storage and supply system is designed to operate as a passive, pressure fed supply system at a constant pressure of about 45 psia. During operation of the solar thermal engine over {{a small portion of}} the orbit the LH 2 storage and supply system propulsively vents through the enjoy at a controlled flowrate. During the long coast portion of the orbit, the LH 2 tank is locked up (unvented). Thus, all of the vented H 2 flow is used in the engine for thrust and none is wastefully vented overboard. The key to managing the tank pressure and therefore the H 2 flow to the engine is to manage and balance the energy flow into the LH 2 tank with the MLI and <b>tank</b> <b>heaters</b> with the energy flow out of the LH 2 tank through the vented H 2 flow. A moderate scale (71 cu ft) LH 2 storage and supply system was installed and insulated at the NASA MSFC Test Area 300. The operation of the system is described in this paper.
