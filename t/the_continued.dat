The objectives of the analysis are:- {{the evaluation of the}} general current situation of the need for learning (cause-effect problem tree);- the determination of <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education forms role in Romania;- suggestions and recommendations for the employees in the budgetary system to access <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education forms. <b>the</b> individualized development plan. After we investigated <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education forms to the employees from the budgetary system we found the following trends:- <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education is very necessary in any form of education;- decreases the number of the employees in the budgetary system because of the staff reorganization;- all the education forms have an important role in <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education for <b>the</b> employees in the budgetary system participate especially to the courses financed from European funds. 1.

5|$|Following peak intensity, Adrian's cloud pattern {{became less}} symmetric, its eye became obscured, and its {{convection}} warmed as southeasterly wind shear increased and the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°F (25°C).

40|$|AbstractUniversities {{which are}} the highest {{educational}} institutions of the communities are required to supply other training demands with their academic staff, knowledge and opportunities {{as well as their}} existing training programs. Many universities have set up continuing education centers to provide lifelong learning for the individuals and they have aimed to answer these needs.

In this research it is aimed to reveal the organization forms, available training programs and the participants of <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education centers. <b>The</b> organization forms of <b>the</b> <b>continuing</b> education centers have been exposed by examining the related centers’ regulations and web pages.

In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and <b>the</b> <b>continued</b> availability of film stock.|$|E
