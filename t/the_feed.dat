5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut <b>the</b> <b>feed,</b> since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

This study used the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of S.iniae and Lactococcus garvieae. They identified Aeromonas sobria as a potential candidate for control of S.iniae and L.garvieae infections in aquaculture. A.sobria, given live in <b>the</b> <b>feed,</b> protected the trout when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E

40|$|Fish {{distribution}} in carp ponds {{tends to be}} uneven as fish prefer those parts nearer <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> sites. As such, carp usually only occupy around {{two thirds of the}} pond area. Compared with more remote parts of the pond, control sampling campaigns showed the regular occurrence of significantly larger fish at <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> sites. Further, fish located on <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> sites consumed cereals almost exclusively, whilst those outside <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> sites grazed predominantly on zooplankton. Environmental parameters at <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> sites differed from those in the surrounding area, particularly in relation to the post-feeding period. We recommend that fish farmers both increase <b>the</b> size of <b>feeding</b> sites and alternate feeding at different sites in an effort to spread the fish stock over the whole pond area, thereby better utilising natural food resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{extrusion}} on {{a single}} screw extruder is examined.

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

Skye hijacks <b>the</b> <b>feed,</b> and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>feeding</b> {{response}} in Hydra {{is known to}} be induced by reduced glutathione released from the injured prey. There are several methods which are conventionally used for quantification of <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> response. In some of such methods, the duration for which mouth of Hydra remains open is measured. Whereas, few other methods rely on counting the number of hydra out of a small population showing <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> response after addition of glutathione. Recently, an assay for measuring <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> {{response in}} hydra has been developed. In this method, the linear two-dimensional distance between the tip of the tentacle and the mouth of hydra was shown to give the direct measure of <b>the</b> extent of <b>feeding</b> response. This method has been validated using a starvation model, as starvation is known to cause enhancement in <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> response in Hydra.|$|R
40|$|Three {{years of}} {{research}} trials were compiled to determine how weight gain changes throughout <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> period.

5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a distillation column depends on <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the design. For a multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
40|$|Data from 277 {{treatment}} {{means in}} 15 previous beef cattle studies {{were used to}} develop equations to predict net energy adjusters throughout <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> period to better predict gain with the National Research Council’s 1996 Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle model. Early in <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> period <b>the</b> net energy adjuster reduces the energy to correct for overprediction of gain and late in <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> period <b>the</b> net energy adjuster increases energy to correct for under prediction of gain.

5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to <b>the</b> <b>feed,</b> additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{suffered}} an outage during their broadcast of Game 1, {{resulting in a}} loss of coverage for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute delay in-game while officials addressed the availability of video review due to the loss of Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.|$|E

Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against <b>the</b> <b>feed.</b> The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E

5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. <b>The</b> <b>feed</b> conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol.

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate <b>the</b> <b>feed.</b> They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E
