500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{was just}} getting off my {{syndicate}} letter for this week. Sit down and talk; you don't interrupt me at all. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> yourself. Of course I have heard of your success, State Legislature and Congress and all that, but I {{would like to have}} you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Frenson explained. [...] "He's been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. He says he didn't {{know his}} mother was earning her money that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are going}} to have a concert and some outdoor tableaux, with refreshments," [...] said Grace. [...] "Ada was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In this case, a very {{convenient}} thing, for she <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> her brother's wedding, as no {{one else}} would take the trouble to do." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{then made}} him {{sit down and}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> this {{singular}} game.|$|E
60|$|O I say, {{will you}} kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the bust of Clytie.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} smell a {{dramatic}} rat and {{begged him to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply {{that she}} {{is in love with}} you, and that you have {{encouraged}} her in her affection; you need not contradict <b>me,</b> she <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About his intentions, as {{they say}} here. He wrote me a very {{pleasant}} letter, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> them. Should {{you like to see}} his letter?" [...] the old man obligingly asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] he said, not unkindly. [...] "I want to {{have you}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about my son. He has been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> you. Now let's have {{your side of the}} story." ...|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. Savvy! I {{never heard}} of him. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> him. Keep me up to date.|$|E
60|$|PAUL (bowing gracefully). I {{shall be}} delighted. And in return I hope Miss Toomis will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Longfellow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Pendleton! Oh, do <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> him!" [...] flashed out Yerba, suddenly, with clasped {{hands and}} eager girlish breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "At the Gardiners', and Sallie {{has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Belle Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, {{and they have}} gone to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how {{delightful}} that must be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Frank," [...] {{the former}} said, {{embracing}} him warmly, [...] "how can I ever {{thank you for}} all that you have done for us! Bertha has been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> how you rescued her. I hear that you were wounded, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "James A. {{has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> you and how kind you've been, making cakes and things for him," [...] she said.

6000|$|... "That's right; I hate those accursed cigarettes, {{still they}} are better than nothing. Now sit down and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> yourself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, {{anywhere}} you like!' he answered--'to the {{restaurant in the}} Bois; we will dine there, and you shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless me, Husband-Man!" [...] {{she would}} cry out. [...] "The Dog is talking. I {{know he is}} talking. He is <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> himself. The story of his life is mine, could I but understand. It's right here pouring into my miserable {{inadequate}} ears, only I can't catch it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Morris Hyde {{was very}} disappointing," [...] she confessed. [...] "I {{was looking forward}} to being tremendously entertained, but instead of <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> these unknown tribes in Central America, his only anxiety seemed to be to know if I was going to let him kiss me in the taxi afterwards. Explorers, I am afraid, are far too promiscuous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you about it, Mrs. O'Halloran," [...] Teddy Burke said. [...] "Bob's professor, who comes to have a talk with me for half an hour every day, has been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it; and if Gerald will move himself, and mix me a glass of grog to moisten my throat, I will give you the whole story of it.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Snyder, nearly {{exploding}} with wrath, {{extended his}} cigar-case. [...] "Light up, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] he said, controlling his anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so he will, and it'll {{be a great}} {{temptation to}} me to know where I can get it so easily. But he was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> this woman before I thought of my own concerns--and I didn't like {{to be talking to}} him of what I wanted myself, when he'd been asking a favour of me. It would be too much like looking for payment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! but {{not from}} the very best and noblest of people one ever will hear of. Yes, Ethel, I'm not gone mad! That boy has been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> his brother; and indeed I never did hear or know about any one who was a real hero in a quiet way! No, {{whenever}} I hear of a hero, I shall think of Mr. Underwood. And, oh dear, that I should have made such a goose of myself!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a good sleep, and I hope you are all the better for it," [...] Captain Davenant said, kindly.

6000|$|... "Beth is asleep. Speak low, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it. That Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" [...] asked Mrs. March rather sharply.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, my boy, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] he said, and Godfrey told him, feebly {{suggesting}} {{that it might have}} been a nightmare.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I mount a bit higher," [...] he concluded, [...] "I {{shall be}} awfully {{glad to see}} you again, and will let you know what my address may then be. For the present I had rather keep it dark. If you will write to me, {{addressed}} to the General Post Office, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> yourself and the fellows at school, I shall be very, very glad to get your letter. I suppose you will be breaking up for Christmas in a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When he don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I'm always afeard. And I'll {{tell you}} what I know {{just as well as}} two and two. When he comes home a little flustered, and then takes more than his regular allowance, he's been at {{something}} as don't quite satisfy him. He's never that way when he's done a good day's work at his regular business. He takes to the children then, and has one glass after his dinner, and <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> it,--down to the shillings and pence. But it's very seldom he's that way now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> this <b>about</b> Dick?" [...] Graham demanded another time, as {{they walked}} their horses side by side. [...] "To keep me away? To protect {{yourself}} from me?" ...|$|R
