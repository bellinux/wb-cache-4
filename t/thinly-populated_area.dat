60|$|Mr. Tegetmeier {{has been}} so kind as to {{tabulate}} for me from the 'Racing Calendar' the births of race-horses {{during a period of}} twenty-one years, viz., from 1846 to 1867; 1849 being omitted, as no returns were that year published. The total births were 25,560 (58. During eleven years a record was kept of the number of mares which proved barren or prematurely slipped their foals; and it deserves notice, as shewing how infertile these highly- nurtured and rather closely-interbred animals have become, that not far from one-third of the mares failed to produce living foals. Thus during 1866, 809 male colts and 816 female colts were born, and 743 mares failed to produce offspring. During 1867, 836 males and 902 females were born, and 794 mares failed.), consisting of 12,763 males and 12,797 females, or in the proportion of 99.7 males to 100 females. As these numbers are tolerably large, and as they are drawn from all parts of England, during several years, we may with much confidence conclude that with the domestic horse, or at least with the race-horse, the two sexes are produced in almost equal numbers. The fluctuations in the proportions during successive years are closely like those which occur with mankind, when a small and <b>thinly-populated</b> <b>area</b> is considered; thus in 1856 the male horses were as 107.1, and in 1867 as only 92.6 to 100 females. In the tabulated returns the proportions vary in cycles, for the males exceeded the females during six successive years; and the females exceeded the males during two periods each of four years; this, however, may be accidental; at least I can detect nothing of the kind with man in the decennial table in the Registrar's Report for 1866.|$|E
40|$|The « desert » of the Landes de Gascogne. A vast sandy region, the Landes of Gascogne {{have always}} been a <b>thinly-populated</b> <b>area.</b> Men settled long ago in a few favoured places, on the border, in the shelters formed by the coastal downs or on the slopes of the few valleys : the larger part of the country, the « haute lande », which was ill-drained, was unfit for {{cultivation}} and remained, in spite of many efforts, devoted to extensive breeding until the middle of the 19 th century. When at last under the impulse of the State, a network of ditches allowed the draining of water rains, it was the pine forest (and not the agriculture) which profited by it. That forest gave work to a still scanty population. Today, the decline of traditional agriculture, of pine tapping and of the scattered resin and wood industries, entails the desertion of vast districts. But others such as the country surrounding the « Bassin d'Arcachon », the south of the Born, the Marensin and the Marsan, are reviving and attracting people, thanks to tourism, some new industries and an adaptable agriculture.

5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. Lacking open, <b>thinly-populated</b> <b>areas,</b> British officials considered locations overseas. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. A request to use it was sent to the American Joint Chiefs of Staff in the summer of 1950, but no reply was received until October 1950, when the Americans turned down the request. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. Penney spoke to Omond Solandt, the chairman of the Canadian Defence Research Board, and they arranged for a joint feasibility study.|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{years have}} passed and five major reforms have {{followed}} since {{the establishment of the}} Greek National Health System (NHS) in 1983 on universal coverage as an elementary policy goal, and the Greek NHS is still insufficient with regard to organisation, coverage, funding and delivering health services. The primary objective of the thesis is to employ quantitative empirical methods to explore some key aspects of equity in the receipt of health care in Greece among the older population via two nationwide and one urban setting datasets. This thesis comprises three essays which shed light on the equity issue before and after NHS major reforms of 2001 - 4 and 2005 - 7. The findings of this thesis suggest that inequalities in health care exist mainly for the probability of specialist and dentist private visits. Income- related inequalities are less apparent in probability of inpatient admissions and probability of outpatient visits, favoring the less advantaged. Income itself is not the only contributor. The findings indicate intra and interregional inequalities in most of health care services use except for probability of GP visits, favoring residents of <b>thinly-populated</b> <b>areas.</b> Compared to Athens region, regional disparities-inequalities are not apparent for inpatient care, as well. Furthermore, the findings suggest that even though we signify territorial disparities in the probability of specialist visit favoring the better off, once the positive contacts of specialist visits are included, the elderly have equal probability to make a specialist private visit, irrespective of their income and their region of residence. In addition, this thesis finds that inequalities are apparent among the Social health insurance funds (SHIFs) in use of most health care types, except the probability of inpatient admissions. Non Noble Farmers OGA SHIF - who tends to be less advantaged - has a more pronounced pro poor contribution to overall inequity in the probability of specialist private visit than the Noble SHIFs, revealing an unfair relationship. This thesis also finds that OOP expenses constitute a significant financial burden to inpatient and outpatient care. There is a regressive trend in OOP amount for inpatient admission in terms of ability to pay and region of residence favoring residents of <b>thinly-populated</b> <b>areas</b> and Central Greece region- who tend to be less advantaged. For outpatient care, there is a progressive trend in OOP amount in terms of ability to pay, SHIF coverage and region of residence. The thesis provides useful tools for understanding and measuring inequalities in the use of health care among the older population, who are the most constant consumers of health services. It urges policy makers to review the governance of primary health care by setting conditions and implements measures for improving efficiency, unifying SHIFunds, eliminating geographical inequalities and control the role of OOP expenses as significant barriers to access health care, especially during the current period of economic crisis...|$|R
50|$|With the Republican Party {{platform}} {{calling for}} {{strong support for}} the gold standard, many western Republicans walked out of the Republican Convention and formed the National Silver Party. Many began to push for the nomination of Colorado Senator Henry Moore Teller, the leader of the party, but with the nomination of William Jennings Bryan in Chicago and the adoption of his pro-silver platform, it was decided that they should unite behind the Democratic ticket. The Bryan campaign swept to victory across the Mountain states because the dominant issue in those <b>thinly-populated</b> mining <b>areas</b> was silver.|$|R
