5|$|Dartnell's {{status as}} a {{professional}} actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated whether his VC was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>awarded</b> to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Dartnell Street in Canberra is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is {{in the collection of}} the Royal Fusiliers headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell's VC and other medals were sold at a Sotheby's auction to Spink & Son for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them off again in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the Australian War Memorial, where they are displayed in the Hall of Valour.|$|E

500|$|Taube {{was awarded}} the 1983 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "for {{his work on the}} {{mechanisms}} of electron transfer reactions, especially in metal complexes."

[...] Taube's Nobel Lecture was entitled [...] "Electron Transfer between Metal Complexes - Retrospective." [...] His Nobel Prize was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>awarded</b> to a Canadian-born chemist.
