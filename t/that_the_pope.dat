5|$|In 1534, the Ottomans under Mihalbegović laid a months-long siege with a {{constant}} concentrated cannonade to the fortress. Ferdinand urged the Pope to send ships {{to relieve the}} Ottoman siege. Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege, Ferdinand was displeased <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> had provided no assistance {{in the defense of}} the fortress. In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of the fortress.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, with Napoleon {{controlling}} much of Europe, a {{plan was}} conceived by Sir Robert Adair, ambassador to Venice, to extract Pope Pius VII from Rome. It was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> in exile could encourage the Catholic countries of Spain and Italy {{to rise up}} against Napoleon. Admiral Collingwood, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, dispatched Alceste and an 18-gun sloop, , to Palermo where they arrived on 12 August. The British diplomat there, William Drummond, selected four priests willing to undertake the mission. They boarded Alceste and set sail on 26 August.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's confessor {{and court}} priest, who were Jesuits, {{supported}} Radziwiłł against Andrew. Thereafter, Andrew urged the Holy See to send Franciscan friars to Transylvania {{instead of the}} Jesuits (who were supported by Sigismund Báthory). He also suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> should make a Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania). He settled Catholic priests in four villages on his estates. The Holy See authorized him to set up deaneries in Transylvania, making him the actual head of the Catholic Church in the principality.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope's</b> {{interests}} were not doctrinal in nature, but disciplinary.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2005, {{following}} {{the election of}} Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI, Groeschel said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new <b>pope</b> had [...] "been very badly abused by the American media". He thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope's</b> experiences during World War II had been distorted and his personality misrepresented.|$|R

5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the {{successor}}s of Christ's apostles, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> is the successor to Saint Peter to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 had also significant legal consequences. Up to that time, the {{election of}} the new Pope required unanimity among the electors, which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the unanimity impossible. To avoid the schism in the future, the Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree Licet de evitanda discordia, which established the rule <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> is elected with a majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election.|$|E
5|$|The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is {{as head of the}} Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> {{arrived and}} a cross was carried in {{procession}} to the altar. Several {{young people were}} picked to ask questions to <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> but a sudden thunderstorm and high winds, meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope's</b> address had to be communicated to the crowd in written form.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pope's</b> visit {{convinced}} <b>the</b> {{vast majority}} of Nicaraguan people <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vatican was not in tune with their problem. For instance, the day before <b>the</b> <b>Pope's</b> visit to Managua, a funeral service was held to commemorate the lives of 17 Sandinista supporters who {{were killed by the}} Contras in <b>the</b> same plaza <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope's</b> mass took place. <b>The</b> <b>Pope</b> made no reference to the incident, even words of condolence.|$|R
5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates did not know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|It was John's hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> {{would give}} him {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar University in Cairo, {{conveyed}} <b>the</b> university's position <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope's</b> {{comments about}} Islam [...] "indicate clear ignorance" [...] {{of the religion}} and [...] "attribute to Islam what it does not contain." ...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the clergy}} who served under him in Armagh {{recommended}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E
5|$|Pope Clement VIII {{wanted to}} persuade Sigismund {{to join the}} Holy League <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> had {{organized}} against the Ottoman Empire. After Rudolph's troops defeated the Ottomans {{in a series of}} battles in the autumn of 1593, Sigismund decided to join the Holy League, provided that Rudolph acknowledged the independence of Transylvania from the Hungarian Crown. However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar Báthory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacsóczy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up an aristocratic council to administer Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The belated {{attempt at}} sanctification of the Bosnian monarchy gravely {{offended}} the Hungarian king Matthias, {{who saw the}} Pope's involvement in the coronation as an infringement {{of the rights of}} Hungarian rights. Matthias {{went so far as to}} request <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> withdraw his support of Stephen. Pope Pius and Bishop John Vitéz mediated in the dispute between the kings of Bosnia and Hungary, but the negotiations did not proceed easily. The relations were finally repaired in the spring of 1462. Matthias was driven by the need to ransom the Crown of St Stephen from Emperor Frederick III, and Stephen was obliged to contribute. In return for the Hungarian king's good graces, Stephen was also required to cede certain towns, swear fealty and to refuse to pay tribute to the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|Poland's Communist leaders {{intended}} to use <b>the</b> <b>pope's</b> visit to show <b>the</b> people <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> was Polish it did not alter their capacity to govern, oppress, and distribute the goods of society. They also hoped <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> abided by <b>the</b> rules they set, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Polish people would see his example and follow them as well.

5000|$|Reverend Navone said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new <b>pope</b> was [...] "an {{extremely}} intelligent traditionalist" [...] and at {{the same}} time a modest man whose talents had been eclipsed by [...] "the showman pope." [...] He said that it was providential <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new <b>pope's</b> first trip outside Italy would be to a world youth festival in Cologne this August.

5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see to the business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E
5|$|The pope's new envoy, Alessandro Cumuleo, came to Transylvania to urge Sigismund Báthory to {{join the}} Holy League <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> had set up against the Ottomans. The prince was ready {{to join the}} alliance, but Andrew and Balthasar {{emphasized}} that Transylvania could not secede from the Ottoman Empire without the participation of Poland in the coalition. Most of Sigismund's advisors supported their proposal, but his confessor, the Jesuit Alfonso Carillo, convinced him to continue the negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. Carillo prevented Andrew from {{taking part in the}} negotiations in Prague. Before long, Andrew left Transylvania for Poland.|$|E
5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William was confident, however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E

5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E
5|$|After Charles {{neglected}} to reclaim Church property that Matthew Csák had seized by force, the prelates {{of the realm}} made an alliance in early 1318 against all who would jeopardize their interests. Upon their demand, Charles held a Diet in summer, but refused to confirm the Golden Bull of 1222. Before {{the end of the}} year, the prelates made a complaint against Charles because he had taken possession of Church property. In 1319, Charles fell so seriously ill <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> authorized Charles's confessor to absolve him from his all sins before he died, but Charles recovered. In the same year, Dózsa Debreceni, whom Charles had made voivode of Transylvania, launched successful expeditions against Ladislaus Kán's sons and their allies, and Charles's future Judge royal, Alexander Köcski, seized the Kőszegis' six fortresses. In summer, Charles launched an expedition against Stefan Uroš II Milutin, during which he retook Belgrade and restored the Banate of Macsó. The last Diet during Charles's reign was held in 1320; following that, he failed to convoke the yearly public judicial sessions, contravening the provisions of the Golden Bull.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E
