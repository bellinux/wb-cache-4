5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right <b>to</b> <b>Bush.</b> He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed <b>to</b> <b>Bush,</b> who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush <b>to</b> <b>bush.</b> However, this bird is not shy about being in the open.

5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly <b>to</b> <b>Bush</b> as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name <b>to</b> <b>Bush</b> Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E

A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant <b>to</b> <b>Bush</b> and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E

5|$|In the wilderness, males seldom {{live longer}} than 10 to 14 years, as {{injuries}} sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can live more than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take <b>to</b> <b>bush</b> and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and {{a small number of}} adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are active primarily at night (nocturnal), although sometimes at twilight (crepuscular).|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2005, {{during an}} {{official}} state visit to Latvia, Bush {{was awarded the}} Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street {{in honor of the}} U.S. president. Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007. In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Bush.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to Eugene, Oregon {{to face the}} Ducks in both teams' conference opener. The Ducks, led by eleventh–year head coach Mike Bellotti and quarterback Kellen Clemens, came into the game undefeated, and started quickly with an early field goal. Later in the quarter, Clemens threw a touchdown and {{early in the second}} quarter another field goal gave the Ducks a 13–0 lead. Before the end of the half, Leinart threw a touchdown <b>to</b> <b>Bush</b> and a Mario Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 13–10 deficit at the half. In the second half, the Trojans began an onslaught with two more Leinart touchdown passes, two LenDale White touchdown rushes, and a Bush rush for a touchdown. Scoring 45straight points, the Trojans won the game 45–13 and extended their winning streak to 25games and improved to 3–0 on the season as the Ducks fell to 2–1.|$|E

5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went <b>to</b> <b>Bush,</b> but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E
5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving {{much of the}} blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed <b>to</b> <b>Bush,</b> who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E
