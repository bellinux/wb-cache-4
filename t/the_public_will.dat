After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will.</b> Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.|$|E

General Motors told him that [...] "even if it were a better engine, [...] would not be interested in it." [...] Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising.

500|$|On August 28, the FBI New York {{field office}} {{requested}} that {{a criminal case}} be opened to determine whether Mihdhar {{was still in the}} United States, but the request was refused. The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will</b> not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'"

500|$|Whereas the {{majority}} opinion wholly ignored {{the proceedings of the}} General Assembly as irrelevant (the court lacking jurisdiction) and Brewer and Brown affirmed them, Harlan excoriated the legislature in his dissent. [...] "Looking into the record before us, I find such action taken by the body claiming to be organized as the lawful legislature of Kentucky as was discreditable in the last degree and unworthy of the free people whom it professed to represent. ... Those who composed that body seemed to have shut their eyes against the proof for fear that it would compel them to respect the popular will as expressed at the polls." [...] He also expressed disbelief at {{the majority}} opinion: [...] "he overturning of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will,</b> as expressed at the ballot box, without evidence or against evidence, in order to accomplish partisan ends, is a crime against free government, and deserves the execration of all lovers of liberty. ...

500|$|The 2010 general {{election}} {{ended in a}} hung parliament, in which Labour won 258 seats, 91 fewer than in 2005. Following failure to achieve a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats, Gordon Brown announced his intention to resign {{as leader of the}} party on 10th May, and resigned as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the following day. Shortly thereafter, David Cameron and Nick Clegg announced the formation of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats; David Cameron became the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister of a cabinet that contained eighteen Conservative ministers and five Liberal Democrat ministers. In announcing his intention to run for the leadership, David Miliband declared that the New Labour era was over, and following the publication of Tony' Blair's memoirs on 1st September 2010, Ed Miliband said [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will</b> want us to turn the page." [...] The leadership election was won by Ed Miliband, who was able to mobilise support from the trade union electorate. In a July 2011 speech, Blair stated that New Labour died when he left office and Gordon Brown assumed the party leadership, claiming that from 2007, the party [...] "lost the driving rhythm".|$|E
500|$|Although Nielsen came {{to compose}} mainly at the piano, he only {{composed}} directly for it occasionally {{over a period}} of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three wax cylinders marked [...] "Carl Nielsen" [...] at the State Archives in Aarhus, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist John Ogdon, John Horton commented on the early pieces: [...] "Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs", whilst characterising the later pieces as [...] "major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music". The anti-romantic tone of the Symphonic Suite, Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as [...] "nothing less than a clenched fist straight {{in the face of all}} established musical convention". In Nielsen's words, the Chaconne, Op. 32 (1917) was [...] "a really big piece, and I think effective". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the chaconne for solo violin, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the Theme and Variations, Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend [...] "I think that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will</b> be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards... Richard Strauss".|$|E
500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>will</b> want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E
