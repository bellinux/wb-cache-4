25|$|In 1990, {{during her}} time at Cranbrook Kingswood, Blair was {{involved}} in a production of T.S. Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral. According to Blair, it was a failure, but her English teacher told her not to give up; {{that was the first time}} she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be an actress.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert Giroux,"Even {{though the}} police decided, after severe questioning, that Peavey {{was not the}} murderer, the Hollywood {{correspondent}} of the New York Daily News, Florabel Muir, came to a private conclusion that Peavey was the murderer. In that era of ingenious women reporters, Muir <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> engineer a scoop by tricking Peavey into a confession. She knew (from the movies) that blacks were deathly afraid of ghosts. With the help of two confederates, Frank Carson and Al Weinshank, she offered Peavey ten dollars if he would identify Taylor's grave in the Hollywood Park Cemetery (which she had already visited).|$|E
500|$|Previously, Julian {{had been}} allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself, but Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex-wife also wanted to be present, saying: [...] "She [...] <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> walk back in 'cos I wasn't with Yoko!" [...] After his {{reconciliation}} with Ono, he complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try me; that's all. And as I {{suppose you}} have now said all that you've got to say, if you please we will regard that subject as finished." [...] The poor woman had said all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say, and had no further means of {{carrying}} on the war. In her <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do so; in her <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wander forth out of the gloomy house in the night, and perish in the damp and cold, leaving a paper behind her {{to tell the world}} that her husband's cruelty had brought her to that pass. Or she would go to Julia and leave him forever. Julia, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> would still receive her. But as to one thing she had certainly made up her mind; she would go with her complaint to Mrs. Clavering at the rectory, let her lord and master show his anger in whatever form he might please.|$|R
60|$|She would scorn {{herself for}} such {{thoughts}} as these, yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not dismiss them. In act <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be strong--as witness {{how she had}} dealt with that letter which Oliver sent her out of Barbary by the hand of Pitt--but her <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not govern, and her thoughts were full often traitors to her will. There were longings in her heart for Oliver which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not stifle, and there was ever the hope that he would one day return, although she realized that from such a return she might look for nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Lucy, who <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{bring herself}} to comply with any request made to her by Frank Greystock.|$|R
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a new husband from the royalty of Europe. However, when her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, began negotiations with Archduke Charles of Austria without her consent, she angrily objected and the negotiations foundered. Her own attempt to negotiate a marriage to Don Carlos, the mentally unstable heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain, was rebuffed by Philip. Elizabeth attempted to neutralise Mary by suggesting that she marry English Protestant Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Sir Henry Sidney's brother-in-law and the English queen's own favourite), whom Elizabeth trusted and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> control. She sent an ambassador, Thomas Randolph, to tell Mary that if she would marry an English nobleman, Elizabeth would [...] "proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be our next cousin and heir". The proposal came to nothing, not least because the intended bridegroom was unwilling.|$|E
500|$|Renoir said André was [...] "the victim, who, {{trying to}} fit into a world in which he does not belong, fails to respect the rules of the game", and that André thought he could shatter the rules by a world flight, while Christine <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do the same by {{following}} her heart. The [...] "rules" [...] of the film's title are its only villain. Renoir said [...] "the world is made up of cliques... Each of these cliques has its customs, its mores, indeed, its own language. To put it simply, each has its rules, and these rules determine the game." [...] Renoir said all human activity is [...] "subject to social protocols that are less apparent than, but just as strict as, those practiced by Louis XIV." [...] Renoir's son Alain said the film continues to be relevant and popular because it shows the artificial joy of the modern age in contrast to the rules of that (or any) age.|$|E
6000|$|Unconsciously {{she leaned}} upon the other, [...] Which played within the tangles of her hair; [...] And {{to contend with}} <b>thoughts</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not smother [...] She seemed by the {{distraction}} of her air. [...] 'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother [...] To leave together this imprudent pair,[t] [...] She who for many years had watched her son so-- [...] I'm very certain mine {{would not have done}} so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you quite well, Elsa?" [...] {{he asked}} {{after a long}} pause, during which the girl <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear the beating of her own heart.|$|R
6000|$|Then, just as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> really <b>could</b> not {{endure the}} ache {{in her arms}} and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in Harmon Andrews's dory! ...|$|R
500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} walking fast, {{in order to}} get here quickly," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the shelter hard by; and that the heat of his hand was feverishness? ...|$|R
60|$|Of such <b>thoughts</b> indeed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be ashamed, {{and of her}} cruelty {{that other}} night in Paris, when she had made him suffer so abominably through her {{injustice}} and her contempt.|$|R
6000|$|And there {{passed through}} Gyp the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{never again be}} friends with a man without giving that pause. Then, {{conscious}} that her father was gazing at her, she turned and said: ...|$|R
500|$|For the 1970 U.S. Senate {{election}} from Michigan, state Republicans {{were looking}} for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. [...] Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, but Republicans thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. [...] George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race. [...] However, George {{came up with the idea}} of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. [...] Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found. [...] U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. [...] And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. [...] Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Llorona" [...] is Spanish for [...] "The Crying Woman" [...] and is {{a popular}} legend in Spanish-speaking {{cultures}} in the colonies of the Americas, with many versions extant. The basic story is that La Llorona was a beautiful woman who killed her children {{to be with the}} man that she loved and was subsequently rejected by him. He might have been the children's father who had left their mother for another woman, or he might have been a man she loved but who was uninterested in a relationship with a woman with children, and whom she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win if the children were out of the way.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Genie began {{optionally}} articulating consonant clusters {{consisting of}} an [...] {{followed by a}} nasal consonant. For words starting with an [...] followed by other types of consonant clusters Genie started {{to break up the}} cluster with an epenthetic schwa and soon after, in longer words where she would have previously deleted a vowel, she began to include a schwa where the deleted sound would have been; because reduced vowels in English are generally schwas, linguists <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have been gaining command of English phonology. Around the same time, linguists noted that she began to pronounce more final consonants. By 1975 Genie started to pronounce both voiced and voiceless dental fricatives, albeit rarely, in various word positions, and when she did she frequently stopped them.|$|E
60|$|Then he left her, and {{she heard}} him walk down the stairs with heavy slow steps, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{perceive}} from the sound that he was sad at heart, {{but that he was}} resolved not to show his sadness outwardly.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Holiday {{did like}} {{the plan of}} going to Chamouni very much. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go over the {{mountain}} pass on a mule; and that at any rate <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go on the carrying chair. So the excursion was decided upon, and the party set off the next day.|$|R
60|$|She leant yet lower towards Marcus and listened. He was not dead, for he breathed. More, {{she heard}} him stir his hand and <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see it move upwards towards his wounded head. Then she drew back.|$|R
2500|$|In event finals, Khorkina {{gave up her}} spot in {{the vault}} final to teammate, Elena Zamolodchikova, who ended up winning the gold medal. Khorkina said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win the gold. I'm glad I could give her that opportunity." [...] She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide {{the future of a}} sports person. But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through it. Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia. I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole." [...] She then won the silver medal in the floor final with a score of 9.812.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{finds the}} cave {{mentioned}} by Demarion, {{but when he}} enters, he sees a strange light and his surroundings change. He emerges on Fetch Rock in 2004. The lighthouse is now a visitor center, although it has recently closed because of several [...] "incidents". Inside, Parker finds a book which explains that when the three keepers disappeared, Parker was blamed for their murder, as it was believed he killed them and then committed suicide. The chief witness in the case was Demarion, {{who claimed to have}} seen Parker heading to the lighthouse the night of the disappearance. Parker also finds correspondence from Polly White, a ghost hunter, who is convinced she is the reincarnation of Woolfe, and wants to come to the island to investigate. During regression hypnosis therapy, she claims there are four [...] "presences" [...] in the lighthouse, but the fourth presence [...] "doesn't exist in our time." [...] She claims Drake [...] "lost his soul" [...] after accidentally [...] "releasing the darkness" [...] in the basement. However, Parker encounters the spirit of Woolfe, who tells him he tricked Polly into coming because he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help him and Shaw escape their entrapment. He now realises he was wrong to do so, and advises Parker to save himself and Polly.|$|E
60|$|A {{good deal}} amused, I told {{her as much}} as I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> understand.|$|E
50|$|She {{appeared}} in Series 5 episode 5 {{of the popular}} BBC television series Call the Midwife as Roseanne Dawley, a woman who <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not give her baby daughter what she needed because she was an ex prostitute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall know," [...] he said; {{but he saw}} {{clearly that}} she did not {{understand}} him. Her face had a strange, brooding, shut-away look, as though he had frightened her. And the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand, angered him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad poor Cicely's {{mother can}} stand clear of that guilt," [...] said Susan. [...] "I served her too long, and {{received}} too much gentle treatment from her, to brook the <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be so far left to herself." ...|$|R
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. An unselfish motive. She went {{because she}} <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help someone by going.|$|E

60|$|Laura {{lifted her}} head and her look was proud. She <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play up and the fellow must not imagine Stannard had gone to Jimmy's help.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know what's {{going to}} become of the hands {{in the middle of}} the winter, this way," [...] said Mrs. Lapham, laying hold of one {{definite}} <b>thought</b> which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> grasp in the turmoil of ruin that whirled before her eyes.|$|R
60|$|The {{thing was}} tantalizing--it was annoying. The girl blushed in mortification {{at the very}} <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> cling so resolutely {{to the memory of}} a total stranger, and--still greater humiliation--long in the secret depths of her soul to see him again.|$|R
60|$|I didn’t say {{anything}} to that ingratiating speech. I had only an odd <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have had such a figure, nothing like it, when she was seventeen and wore snowy muslin dresses on the family plantation in South Carolina, in pre-abolition days.|$|R
