5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no human being had yet flown in space.

5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual <b>timelines</b> {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative.

5|$|The {{universe}} of the Drakengard series is split between multiple <b>timelines.</b> Events in those <b>timelines</b> are separate, {{but they can}} overlap. The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel. Drakengard 3 acts as the first game's prequel, but most of its events take place in separate <b>timelines</b> leading to different outcomes. In Drakengard 3, a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners, women gifted {{with the power to}} use magic through song, as instruments of humanity's destruction. In Drakengard, which succeeds the fifth version of Drakengard 3s events detailed in a supplementary novel, the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals. In Drakengard 2, the Watchers continue to use {{the former head of the}} cult to destroy the new seals, while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world. Nier is set in an alternative reality created by events stemming from Drakengards fifth ending: in this reality, our modern world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction. Nier: Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier, featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different <b>timelines</b> based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole.

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{and most of its}} levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A morality choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the <b>timelines.</b> The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present.|$|E
5|$|The <b>timelines</b> {{displayed}} here cover {{events from}} the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time.

5|$|A {{scholar and}} teacher {{throughout}} his life, Priestley also {{made significant contributions}} to pedagogy, including the publication of a seminal work on English grammar and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early <b>timelines.</b> These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is {{the final}} id-developed game, {{released}} in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of Goodbye, Galaxy and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter!—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing <b>timelines</b> between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a modified engine from Goodbye, Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of twenty-two episodes, season one follows Alex Parrish, the {{brightest}} FBI recruit in her class, who becomes an FBI field agent {{after graduating from}} the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, and later becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. Told using dual <b>timelines,</b> the narrative switches between the present, where Parrish runs from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, which shows her training at the academy with her fellow recruits as details about their lives and relationships with one another are revealed.|$|E
5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, <b>timelines,</b> and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E

In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million.
