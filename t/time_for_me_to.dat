Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room.

I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have my own.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by {{the chance to}} play with a new coach (Dan Reeves), and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've done things that other people haven't been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go." ...|$|E

[...] This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets, and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final.|$|E

500|$|The {{reception}} of Moș Nichifor Coțcariul by Junimea illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text [...] "interesting {{in its way}} and decisively Romanian", but asked Convorbiri Literare journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether. This was complemented by its author's own self-effacing assessment: calling the text [...] "a childish thing", he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating [...] "I have written it long, {{because there was no}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write it short." [...] Contrarily, the writer's posterity referred to it {{as one of the greatest}} Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor's musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into [...] "the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero", while Voinescu described the entire story as [...] "a true masterpiece." ...|$|E

500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This is not the right <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> run for office.

[...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E

Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought that once we entered the twenty-first century, it would be <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do something else entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E
