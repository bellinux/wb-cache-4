The second approach to create the COS was by hydrolysis of <b>thiocyanic</b> <b>acid.</b> The reaction of potassium thiocyanate and sulfuric acid yielded a gas containing significant amount of byproducts (HCN, H2O and CS2) and required purification.|$|E

To a copper(II) solution sulphurous acid is added {{and then a}} soluble thiocyanate is added (preferably slowly, while stirring). Copper(I) thiocyanate is precipitated as a white powder.

The ligands were synthesized from readily available 3, 4, 5 -tri- O -benzyl- 1, 2 - O -isopropylidene-β-D-fructopyranose and 3, 4, 5 -tri- O -benzyl- 1, 2 - O -isopropylidene-β-D-psicopyranose, respectively. The latter compounds were partially deprotected under acidic conditions followed by condensation with <b>thiocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> {{to give an}} anomeric mixture of the corresponding 1, 3 -oxazolidine- 2 -thiones. The anomeric 1, 3 -oxazolidine- 2 -thiones were separated after successive benzylation, fully characterized and subjected to palladium catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with 2 -pyridineboronic acid N -phenyldiethanolamine ester to give the corresponding 2 -pyridyl spiro-oxazoline (PyOx) ligands. The spiro-oxazoline ligands showed high asymmetric induction (up to 93 % ee) when applied as chiral ligands in palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of 1, 3 -diphenylallyl acetate with dimethyl malonate. The D- fructo -PyOx ligand provided mainly the (R) -enantiomer while the D- psico -configurated ligand gave the (S) -enantiomer with a lower enantiomeric excess...|$|E
40|$|Plants emit various {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) upon herbivore attack. These VOC emissions often show temporal dynamics which may influence the behavior of natural enemies using these volatiles as cues. This study analyzes on-line VOC emissions by roots of Brassica nigra plants under attack by cabbage root fly larvae. Delia radicum. Root emitted VOCs were detected using Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). These analyses showed that several sulfur containing compounds, such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) and glucosinolate breakdown products, such as thiocyanates (TC) and isothiocyanates (ITC), were emitted by the roots in response to infestation. The emissions were subdivided into early responses, emerging within 1 - 6 h after infestation, and late responses, evolving only after 6 - 12 h. The marker for rapid responses was detected at m/z 60. The ion detected at m/z 60 was identified as <b>thiocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{which is also a}} prominent fragment in some TC or ITC spectra. The emission of m/z 60 stopped when the larvae had pupated, which makes it an excellent indicator for actively feeding larvae. Methanethiol. DMS and DMDS levels increased much later in infested roots, indicating that activation of enzymes or genes involved in the production of these compounds may be required. Earlier studies have shown that both early and late responses can play a role in tritrophic interactions associated with Brassica species. Moreover, the identification of these root induced responses will help to design non-invasive analytical procedures to assess root infestations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
