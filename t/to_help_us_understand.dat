500|$|In September 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez {{held up a}} Spanish-language copy of Hegemony or Survival {{during his}} speech at the United Nations. Chávez praised the work as an [...] "excellent book <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> what has been {{happening}} in the world throughout the 20th century". He urged everyone present to read it, including those in the U.S., remarking that [...] "I think that the first people who should read this book are our brothers and sisters in the United States, because their threat is right in their own house." [...] A vocal anti-imperialist and prominent critic of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in his native Latin America, Chávez went on to describe U.S. President Bush as the [...] "devil" [...] in his speech.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. Clark says that [...] "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E

[...] Studying how people dealt with animals, and its effects can <b>help</b> <b>us</b> avoid many potential ecological problems. [...] This specifically includes problems involving wildlife management. [...] For example, {{one of the questions that}} wildlife preservationists ask is whether they should keep animals facing extinction in several smaller areas, or in one larger area. [...] Based on zooarchaeological evidence, they found that animals that are split up into several smaller areas are more likely to go extinct.|$|R

This article analyses 15 systematically selected national cases of demonstrated rapid poverty reduction, seeking insights into effective approaches to reducing poverty. From these 15 economies, in which the bottom quintile experienced an annual increase in income of at least 6 % over at least a decade, emerge four poverty-reduction pathways: (1) industrialisation, (2) rural development, (3) social welfare and (4) petroleum-generated employment. In addition <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> what policy approaches have actually helped reduce poverty, this article has implications for the understanding of economic growth, the impact of pro-growth policies, the relationship between state and market, and the roles of non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society...|$|R

40|$|Patterns {{of human}} encounters, which are {{difficult}} to observe directly, are fundamental to the propagation of mobile malware aimed at infecting devices in spatial proximity. We investigate errors introduced by using scanners that detect the presence of devices {{on the assumption that}} device copresence at a scanner corresponds to a device encounter. We show in an ideal static model that only 59 % of inferred encounters correspond to actual device copresence. To investigate the effects of mobility, we use a simulator to compare encounters between devices with those inferred by scanners. We show that the statistical properties of scanned encounters differ from actual device encounters in ways which impact malware propagation dynamics, a form of aggressive data dissemination. In addition <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the limitations of encounter data gathered by scanners in the field, our use of virtual scanners suggests a practical method for using these empirical datasets to better inform simulations of proximity malware outbreaks and similar data dissemination applications...|$|R
40|$|Axel Leijonhufvud's On Keynesian Economics and the Economics of Keynes (1968) was {{a seminal}} {{contribution}} to the literature on {{what came to be}} known as the micro-foundations of macro-economics, but its Marshallian approach, which involved analysing the disequilibrium dynamics of markets in which trade at non-market clearing prices would occur, was not that eventually adopted in the early 1970 s. Instead, a Walrasian development of monetarism, namely new- classical macroeconomics, which combined the postulate of continuously clearing markets with the rational expectations hypothesis became dominant. Even so, Leijonhufvud's subsequent work on the costs of inflation had an important influence in establishing this phenomenon's policy importance, and, along with his earlier analysis of employment fluctuations, provides still important insights about why the relevance of now-orthodox economics might be limited <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the economy's performance within a corridor whose boundaries lie close to its full-employment-price-stability equilibrium. macroeconomics; micro-foundations; Keynesian economics; monetarism; new-classical economics; general equilibrium; disequilibrium; auctioneer; false prices; money; unemployment; inflation...|$|R

His first book, 'Red Horizons,'is indubitably the most brilliant portrait of a Communist regime I've ever read. 'Programmed to Kill' is equally fascinating. Pacepa painstakingly takes us through the documentary evidence, including invaluable material on Soviet bloc cyphers that throws new light on Oswald's letters to KGB officers in Washington and Mexico City. … No novelist could have written a more exciting story, made all the more compelling because of Pacepa's first-hand involvement in the Russians' efforts to hide their Oswald connection." ...|$|R
