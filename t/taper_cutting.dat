Wire electro discharge machining (WEDM) is one, mostly acceptable non-conventional machining processes, using fewer tools; ease machining and producing extreme accurate shapes in hard materials those using in the tooling industry where the extreme precision is required and complexly determines such as extrusion dies in wear-resistant materials, cutting dies, etc. Wire EDM <b>Taper</b> <b>cutting</b> took forward the generation of inclined ruled surfaces, and it is eminently {{more important in the}} manufacturing of tooling requiring draft angles. The required angle is reached by applying a relative moment between the lower guide and the upper guide. Deformation arises in the wire, during the machining of <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> using Wire EDM. Due to that deformation in the wire, effected to the ruled inclination of machined parts. Such circumstances cause a dimensional error, loss of tolerances and less precision that can prime to the rejection of high added value tooling. To predict the deformation of wire by considering contact mechanics, properties of wire, properties of the guide, boundary conditions, typically used in <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> operations, has been taking into the account. FEM is needed to reduce the experimental cost and lack of time consumption and to give a more common approach to the problem.

40|$|Significant {{technological}} advancement of wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) process has been observed in recent times {{in order to meet the}} requirements of various manufacturing fields especially in the production of parts with complex geometry in precision die industry. <b>Taper</b> <b>cutting</b> is an important application of WEDM process aiming at generating complex parts with tapered profiles. Wire deformation and breakage are more pronounced in <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> as compared with straight cutting resulting in adverse effect on desired taper angle and surface integrity. The reasons for associated problems may be attributed to certain stiffness of the wire. However, controlling the process parameters can somewhat reduce these problems. Extensive literature review reveals that effect of process parameters on various performance measures in <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> using WEDM is also not adequately addressed. Hence, study on effect of process parameters on performance measures using various advanced metals and metal matrix composites (MMC) has become the predominant research area in this field. In this context, the present work attempts to experimentally investigate the machining performance of various alloys, super alloys and metal matrix composite during <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> using WEDM process. The effect of process parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension on various performance measures such as angular error, surface roughness, cutting rate and white layer thickness are studied using Taguchi’s analysis. The functional relationship between the input parameters and performance measures has been developed by using non-linear regression analysis. Simultaneous optimization of the performance measures has been carried out using latest nature inspired algorithms such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and bat algorithm. Although MOPSO develops a set of non-dominated solutions, the best ranked solution is identified from a large number of solutions through application of maximum deviation method rather than resorting to human judgement. Deep cryogenic treatment of both wire and work material has been carried out to enhance the machining efficiency of the low conductive work material like Inconel 718. Finally, artificial intelligent models are proposed to predict the various performance measures prior to machining. The study offers useful insight into controlling the parameters to improve the machining efficiency...|$|E

Experiments have been conducted using six process parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension each at three levels for obtaining the responses like angular error, surface roughness, and cutting speed. Taguchi's L 27 orthogonal array is used to gather information regarding the process with less number of experimental runs. Traditional Taguchi approach is insufficient to solve a multi response optimization problem. In order to overcome this limitation, utility theory has been implemented, to convert multi-responses into single equivalent response called overall utility index. The weight for each criterion (response) is obtained by analytical hierarchy process (AHP) instead of using intuition and judgement of the decision maker.

40|$|AbstractThe present work proposes an {{experimental}} investigation and optimization of various process parameters during <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> of deep cryo-treated Inconel 718 in wire {{electrical discharge machining}} process. Taguchi's design of experiment is used to gather information regarding the process with less number of experimental runs considering six input parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension. Since traditional Taguchi method fails to optimize multiple performance characteristics, maximum deviation theory is applied to convert multiple performance characteristics into an equivalent single performance characteristic. Due to the complexity and non-linearity involved in this process, good functional relationship with reasonable accuracy between performance characteristics and process parameters is difficult to obtain. To address this issue, the present study proposes artificial neural network (ANN) model to determine the relationship between input parameters and performance characteristics. Finally, the process model is optimized to obtain a best parametric combination by a new meta-heuristic approach known as bat algorithm. The results of the proposed algorithm show that the proposed method is an effective tool for simultaneous optimization of performance characteristics during <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> in WEDM process...|$|E

The spreading continues beyond that a conventional goniometer can measure. Such thinness allows NDCF to penetrate deep into the tool-chip and tool-workpiece interfaces to affect the lubrication. In this paper, straight <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> was carried out using a single-point diamond tool. By examining the groove machined, the enhancement effect of NDCF on improving the surface roughness, reducing bouncing back, and suppressing form irregularities could be quantified. Without NDCF, form irregularities {{were found on the}} surface of the grooves in the nature of random localized upheavals. For shallow cuts, NDCF could stabilize the cutting with a depth of cut (DoC) below 1 mu m and down to around 0. 75 mu m, so that the roundness of the machined groove could be maintained precisely. Whereas for deeper cuts, NDCF was found to be effective in preventing form irregularities and on reducing bounce back for a DoC larger than 1. 5 mu m. Regarding bounce back, the experimental work revealed that NDCF can prevent form irregularities from occurring when the DoC is beyond 1. 5 mu m. For those samples machined using a conventional oil lubricant, distorted rebounding with a magnitude as large as 200 nm was not uncommon. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

Much {{attention has been}} paid to the ductile regime machining of SiC in recent years, but there is still controversy regarding the mechanism of its ductile response in ultraprecision machining. While some researchers proposed the high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) theory from experimental studies on 6 H SiC, later molecular dynamics (MD) studies disapproving the HPPT theory adopted 3 C SiC as the workpiece. This study conducts MD simulations to investigate the atomicscale details of ductile deformation in the machining of 6 H SiC for the first time, using an interaction potential that can reproduce the HPPT of SiC. The HPPT in the machining of 6 H SiC are visualized for the first time by MD simulations, although the quantity of HPPT is very small. The dislocation structures in the machining of 6 H SiC are also visualized by MD for the first time. Frank partial dislocations and basal plane edge dislocations are identified to be primarily responsible for the ductile deformation. <b>Taper</b> <b>cutting</b> experiment on a single crystal 6 H SiC wafer produces a ductile-cut surface, and micro Raman spectroscopy on the machined surface finds no peaks for amorphous SiC, which agrees with the MD result that the quantity of HPPT is very small.

30|$|Wire {{electric}} discharge machining (WEDM) process {{has opened a}} new swing in the manufacturing sector. Non-traditional machining processes changed the whole scenario of manufacturing industries. Traditional machining processes are rapidly replaced by non-traditional methods for achieving better production rates and quality. One of the successful methods is WEDM, {{which is based on}} the conventional {{electric discharge}} machining (EDM). The principle remains the same for WEDM as in conventional EDM, a thermo-electrical process. WEDM process involves the erosion effect by rapid repetitive and discrete spark discharges between the wire tool electrode and work piece in a liquid dielectric medium. Manufacturing the parts of high quality at high production efficiency is the main objective of WEDM process. Selecting the appropriate machining parameter for high quality product is very difficult. Much research is not found in the field of WEDM to find the optimum parameter; in the present research, GRA is used to find the response variable of WEDM. An attempt is made by Majhi et al. (2013) for the determination of the optimal process parameters material removal rate, surface roughness and tool wear rate for EDM process. Modelling and optimisation of WEDM were given by Kumar and Kumar (2013). To find the optimum surface roughness, they used to input parameters such as Time On, Time Off, Wire Speed and Wire Feed. Taguchi techniques have been used for optimisation of minimizing the SR. Due to multiple variables, an extremely trained operator with a modern WEDM is rarely to achieve the optimal performance. Pasam et al. (2010) conducted research to solve this problem to determine the relation among the responses and its parameter. The most important responses in WEDM are metal removal rate, workpiece’s surface finish, and kerf width. Discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, and dielectric flow rate are some of the machining parameters which affect the responses. The gap between the wire and work piece is also an important in wire EDM and it usually ranges from 0.02 to 0.075  mm given by Mahapatra and Patnaik (2007). Taguchi-based Grey relational analysis, to find the optimal process parameter setting for multi-matrix composite using molybdenum wire of 0.18  mm diameter, as electrode is applied by Lal et al. (2015). Similar technique for optimisation was used by Shivade and Shinde (2014) for D 3 tool steel material. Nayak and Mahapatra (2016) applied an artificial neural network (ANN) model to determine the relationship between input parameters and performance characteristics for <b>taper</b> <b>cutting</b> of deep cryo-treated Inconel 718 with cryo-treated coated Bronco cut-W. In wire electrical discharge machining process 0.2 mm diameter wire electrode was used. Jaganathan et al. (2012) optimised the wire EDM parameter and responses MRR and surface finish for EN 31 is done by Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array (OA). Singha and Pradhan (2014) conducted experiment through Taguchi method and response surface methodology is applied to estimate the optimum machining condition within the experimental constraints. Varun and Venkaiah (2014) used an optimisation strategy by coupling Grey relational analysis (GRA) with genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise the response parameters. Experiments were conducted on EN- 353 work material to study the effects of input parameters. Zinc-coated copper wire with 0.25 mm diameter is used as an electrode. The response parameter such as material removal rate (MRR), the surface roughness (SR), and kerf width is observed. Saha and Mondal (2016) applied an optimisation technique combining Grey relational analysis with principal component analysis to identify the optimal combination of process parameters in WEDM for machining nanostructured hard facing materials. Sinha et al. (2015) used Taguchi method for single objective optimisation and then the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios obtained from Taguchi method have been further used in principal component analysis (PCA) for multi-objective optimisation. Huang and Liao (2003) applied Grey relational analyses with L 18 mixed orthogonal array to determine the optimal selection of machining parameters for the wire electrical discharge machining process. Baig and Vankaiah (2001) applied Taguchi and Grey relation analysis to find the optimal parameter settings for WEDM for a nickel-based alloy.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} on the AWJ cutting technology and associated sciences {{has been carried}} out and reported. It has been found that little research effort has been made to the AWJ cutting process for AMM laminations. As a result, the first comprehensive study on AWJ cutting of AMM laminations using various cutting techniques is presented in this thesis, with a view to understanding and improving the cutting performance, i. e. the depth of cut, the top kerf width and the kerf taper angle. An experimental study in the traditional way of AWJ operation (i. e. placing the nozzle perpendicularly to the work surface without nozzle oscillation) was carried out first to gain the basic understanding of the cutting process and cutting performance. Studies with cutting performance enhancement techniques, i. e. the nozzle oscillation and kerf taper compensation techniques, were then undertaken. The experimental studies included about 200 test runs to provide sufficient data for statistical analysis. Plausible trends of the cutting performance measures with respect to the process parameters have been found from the statistical analyses of the experimental data. In general, an increase in the water pressure and a decrease in the nozzle traverse speed and abrasive mass flow rate within the tested ranges increase the depth of cut. An increase in the kerf taper compensation angle decreases the kerf taper angle almost linearly. Nozzle oscillation cutting can reduce the kerf taper angle to less than 1 o, and the kerf <b>taper</b> compensation <b>cutting</b> technique can eliminate the kerf taper if the process parameters are properly selected. Recommendations have been made on the selection of the most appropriate process parameters to be used in practice for each cutting technique. Predictive models for the various cutting performance measures have finally been developed. The depth of cut models were developed using the energy conservation approach, while those for the top kerf width and kerf taper angle were developed empirically. The models were then assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. It has been found that the model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data and can give adequate predictions of the cutting performance measures...|$|R

The thesis discuss the experimental analysis to predict the effect of the process parameter on kerf width and taper on acrylic sheet. The work piece {{that we are going to}} use in the experiment is acrylic sheet that is also known by trade names such as Plexiglas, Acrylite, and Lucite which is commonly used in industry. This material is great for glazing, windows, cutting boards, or anywhere a clear material is needed. Besides that, it is also has better optical clarity than glass, light weight, good impact strength and clear. As mentioned, the experiments is conduct using laser beam cutting machine. The specimen is cut in square shape then a slit is made through the center of specimen to determine the kerf width and taper. From the results, it is observed that the parameter set in the experiment on laser beam cutting had effect on kerf width and taper. Secondly, the cuffing speed, nozzle gap and laser power gives major impact on kerf width and taper. The kerf width and taper will increase considerably with the increase of laser power and nozzle gap and decreasing the cutting speed. The cutting angle and air pressure also gives some effect on kerf width and <b>taper.</b> Increasing <b>cutting</b> angle and air pressure will slightly increase the kerf width and taper.
