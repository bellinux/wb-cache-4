5|$|In December 2010, the Western New York Flash, {{previously}} {{part of the}} W-League, {{joined the}} WPS for the 2011 season. Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> announced they had signed Harris. She appeared in the team's debut in the league on April 17, 2011 against the Boston Breakers. She made eighteen appearances for <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> in the regular season, allowing eighteen goals and helping <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> rank number one {{at the end of}} the season. Harris made the start in the 2011 WPS Championship on August 27, 2011 against the Philadelphia Independence. The game was tied 1–1 after regulation and extra time, leaving the outcome of the match to be decided by penalty kicks. Both the Independence and <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> made their first four shots. However, Harris blocked the shot by Philadelphia's Laura del Rio, clinching the championship for <b>the</b> <b>Flash.</b> She was named the 2011 Coast Guard Goalkeeper of the Year following a successful 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd {{finished}} the 2013 season with 10 goals, {{the third most}} goals scored on the season. <b>The</b> <b>Flash</b> finished first {{during the regular season}} with a 10–8–4 record and advanced to the playoffs. During the Flash's semifinal match against Sky Blue FC, Lloyd scored both of the Flash's game-winning goals: one in the 33rd minute and the second coming during stoppage time. Her two goals resulted in a 2–0 win that advanced <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> to the championship final against the Portland Thorns FC. <b>The</b> <b>Flash</b> were defeated 2–0 during the final.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2010, {{expansion}} team Western New York Flash {{announced that they}} had agreed {{to terms with the}} Canadian striker for the 2011 season. Sinclair helped guide the team to the regular season championship, leading the club with ten goals and eight assists. On August 27, 2011, Sinclair was named MVP of the 2011 WPS Championship Final after <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> won the championship in Rochester, New York. Sinclair's goal in the 64th minute gave <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> a 1–0 lead over Philadelphia. When the game was forced to penalty kicks, Sinclair stepped up and completed the second one as <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> players converted all five of their attempts.|$|E

25|$|Flashed {{headlamps}} {{can have}} ambiguous or contradictory meanings, {{with no way}} for the observing driver to tell for sure what <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> driver is trying to say. It may mean, for example, that <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> driver intends to yield the right of way, or instead {{that he intends to}} take it. Misinterpretation of <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> driver's intent can cause crashes.|$|R
25|$|Building {{evidence}} suggests that the exterior surfaces of the arches were originally fitted with copper <b>flashing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was secured onto the arches and covered by the wood caps. In most locations that were inspected, <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> had been removed, leaving only short remnants at random locations. <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was rolled up and taken away during the 1982 restoration effort. <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was an effective method of preventing moisture from entering the joints in the arch assembly, and its removal hastened deterioration. During this restoration as well, various deteriorated wood elements were replaced with pressure-treated, glue-laminated members.|$|R
5|$|On January 11, 2013, Lloyd {{joined the}} Western New York Flash {{in the new}} National Women's Soccer League {{as part of the}} NWSL Player Allocation. After {{recovering}} from a shoulder injury suffered earlier in the year, Lloyd made her debut for <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> on May 12, 2013 during the team's 2–1 defeat of FC Kansas City. She scored her first goal in a match against her former club, Sky Blue FC, helping <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> win 3–0. During a match against the Washington Spirit on June 28, Lloyd scored a hat trick leading <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> to a 4–0 win. She was subsequently named NWSL Player of the Week for her performance.|$|E
5|$|Over-provisioning (sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning) is the {{difference}} between the physical capacity of <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system (OS) as available for the user. During the garbage collection, wear-leveling, and bad block mapping operations on the SSD, the additional space from over-provisioning helps lower the write amplification when the controller writes to <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> memory.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow {{is now a}} {{standard}} configuration for protected/permissive turn signals in the new US 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, released on December 16, 2009. Only three states are not using <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrows at all. In 2008, Maryland had planned to require that all new signals have flashing yellow arrows; however, their new state MUTCD prohibits <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow in favor of <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> red arrow Maryland has used for years. The other states are Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Hawaii formerly {{did not have a}} flashing yellow arrow; however, its first installation in 2014.|$|R
25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short flashes of light using either a pulsed laser or a xenon flash lamp. When very short <b>flashes</b> are used, <b>the</b> photoinhibitory {{efficiency}} of <b>the</b> <b>flashes</b> depends on <b>the</b> time difference between <b>the</b> <b>flashes.</b> This dependence has been interpreted to indicate that <b>the</b> <b>flashes</b> cause photoinhibition by inducing recombination reactions in PSII, with subsequent production of singlet oxygen. The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon <b>flashes</b> depends on <b>the</b> energy of <b>the</b> <b>flashes</b> even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate {{the formation of the}} substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|R

5|$|On October 16, 2014, the Houston Dash traded Engen, Becky Edwards, and a {{third round}} pick in the 2016 NWSL College Draft in {{exchange}} for Carli Lloyd from the Western New York Flash. Engen missed {{almost half of the}} 2015 NWSL season due to commitments with the United States women's national team at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada. She made three appearances for <b>the</b> <b>Flash</b> before the World Cup then returned to the team on July 19 in a match against Sky Blue FC. She made 12 total appearances for the team in the regular season, playing 1080 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>Flash</b> finished seventh in the league and did not advance to the playoffs.|$|E
40|$|Limulus ventral photoreceptors were voltage clamped to the resting (dark) {{potential}} and stimulated by a 20 -ms test flash and a 1 -s conditioning flash. At a constant level of adaptation, we measured {{the response to}} <b>the</b> test <b>flash</b> given in <b>the</b> dark (control) and the incremental response produced when <b>the</b> test <b>flash</b> occurred within <b>the</b> duration of <b>the</b> conditioning <b>flash.</b> <b>The</b> incremental response {{is defined as the}} response to the conditioning and test <b>flashes</b> minus <b>the</b> response to <b>the</b> conditioning <b>flash</b> given alone. When <b>the</b> test <b>flash</b> was presented within 100 ms after the onset of <b>the</b> conditioning <b>flash</b> we observed that: (a) for dim conditioning <b>flashes</b> <b>the</b> incremental response equaled the control response; (b) for intermediate intensity conditioning <b>flashes</b> <b>the</b> incremental response was greater than the control response (we refer to this as enhancement); (c) for high intensity conditioning <b>flashes</b> <b>the</b> incremental response nearly equaled the control response. Using 10 -μm diam spots of illumnination, we stimulated two spatially separate regions of one photoreceptor. When <b>the</b> test <b>flash</b> and <b>the</b> conditioning <b>flash</b> were presented to the same region, enhancement was present; but when <b>the</b> <b>flashes</b> were applied to separate regions, enhancement was nearly absent. This result indicates that enhancement is localized to the region of illumination. We discuss mechanisms that may account for enhancement...|$|R

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. <b>The</b> <b>flash</b> is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow was {{introduced}} {{not because of}} a perceived {{lack of understanding of}} the circular green. For turning drivers, there is no perceptible difference between <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow and the circular green, because both mean the same thing; however, the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow is different for drivers who are not making the indicated turn. To the driver turning left, <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow means exactly the same as a Yield Sign, and a flashing red arrow means exactly the same as a Stop sign. Left turning drivers facing a flashing yellow arrow are allowed to make a left turn if there is a gap in oncoming traffic, however when facing a flashing red arrow drivers must come to a complete stop before making a left turn. (However, the MUTCD requires that a traffic study be performed before installing a flashing red arrow signal) With <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow or flashing red arrow, opposing straight-ahead traffic has a circular green at the same time. With the steady green arrow, opposing traffic must have a circular red.|$|R

5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E
