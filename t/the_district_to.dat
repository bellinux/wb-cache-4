5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for <b>the</b> <b>District</b> <b>to</b> extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{opened in}} 1892 as an all-male manual {{training}} school. It {{was the second}} public high school in Louisville. Manual merged with its rival, Male High School, into a consolidated school from 1915 to 1919. Manual permanently merged with the Louisville Girls High School in 1950 and moved into their Gothic-style three-story building, built in 1934. In 2004, after conducting a poll, Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper listed Manual as one of Louisville residents' ten favorite buildings. As a coeducational school, Manual experienced a decline in discipline and test scores in the 1970s. In 1984, Manual became a magnet school, allowing students from throughout <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>to</b> apply to five specialized programs of study, or magnets.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>to</b> show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E

5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>to</b> investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. After the election Chelvanayakam met with UNP leader Dudley Senanayake who agreed to Chelvanayakam's conditions for supporting a UNP led government. The agreement, known as the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact (D-C Pact), was put down on paper and signed by Chelvanayakam and Senanayake on 24 March 1965. Under the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which was {{a modified version of the}} B-C pact, Senanayake agreed to make Tamil the language of administration and of record in the Northern and Eastern provinces (Tamil Language Special Provisions Act); amend the Languages of Courts Act to allow legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil; establish District Councils vested with powers over mutually agreed subjects; amend the Land Development Ordinance to provide allotment of land to citizens; and grant land under colonization schemes in the Northern and Eastern provinces to landless people in <b>the</b> <b>district,</b> <b>to</b> Tamil-speaking residents from the two provinces, and to other citizens with preference being given to Tamils from other provinces. Senanayake kept the contents of the D-C Pact a secret which allowed Sinhalese nationalists to allege that he had agreed to the division of the country. Even the leftist Lanka Sama Samaja Party and Communist Party of Ceylon joined the Sinhala nationalist SLFP in propagating this claim.|$|E
