The specific objectives of the biological studies were to evaluate the post-impingement survival of fish, and determine whether installing the screens inside the intake forebay would increase the number of fish impinged relative to the numbers impinged on a screen installed at the intake bay entrance. The results of the survival tests demonstrated that Ristroph-modified screens will substantially reduce the numbers of fish killed by impingement at Indian Point...|$|E

30|$|While {{subjects}} {{should not}} be exposed to radioactivity if their results cannot be used, in our experience, LABs are rare and comprise only 5 % of about 500 subjects screened to date at NIH (unpublished data). Nevertheless, excluding LABs is important when studying radioligands like PBR 28 because brain uptake is so low that it cannot be quantified. Furthermore, excluding LABs requires a genetic test, which often requires an additional visit to the imaging center or sending a blood sample to a laboratory. Depending on several logistical factors, including distance to the imaging center, rarity of the disorder, and ability of the patient to <b>travel,</b> this <b>screening</b> test that requires an additional visit can be quite problematic.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The most {{prevalent}} sedentary behaviours {{in children and}} adolescents are engagement with small screen media (screen-time) and passive travel (by motorised vehicle). The objective of this research was to assess the independence of these behaviours from one another and from physical activity as predictors of cardiorespiratory fitness in youth. Methods: We measured cardiorespiratory fitness in n = 6819 10 - 16. year olds (53 % male) who self-reported their physical activity (7 -day recall) school <b>travel</b> and <b>screen</b> time habits. <b>Travel</b> was classified as active (walking, cycling) or passive; screen time as 4 h. Results: The multivariate odds of being fit were higher in active travel (Boys: OR 1. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 1. 59; Girls: OR 1. 46, 1. 15 - 1. 84) than in passive travel groups. Boys reporting low screen time {{were more likely to be}} fit than those reporting > 4 h (OR 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 68 - 2. 63) as were girls (OR 1. 66, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 2. 20). These odds remained significant after additionally controlling for physical activity. Conclusion: Passive <b>travel</b> and high <b>screen</b> time are independently associated with poor cardiorespiratory fitness in youth, and this relationship is independent of physical activity levels. A lifestyle involving high screen time and habitual passive school travel appears incompatible with healthful levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in youth. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to <b>travel</b> several <b>screens</b> ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once. Once all spare lives are lost, the player character must manually push the bomb.|$|R

The objectives {{of this study}} were (i) To increase the detection rate of imported CHIKV and DENV cases in travellers from endemic areas and promptly identify potential autochthonous cases. (ii) To detect autochthonous cases of WNF, besides those of West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease (WNND) that were already included in a national surveillance. METHODS: Human surveillance: a traveler who had returned within the previous 15 days from endemic countries, with fever > 38 °C, absence of leucocytosis (leukocyte count 38 °C for < 7 days, no recent travel history and absence of other obvious causes of fever. Entomologic surveillance: for West Nile (WNV) it was carried out from May through November placing CDC-CO 2 traps in five provinces of Veneto Region, while for DENV and CHIKV it was also performed around residences of viremic cases.

We obtain the general existence and uniqueness result for the initial value problem by showing a Lipschitz property of the dynamically defined delayed feedback function and give conditions for the nonnegativity of solutions. We determine the steady-state solution of the autonomous system and obtain the linearized equation about the equilibria. Our work was motivated by biological applications where the model setup leads {{to a system of}} differential equations with such dynamically defined delay terms.
