5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> {{throat and}} use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two mandibles, two maxillae, the hypopharynx, and the labrum.|$|E
25|$|Injuries {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> Bullets as {{key players}} Rex Chapman and Calbert Cheaney (the club's first-round draft pick) missed significant stretches, and Ellison missed {{almost the entire}} season.

25|$|The Shar Pei's {{loose skin}} and {{extremely}} prickly coat were originally developed {{to help the}} dogs fend off wild boar, as {{they were used to}} hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually twist in their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would twist in their skin <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> assailant back.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} 1981–1994, Grobbelaar played 627 first team games for Liverpool, {{becoming}} {{known for his}} eccentric and flamboyant style. In 1984, the European Cup final between Liverpool and A.S. Roma finished 1–1 after extra time, {{and went to a}} penalty shootout. As Roma's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani missed and Liverpool {{went on to win the}} shootout 4–2.|$|E
25|$|Male M. drewseni only spend 4.8 days in {{the nest}} after they emerge and {{spend the rest of}} their lives outside of the nest. Once they leave the nest, males tend to {{circulate}} where specific females are because of feeding and foraging opportunities. On their circuits, males seek out nectar from flowers and also seek out mates. Observations have shown that if a male sees a female nearby, he will alter his flight path and pounce on the female to attempt copulation. In most cases, the female is able to shake off the male and fly away. If two males come in contact with the same female, they will usually attack each other and the male that first found the female will try <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> second male.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not know how long a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{hobo spider}} was {{considered}} to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> rabbits. This laboratory study has led to the proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic. The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, the {{government}} began a campaign of repression targeted against the United Irishmen, including executions, routine use of torture, transportation to penal colonies and house burnings. As the repression began <b>to</b> <b>bite,</b> <b>the</b> United Irishmen {{decided to go ahead}} with an insurrection without French help. Their activity culminated in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. When the central core of the plan, an uprising in Dublin, failed, the rebellion then spread in an apparently random fashion firstly around Dublin, then briefly in Kildare, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow. County Wexford in the southeast then saw the most sustained fighting of the rebellion, to be briefly joined by rebels who took to the field in Antrim and Down in the north. A small French force landed in Killala Bay in Mayo leading to a last outbreak of rebellion in counties Mayo, Leitrim and Longford. The rebellion lasted just three months before it was suppressed, but claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. Being the largest outburst of violence in modern Ireland, 1798 looms heavily in collective memory and was commemorated extensively in its centennial and bicentennial anniversaries.|$|E
25|$|Another club from England, Aston Villa, won the {{competition}} in 1982 with a 1–0 win over Bayern Munich at Feijenoord Stadion, Rotterdam. Hamburg then won the final in 1983, beating Juventus 1–0 in a final that, {{for the first time}} in seven years, featured no English side. Liverpool, however, were back in 1984 to defeat Roma in their own stadium, the Stadio Olimpico, in a penalty shoot-out after the teams were tied 1–1, becoming the first team to win the trophy four times since Real Madrid in the 1950s. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. As Roma's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shoot-out 4–2, making Grobbelaar the first African to win a medal in {{the competition}}.|$|E

25|$|When hunting, the wildcat patrols {{forests and}} along forest {{boundaries}} and glades. In favourable conditions, it will readily feed in fields. The wildcat will pursue prey atop trees, even jumping from one branch to another. On the ground, {{it lies in}} wait for prey, then catches it by executing a few leaps, which can span three metres. Sight and hearing are the wildcat's primary senses when hunting, its sense of smell being comparatively weak. When hunting aquatic prey, such as ducks or nutrias, the wildcat waits on trees overhanging the water. It kills small prey by grabbing it in its claws, and piercing the neck or occiput with its fangs. When attacking large prey, the wildcat leaps upon the animal's back, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> neck or carotid. It does not persist in attacking if prey manages to escape it. Wildcats hunting rabbits have been observed to wait above rabbit warrens for their prey to emerge. Although primarily a solitary predator, the wildcat {{has been known to}} hunt in pairs or in family groups, with each cat devoted entirely to listening, stalking, or pouncing. While wildcats in Europe will cache their food, such a behaviour has not been observed in their African counterparts.|$|E

500|$|The islanders also {{supported}} themselves through fishing, exploiting the high-quality catches {{that were to}} be made around the island's coasts. James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness that [...] "The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [...]" [...] As well as trapping lobsters, the islanders practised hand line cod fishing {{in the waters of}} the Firth. This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish <b>to</b> <b>bite,</b> <b>the</b> boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth's unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.|$|E
