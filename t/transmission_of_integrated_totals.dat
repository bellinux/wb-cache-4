40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation of bubble-type vortex breakdown using a unique discrete {{form of the}} full 3 -D, unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations was performed. The Navier-Stokes equations were written in a vorticity-velocity form and the physical problem was not restricted to axisymmetric flow. The problem was parametized on a Rossby- Reynolds-number basis. Utilization of this parameter duo was shown to dictate {{the form of the}} free-field boundary condition specification and allowed control of axial breakdown location within the computational domain. The structure of the breakdown bubble was studied through time evolution plots of planar projected velocity vectors as well as through plots of particle traces and vortex lines. These results compared favorably with previous experimental studies. In addition, profiles of all three velocity components are presented at various axial stations and a Fourier analysis was performed to identify the dominant circumferential modes.

In pressure-driven systems, such components may produce finite amplitude waves and wave attenuation may then be a key design factor in optimizing both devices that operate on steady-state assumptions and devices where unsteadiness is cultivated, for example mixers. A fundamental experimental investigation of wave propagation {{as a function of}} the channel size was performed. A shock wave is transmitted into mm-scale channels to achieve a well-characterized initial condition.

N. furzeri comprises several wild-derived strains with striking differences in longevity ranging from 3 to 9 months, {{which makes it a}} powerful vertebrate model for aging research. The short life cycle of N. furzeri should also facilitate studies on adult traits that are specific to vertebrates. Although progress has been made to generate a genetic linkage map and to start sequencing the genome of N. furzeri, tools to genetically manipulate this species of fish have not yet been developed. Here, we report the first establishment of transgenesis in N. furzeri.

40|$|Centrifugal {{microfluidics}} {{has emerged}} as a unique approach to the development <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>total</b> analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved {{from the center of the}} disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to siphon priming...|$|R
40|$|For lack of {{sufficient}} observations, {{the definition of}} atmospheric moisture fields (including water vapor and clouds) remains a difficult problem whose solution is essential for improved weather forecasts. Moisture fields are under-observed in time and space, primarily due to the high variability {{of water in the}} atmosphere. Because of the important role of water in weather and climate processes, a significant effort has been expended to develop new or improved remote sensing systems to mitigate this problem. One such system uses ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to make accurate all-weather estimates of atmospheric refractivity at very low cost. This largely unanticipated application of GPS has led to a new and potentially significant upper-air observing system for meteorological agencies and researchers around the world (Wolfe and Gutman, 2000). The first and most mature use of GPS for this purpose is in the estimation <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> (<b>total</b> column) precipitable water vapor above a fixed site (Duan et al., 1996, with improvements by Niell, 1996 and Fang et al., 1998). The techniques currently used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Forecast Systems Laboratory (NOAA/FSL) to collect, process, and distribute GPS water vapor observations are mature and almost ready for transition to operational use. NOAA/FSL has shown that GPS integrated water vapor data can be used effectively in objective (i. e. numerical weather prediction) and subjective weather forecasting. T...|$|R
