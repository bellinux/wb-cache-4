When it would get so bad that I did not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
25|$|After playing all 16 games {{during the}} 1998 and 1999 seasons, {{he spent the}} 2000 season out of {{football}} after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, “If I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do this anymore, I wouldn't be here".|$|E
500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm sure people are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have always liked it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E

500|$|When he {{was growing}} up, his father was murdered and both of his {{brothers}} sold drugs. His oldest brother, Timothy, was convicted in 1996 of murder {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison. After the shooting, Munnerlyn's mother converted to Christianity and he eventually did the same. Munnerlyn eventually said of the conversion and his mother's prayers that he would stay out of trouble, [...] "Without her prayers, I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be here in the NFL right now".|$|E
500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after the}} race, Kanaan credited his team's fuel strategy {{for being the}} main factor in his victory. During many of the laps that Wheldon led, Kanaan drafted behind him to use less gasoline than normal, {{and he was able}} to stay on the track longer than other drivers as a result. He said of the strategy, [...] "that's what probably gave me the win." [...] On the other hand, Wheldon later said that his radio problem forced more [...] "conservative" [...] pit stop planning by himself and his team. Third-place finisher Franchitti said: [...] "We had to take the gamble to try to get the win. I thought we had as good a car as TK (Tony Kanaan) and Dan (Wheldon). I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have hung with them, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have caught up with them." [...] Matsuura admitted his first-lap accident was his fault and apologized to his Japanese fans. After his accident on the 135th lap, Andretti was taken to the track's infield care center for a precautionary X-ray scan of his right shoulder which showed a negative result. He said that he struggled with controlling his car but was happy. With his second-place finish, Wheldon gained the season points lead with 188, three ahead of Kanaan and 17 in front of Dixon. The standings were closely contested, with the top six drivers separated by 27 points.|$|E

[...] She also drew on her parents' {{marriage}} for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different.

He believed that his experience, combined with his efforts in Iowa would make up for his lack of funds. Thompson proclaimed to Pajamas Media {{that he would be}} [...] "shocked" [...] if he did not win the straw poll, and in his own personal analysis of the race, commented: [...] "I wouldn't say Romney's in trouble, but I'd say I think it's going to be between Romney and myself."

500|$|At {{the close}} of Grant's two terms as {{president}} in 1877, the Republican-controlled Congress suggested that Grant {{not return to the}} White House for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} here [...] another four years. I do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand it." [...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E

500|$|For the Test {{series against}} Pakistan, Trescothick {{was offered the}} {{captaincy}} once more due to an injury to Vaughan. He was unsure whether to accept but realised that as [...] "unofficial second in command...I believe {{it was the right}} thing to step up. It is exciting to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be in charge for a few weeks...I know there is a chance I maybe won't be a one-match wonder this time – it could be the whole series, but being very close to Michael, I've seen the things it [...] does to you." [...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E
500|$|According to {{journalist}} Barry Miles, after Lennon and Ono {{had been}} injured {{in a car accident}} in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road, a bed was installed in the studio with a microphone so the latter could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during {{the latter part of the}} Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison verbally assaulted her after she took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking. The English press dubbed her [...] "the woman who broke up the Beatles", but Ono has stated that the Beatles broke up themselves without any direct involvement from her, adding [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have tried even to break them up." [...] In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up The Beatles and even Harrison said in an interview with Cavett that the Beatles had problems long before Ono came on the scene.|$|E

I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

[...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it.

500|$|Shortly after Lincoln's assassination, Lowell {{was asked}} to present a poem at Harvard in memory of {{graduates}} killed in the war. His poem, [...] "Commemoration Ode", cost him sleep and his appetite, but was delivered on July 21, 1865, after a 48-hour writing binge. Lowell had high hopes for his performance but was overshadowed by the other notables presenting works that day, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. [...] "I {{did not make the}} hit I expected", he wrote, [...] "and am ashamed at having been tempted again to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write poetry, a delusion from which I have been tolerably free these dozen years." [...] Despite his personal assessment, friends and other poets sent many letters to Lowell congratulating him. Emerson referred to his poem's [...] "high thought & sentiment" [...] and James Freeman Clarke noted its [...] "grandeur of tone". Lowell later expanded it with a strophe to Lincoln.|$|E
500|$|Hunter was the {{offensive}} {{coordinator for the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1981 under head coach Frank Kush. He later served as {{the offensive}} line coach for the NFL's Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts from 1982 to 1984 under Kush. Upon Kush's resignation to become {{head coach of the}} Arizona Wranglers of the United States Football League, Hal became the Colts' interim head coach for the final game of the 1984 season. The Colts lost the game 16–10 to the New England Patriots. He was an offensive line coach working with the guards and centers of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1985 to 1988. Hunter was the offensive line coach of the Cleveland Browns of the NFL in 1989 under coach Bud Carson and was nominated for Offensive Line Coach of the Year. He was then the Browns' special assistant to the head coach in 1990. After the firing of Carson in November 1990, Hunter was hired to be the Browns' offensive line coach by new head coach Bill Belichick on February 20, 1991. Hunter resigned {{at the end of the}} 1992 season, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live through another year with [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
