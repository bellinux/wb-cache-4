2500|$|Support {{for the no}} rate {{strategy}} among leading councillors in Hackney {{was among}} the strongest anywhere. The open declaration by the council of its intentions led one Hackney resident, Mourad Fleming, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> before the council held its budgeting meeting seeking judicial review of the council's actions. In February 1985 Fleming had been the SDP candidate in a byelection in Hackney's Clissold ward which had been won by a Labour candidate pledged to the no rate strategy. On 6 March 1985 in the High Court, Mr Justice Mann issued an interlocutory declaration that the council had a duty to set a rate which did not breach the cap {{and that it could}} not use interim borrowing powers. Notwithstanding the judgment and firm advice from the borough solicitor that the council had to set a rate, on 7 March the council passed a resolution declaring that [...] "the council considers {{it would be impossible to}} make a rate". The resolution disguised the refusal to set a rate as a delay pending negotiation with the Secretary of State.|$|E
2500|$|Degas {{began to}} paint early in life. By {{the time he}} {{graduated}} from the Lycée with a baccalauréat in literature in 1853, at age 18, he had turned a room in his home into an artist's studio. Upon graduating, he registered as a copyist in The Louvre Museum, but his father expected him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school. Degas duly enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in November 1853, but applied little effort to his studies. In 1855 he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom Degas revered and whose advice he never forgot: [...] "Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist." [...] In April of that year Degas was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. He studied drawing there with Louis Lamothe, under whose guidance he flourished, following the style of Ingres. In July 1856, Degas traveled to Italy, where he would remain for the next three years. In 1858, while staying with his aunt's family in Naples, he made the first studies for his early masterpiece The Bellelli Family. He also drew and painted numerous copies of works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and other Renaissance artists, but—contrary to conventional practice—he usually selected from an altarpiece a detail that had caught his attention: a secondary figure, or a head which he treated as a portrait.|$|E

5000|$|J. Carter Walker, son of Captain Walker, and a {{graduate}} of the school, graduated from the University of Virginia in 1897.
