5|$|After {{the final}} whistle, {{there was a}} pitch {{invasion}} by Celtic fans, which meant that the Celtic <b>team</b> <b>could</b> not be presented the trophy on the pitch. Some of the Celtic players also had their shirts taken by Celtic supporters.

The foreman collected wages of 50 cents an hour for roadwork.|$|E
5|$|In late October 2010, the Dutch court {{approved}} {{a request from}} Geert Wilders to have new judges appointed forcing the court to retry the case. On 7 February 2011, Wilders returned to the court room in order that his legal <b>team</b> <b>could</b> present evidence from Islamic experts which the court rejected in 2010, including Mohammed Bouyeri, who murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh, and Dutch academic Hans Jansen.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} expansion drafts, players {{from both the}} American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the expansion clubs. Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being drafted and only one player could be drafted from each team in each round. At {{the end of each}} round, NL <b>teams</b> <b>could</b> protect an additional three players and AL <b>teams</b> <b>could</b> protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL <b>teams</b> <b>could</b> have three players chosen.|$|R

5|$|Though the Andorran Football Federation {{formed in}} 1994, and the {{domestic}} league started in 1995, the national <b>team</b> <b>could</b> {{not participate in}} major championships until it gained affiliation with governing bodies FIFA and UEFA in 1996. The national team played its first match against Estonia in Andorra La Vella and lost 6–1.|$|E
5|$|After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona {{signed the}} English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the <b>team</b> <b>could</b> not achieve success, as Schuster was {{excluded}} from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired {{at the beginning of}} the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.|$|E
5|$|At Euro 2000, Lokvenc made a {{substitute}} {{appearance in the}} Czech Republic's opening game against the Netherlands, replacing Pavel Nedvěd after 89 minutes as the match resulted in a 1–0 win for the Dutch. He replaced Radek Bejbl in the second group match, against France, coming on after 49 minutes in the 2–1 loss. Lokvenc appeared in the third group match against Denmark, although due to both teams having lost both of their previous matches, neither <b>team</b> <b>could</b> advance to {{the next round of}} the competition. He came on after 79 minutes, replacing Vladimír Šmicer in a 2–0 win for his nation.|$|E

The existing <b>teams</b> <b>could</b> lose only {{a maximum of}} three players, including a maximum of one goaltender. The Seals, Canadiens, Flyers and Blues could exempt themselves from losing a goaltender because they had each lost a goalie in the 1970 Expansion Draft; however, the Canadiens and Blues chose to expose a goalie.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration <b>team</b> <b>could</b> not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{struggles with}} injury, Portland {{performed}} at a playoff level throughout the season. LaMarcus Aldridge {{emerged as the}} focal point of the team and posted career-high numbers, as well as Western Conference Player of the Week and Month honors. Wesley Matthews also emerged in the absence of Brandon Roy, proving his worth as the Blazers' key off-season addition. Believing the <b>team</b> <b>could</b> make a significant run in the playoffs, Cho executed his first major trade on February 24, 2011, just seven minutes before the deadline. The Trail Blazers sent forward Dante Cunningham, center Joel Przybilla and center Sean Marks to the Charlotte Bobcats in return for former All-Star and All-Defensive forward Gerald Wallace.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{injuries}} claimed enough Maryland Agricultural {{football players}} that the <b>team</b> <b>could</b> no longer field a practice squad to scrimmage against. The college turned to Byrd, who was serving as coach at Western High School in Georgetown, {{and he was}} willing to help his alma mater with scrimmages. Byrd later replaced head coach Charley Donnelly, who resigned mid-season after accumulating a 2–4–2 record. Byrd led the Aggies to wins in both of their final games of the season, against Western Maryland, 6–0, and Gallaudet, 6–2.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous year, 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford. The university side failed to win a single match, and despite favourable batting conditions, none of the batsmen scored a century. Palairet was second in the batting averages, scoring 276 runs at 21.23. Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet's captaincy, particularly for the University match, in which he believed a stronger <b>team</b> <b>could</b> have been chosen. Cambridge had a powerful team, containing eight of their players from the previous year, and adding Arthur Jones and K. S. Ranjitsinhji. Oxford lost the match by 266 runs, with only Palairet and Fry scoring more than 12 runs for the side.|$|E
5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship. Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play (due to the refugee problem), they decided to participate so the <b>team</b> <b>could</b> remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. Since there was no permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a <b>team</b> <b>could</b> forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E

On June 12 he caught Justin Verlander's first no-hitter, the second no-hitter he caught in his career. In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 percent of his plate appearances, the lowest {{percentage}} in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, 13-million-dollar option on Rodríguez's contract, keeping him on the Tigers team through at least the 2008 season. The <b>team</b> <b>could</b> have bought out the option for three million dollars and allowed him to become a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the <b>team</b> <b>could</b> {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|The Orlando Magic first {{participated in}} the National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft on June 27, 1989, about five months before their inaugural NBA season. The NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds from 1989 onward. Before each draft, an NBA draft lottery determines the first round {{selection}} order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, so some years a <b>team</b> <b>could</b> have more than or less than two picks.|$|E

5|$|The Special Air Service (SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. The regiment was formed by Colonel David Stirling in Africa in 1941, {{at the height of the}} Second World War. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams, usually of just four men, to carry out raids, having realised that a four-man <b>team</b> <b>could</b> sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The driver's {{clothing}} was color-coded {{in accordance with}} his faction, which would help distant spectators {{to keep track of}} the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each <b>team</b> <b>could</b> have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.|$|E

Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, {{she wanted to get}} as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security <b>team</b> <b>could</b> not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E
