5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E

The {{aftermath}} of the Fourth Corporate War has resulted in widespread corruption of the Net and major losses of hardcopied data, to the point that all data is intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt. An example that pops up in Pondsmith's demos at conventions, releases on the Internet, and in the finished game is that history has become so corrupted <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world now believe Richard Nixon, instead of resigning over Watergate, committed suicide on camera and that memes such as the moon landing being hoaxed become prevalent.|$|E

500|$|The cost of {{the tickets}} was too high for many fans in South America, so the band {{broadcast}} the 11 February concert in Chile live on television. Knowing <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> {{the country would be}} watching, they played [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] in place of [...] "Wake Up Dead Man". The stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet's regime following the coup d'état. Again it was performed solely by Bono and the Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them onstage a second time. The Madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance, an act which received a mixed reception from the audience. Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to [...] "tell these women where are the bones of their children." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Russian website {{entitled}} A New Chronicle of Current Events {{appeared on}} the Internet in 2015. One of its founders, former Soviet dissident Victor Davydoff, {{in an interview with}} the [...] "Voice of America" [...] radio station, referred to the past experience of dissidents in the USSR. Any attempts at change within the system were immediately suppressed in Russia. When dissidents appealed to international human rights organizations and foreign governments, however, there was a result. The same approach, he suggested, should be used now. Mass manipulation through the media meant <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Russia did not understand what was happening, either in their own country or abroad.

2500|$|Draco {{serves as}} a foil to the hero, Harry Potter and is loosely based on bullies Rowling {{encountered}} during her school days. Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's. (The character of the school bully is a recurring character in the School story genre, going back to Flashman in Tom Brown's School Days.) Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet Mudbloods, should be denied a magical education. Harry's first impression that the Wizarding community is a [...] "magical wonderland" [...] is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, [...] " [...] found out <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty {{as they are in}} our world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Charlotte Three {{case was}} {{an event that}} epitomized the larger issues of politics, race, {{and the civil rights}} {{movement}} in the South. The commuting of the sentences for the men may not have actually been purely due to the reasons publicly stated, but instead for hidden political ones. In 1979, an election year, {{there was a lot of}} turmoil and Governor Hunt and the Democratic party were worried about the backlash that would ensue if the men were still imprisoned at the time of the election. Herbert N. Lape who was serving as the vice-chairman of the North Carolina state democratic party stated in a letter to Hunt <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the state view [...] "the Charlotte Three [...] as [...] primarily white witch [...] that involved racial bigotry". A secretary by the name of Joseph Grimsley also stated in a memo to Governor Hunt, [...] " [...] state's repressive image is beginning to spill over in this administration to yours personally".|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{administrative}} officer in Changshan recommended Zhao Yun {{to serve in the}} government. Zhao Yun then led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province who was nominally a General of the Household (中郎將) under the Han central government. Around the time, another warlord Yuan Shao was recently appointed as the Governor (牧) of Ji Province and his fame was steadily rising, so Gongsun Zan was worried <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> You Province would choose to serve under Yuan instead of him. When Zhao Yun came to join him, he mocked Zhao, [...] "I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. Why did you have a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?" [...] Zhao Yun replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and it's unclear who is right and who is wrong. The people are in danger. Those in my home province, after careful deliberation, decided to follow a lord who practises benevolent governance. Therefore, I chose to join you, General, instead of Lord Yuan." [...] He participated in some of Gongsun Zan's battles against rival forces.|$|E
50|$|At <b>that</b> time, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Britain opposed income tax, on principle, {{because the}} {{disclosure}} of personal income represented an unacceptable governmental intrusion into private matters, and a potential threat to personal liberty.

2500|$|The {{number of}} members of the Eastern Orthodox Church in each country has been subject to a lot of debate. Each study {{performed}} that seeks to discover the number of adherents in a country may use different criteria, and be submitted to different populations. As such, some numbers may be inflated, and therefore inaccurate. Examples of this are Greece and Russia, where estimates of adherence to Eastern Orthodoxy may reach 80-98%, but where surveys found lower percentages professing Eastern Orthodoxy or belief in God. The likely reason for this disparity is <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> these majority Eastern Orthodox countries will culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially if they were baptized as children, even if they are not currently practicing. This includes those who may be irreligious, yet culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, or for whom Eastern Orthodox Christianity is listed on official state records. Other cases of incongruent data also might be due to counting ethnic groups from Eastern Orthodox countries rather than actual adherents. A case of this is the United States, which has large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Orthodox countries. The Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions often reported large numbers of members, which together would total 2-3 million across the country. However, a 2010 study by Alexei Krindatch sought data from each parish, with the specific criteria of annual participation. This study produced the [...] "Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches", and discovered that there were only about 817,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians actively practicing their faith (that is to say, attending church services on a regular basis) in the United States. The study explained that such a difference was due to a variety of circumstances, for example the higher numbers having counted all people who self-identify as Eastern Orthodox on a census regardless of active participation, or all people belonging to ethnic groups originating in Eastern Orthodox countries. This study, while initially controversial, proved groundbreaking, and has since been officially approved for use by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{attacks in}} areas outside Australia are {{believed}} to go unreported, with one study positing up to 20 to 30 attacks occur every year. This number may be conservative in light of several areas where humans and saltwater crocodiles co-exist in relatively undeveloped, low-economy and rural regions, where attacks are likely to go unreported. However, claims {{in the past that}} saltwater crocodiles are responsible for thousands of human fatalities annually are likely to have been exaggerations and were probably falsified to benefit leather companies, hunting organizations and other sources which may have benefited from maximizing the negative perception of crocodiles for financial gain. Although it does not pay to underestimate such a formidable predator, one that has no reason to not view humans as prey, many wild saltwater crocodiles are normally quite wary of humans and will {{go out of their way}} to submerge and swim away from them, even large adult males, if previously subject to harassment or persecution. Some attacks on humans appear to be territorial rather than predatory in nature, with crocodiles over two years in age often attacking anything that comes into their area (including boats). Humans can usually escape alive from such encounters, which comprise about half of all attacks. Non-fatal attacks usually involve crocodiles of [...] or less in length. Fatal attacks, more likely to be predatory in motivation, commonly involve larger crocodiles with an average estimated size of [...] Under normal circumstances, Nile crocodiles {{are believed to}} be responsible for a considerably greater number of fatal attacks on humans than saltwater crocodiles, but this may have more to do with the fact <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Africa tend to rely on riparian areas for their livelihood, which is less prevalent in most of Asia and certainly less so in Australia. In the Andaman Islands, the number of fatal attacks on humans has reportedly increased, the reason inferred due to habitat destruction and reduction of natural prey.|$|E
