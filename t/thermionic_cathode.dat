5000|$|He {{invented the}} dynatron vacuum tube which had three electrodes: a <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode,</b> a {{perforated}} anode, and a supplementary anode or plate. In normal operation the supplementary anode was maintained {{at a lower}} positive voltage than the perforated anode. The secondary emission of electrons from the plate made the dynatron behave as a true negative resistance and so the tube could generate oscillations {{over a wide range}} of frequencies or be used as an amplifier. When a control grid was added between the cathode and the perforated anode, the device was called a [...] "pliodynatron." ...|$|E
50|$|A tetrode is {{a vacuum}} tube (called valve in British English) having four active {{electrodes}}. The four electrodes in {{order from the}} centre are: a <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode,</b> first and second grids and a plate (called anode in British English). There are several varieties of tetrodes, the most common being the screen-grid tube and the beam tetrode. In screen-grid tubes and beam tetrodes, the first grid is the control grid and the second grid is the screen grid. In other tetrodes one of the grids is a control grid, while the other may {{have a variety of}} functions.|$|E
50|$|In vacuum tubes, a {{hot cathode}} or <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode</b> is a cathode {{electrode}} which is heated {{to make it}} emit electrons due to thermionic emission. This {{is in contrast to}} a cold cathode which does not have a heating element. The heating element is usually an electrical filament, heated by a separate electric current passing through it. Hot cathodes typically achieve much higher power density than cold cathodes, emitting significantly more electrons from the same surface area. Cold cathodes rely on field electron emission or secondary electron emission from positive ion bombardment and do not require heating. There are two types of hot cathode. In a directly heated cathode, the filament is the cathode and emits the electrons. In an indirectly heated cathode, the filament or heater heats a separate metal cathode electrode which emits the electrons.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s, Hull {{also was}} a major {{contributor}} to the development of gas-filled electron tubes at the GERL.

40|$|RF guns have {{recently}} been very commonly used in high-energy research accelerators, {{as well as in}} various applications of accelerators such as FEL, because it offers significant advantages over the conventional techniques, which use electron guns and bunchers. In this paper, the novel structure of the RF gun, utilizing the pi/ 2 mode, standing wave, on-axis coupled structure (OCS), is described. The new structure offers much higher group velocity and lower emittance over the structure that is commonly used. As a result, the new structure has a more stable operation for higher beam current without sacrificing beam emittance. Moreover, the structure offers unique characteristics in reduction of back bombardment for the application of <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathodes</b> in RF guns. The cavity structure and beam parameters were optimized by using EMSYS (2 D) and MAFIA (3 D). An overview of design detail and prototype structure, which can be used with either <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathodes</b> or photocathodes, will be presented. ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{it is more}} {{difficult}} for the opposite (negative) end of the tether to eject free electrons or to collect positive ions from the plasma. It is plausible that, by using a very large collection area {{at one end of the}} tether, enough ions can be collected to permit significant current through the plasma. This was demonstrated during the Shuttle orbiter's TSS-1R mission, when the shuttle itself was used as a large plasma contactor to provide over an ampere of current. Improved methods include creating an electron emitter, such as a <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode,</b> plasma cathode, plasma contactor, or field electron emission device. Since both ends of the tether are [...] "open" [...] to the surrounding plasma, electrons can flow out of one end of the tether while a corresponding flow of electrons enters the other end. In this fashion, the voltage that is electromagnetically induced within the tether can cause current to flow through the surrounding space environment, completing an electrical circuit through what appears to be, at first glance, an open circuit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{space charge}} grid tube {{was the first}} type of tetrode to appear. In {{the course of his}} {{research}} into the action of the [...] "audion" [...] triode tube of Lee de Forest, Irving Langmuir found that the action of the heated <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode</b> was to create a space charge, or cloud of electrons, around the cathode. This cloud acted as a virtual cathode. With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the space charge returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the electric field due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it. However, if a grid bearing a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode. This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge. Firstly, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage. Secondly the transconductance (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly important since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.|$|E
5000|$|Klystrons amplify RF {{signals by}} {{converting}} the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. A {{beam of electrons}} is produced by a <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathode</b> (a heated pellet of low work function material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically {{in the tens of}} kilovolts). This beam is then passed through an input cavity resonator. RF energy is fed into the input cavity at, or near, its resonant frequency, creating standing waves, which produce an oscillating voltage which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to [...] "bunch": electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated, causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency. To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional [...] "buncher" [...] cavities. The beam then passes through a [...] "drift" [...] tube in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the [...] "bunches", then through a [...] "catcher" [...] cavity. In the output [...] "catcher" [...] cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them. Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a coaxial cable or waveguide. The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.|$|E

However, the performance and lifetime demonstrated so far with gaseous propellants are at best marginal for these missions. <b>Thermionic</b> <b>cathodes</b> have been long identified as the run-time limiting components in both steady-state and pulsed devices making them a priority {{in the development of}} future high power MPD thrusters. In this dissertation, an experimental and theoretical investigation of high-current hollow cathodes performance is carried out to provide guidelines for scaling and increasing MPDT lifetime. It is found that, whether the cathode technology, quasi-steady application results in erosion rates not compatible with any real mission duration. As a consequence, a theoretical model is derived for the performance evaluation of steady-state <b>thermionic</b> <b>cathodes</b> and verified by comparison with experimental data available in the literature. The model includes the effect of non-equilibrium multi-step ionization and allows for estimation of the plasma penetration length. It is shown that the cathode operative temperature can be effectively reduced by using low-work function refractory ceramics or by seeding the gaseous propellant with alkali metal vapours. However, since the seed neutral number densities required for an effective covering of the surface are in the order of the propellant density or higher, an emitting layer can be maintained only at very high seed mass flow rates. It is thus concluded that the use of non-diffusing low-work function insert is preferred.
