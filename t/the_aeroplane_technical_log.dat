50|$|Shortly before, on 26 October, he {{was posted}} to <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Experimental Unit (later <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> and Armament Experimental Establishment) at Martlesham Heath, serving {{there as a}} test pilot {{until the end of}} the war.|$|R
50|$|Bickerton's final {{injuries}} of the {{war were}} suffered in May 1918, when he was serving as a test pilot at <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Experimental Station at Martlesham Heath in Suffolk. On 18 May, he was testing bomb-aiming equipment in a Vicker's Vimy bomber. When <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> suffered simultaneous failure in both its engines, forcing Bickerton to attempt a crash-landing. The resulting smash destroyed <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> and left Bickerton with concussion and broken fingers.|$|R
5|$|Bertie <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> was {{introduced}} as Aeroplane Jelly's mascot in 1942. Named after Bert Appleroth, Bertie sung the jingle in cinema advertising.

50|$|Martlesham Heath {{was first}} used as a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} during World War I. In 1917 it became home to <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Experimental Unit, RFC which moved from Upavon with the site named as <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Experimental Station which became <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) in 1924. The A&AEE carried the evaluation and testing {{of many of the}} aircraft types and much of the armament and other equipment that would later be used during World War II.|$|R

50|$|The game {{begins with}} Brian chatting with Sushi Douglas, who needs help {{and tells him}} what happened. A couple of days before, Brian and Gina go on {{vacation}} to the Mala Island. From the first moment Brian distrust no only of <b>the</b> company of <b>aeroplane,</b> if no also of <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> and of <b>the</b> old pilot. After the presumptive death of Otto, the pilot, the protagonists have to jump of <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> where only there is an only parachute. Gina, forced to jump with the parachute, is shot with tranquilizers and falls slept in a lake. Brian runs a similar luck when <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> with him, crashes {{in the middle of}} the jungle.|$|R

5000|$|On 22 April 2016, the BEA finally {{concluded}} {{the cause of}} the crash as follows: [...] "The aeroplane speed, piloted by the autothrottle, decreased due to the obstruction of the pressure sensors located on the engine nose cones, probably caused by ice crystals. The autopilot then gradually increased the angle of attack to maintain altitude until <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> stalled. <b>The</b> stall was not recovered. <b>The</b> <b>aeroplane</b> retained a pitch-down attitude and left bank angle down to the ground, while the control surfaces remained mainly deflected pitch up and {{in the direction of a}} bank to <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>aeroplane</b> hit <b>the</b> ground at high speed." ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{parameter}} {{spaces of}} rational maps {{is an active}} area of complex dynamics. There is a region of a particular parameter space of rational maps which contains all possible matings with the rabbit polynomial in a well understood manner. In an effort to further understand which hyperbolic components of the parameter space correspond to matings with <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> we relate <b>the</b> family of matings with <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> to <b>the</b> family of matings with the rabbit. We present an algorithm, described in chapter 3, which calculates the mating with the rabbit which is Thurston equivalent to a given post-critically finite mating with <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane.</b> Chapter 4 gives a result describing which matings with the rabbit are Thurston equivalent to some mating with <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane.</b> Chapter 5 studies the algorithm in more detail, giving results bounding the number of steps required for the algorithm to produce a result.

50|$|So {{long as the}} power-to-weight {{ratios of}} {{aircraft}} engines remained low and specific fuel consumption high, the airship had an edge for long-range or -duration operations. As those figures changed, the balance shifted rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane's</b> favour. By mid-1917, the airship could no longer survive in a combat situation where <b>the</b> threat was <b>aeroplanes.</b> By <b>the</b> late 1930s, the airship barely had an advantage over <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> on intercontinental over-water flights, and that advantage had vanished {{by the end of}} World War II.|$|R

50|$|An {{up slope}} runway will allow an {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} a shorter distance. A down slope runway will require a greater landing distance. It will take longer for <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> to touch down from 50 ft above the runway threshold, as the runway is falling away beneath <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> and of course braking while going downhill is not as effective as on a level or up slope runway.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 January 1999 a F-27 (registration: G-CHNL) {{operating}} a cargo flight for Channel Express arriving from Luton crashed short of runway 27 after deploying full flap on approach. As the flap deployed, the cargo moved aft and exited <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane's</b> {{mass and balance}} limits, the flight crew initiated a go-around which further exacerbated problem by raising the gear and applying power. <b>The</b> <b>aeroplane</b> pitched up uncontrollably and stalled {{which resulted in the}} aircraft impacting the conservatory of a house located under the flight path. Fortunately no one on the ground was injured, however both flight crew were killed by the resulting fire which engulfed the aircraft. The investigation concluded <b>the</b> <b>aeroplane</b> was not loaded in accordance with the loadsheet.|$|R
