We conduct experimental auctions on products with a subset of attributes (part) and a comprehensive set of attributes (whole) related to animal welfare. Results show that elicited willingness to pay estimates do not pass the scope test, and these are robust to the experimental auction approach used. Implications of these findings are discussed.

40|$|Desires {{are usually}} {{presented}} as simple states whose contribution to action, choice, and deliberation are understood simply {{in terms of}} motivational strength and object. The challenge of temptation is {{to give an account}} of desires that explains why temptations should not be treated on a par with other desires in rational deliberation. Desires qua simple states fail this challenge as ex hypothesi {{what it is to be}} tempted to do some thing is for doing that thing to be your strongest motivation. I examine the nature of desire through the lens of temptation, and create a more complex picture of desires identifying and defending various properties of desires. These properties are: an account of how desires may be more or less stable with respect to reflection and new information; the emotional component of desires (desire responses), in variously forming and undermining our reflectively stable desires (considered preferences); how it is that we are psychologically disposed <b>to</b> <b>value</b> <b>goods</b> over time (hyperbolically), and the way in which it is rational <b>to</b> <b>value</b> <b>goods</b> over time (exponentially); finally an account of the difference between warranted and unwarranted changes in the strength of desires. Temptation is a consequence of a pervasive natural tendency to discount the future hyperbolically. If you discount the future hyperbolically, then the proximity of the good causes the comparative strength of your desire responses to reverse. Desire responses are produced by a perception-like system within the agent, the conative system. This reversal occurs because proximity constitutes abnormal operating conditions for the conative system, thus producing unreliable desire responses. As the visual system produces misleading visual perceptions under abnormal conditions, the conative system can produce misleading desire responses under abnormal conditions—temptations. We can identify and compensate for these misleading desire responses by paying attention to the relative stability of our desires. Thus desires are not simple states which contribute to deliberation solely in terms of object and strength, but rather more complex states that contribute to deliberation in terms of their stability and emotional components, as well as their object and motivational strength...|$|E

This paper provides just such a valuation, using economic impact analysis conducted on surveys of visitor and organiser spending at the 2009 Cape Town International Jazz Festival. On the basis of the survey data and event budget, a social accounting matrix (SAM) for the Western Cape Province was used to estimate the economic value of the festival to the province's economy (using the classic SAM's multiplier approach). The results of the analysis show that the festival generates approximately R 158 million via visitor and organiser spending, and that 1059 jobs depend on it. events, economic impact, computable general equilibrium models, music festival, jazz festival, South Africa,...|$|E
40|$|A key {{institutional}} {{setting is}} {{the set of}} rules balancing the use of coercion to the one of markets for transferring property rights. Even if all legal systems forbid theft ex ante, different societies provide different ex post solutions to the conflict arising between the original owner and the good-faith buyer of a good with defective title. These rules range from the full protection of the original owner’s property right to the full protection of the buyer’s reliance on contract. Looking at {{a world in which}} only intermediaries can transfer goods from original owners to buyers by using either coercion or markets, we prove that: 1. Society should accept coercion, if buyers value the good more than original owners, and minimize it, otherwise; 2. In the first of the two cases, provided that the preference polarization is not too wide, there are separating equilibria in which moral intermediaries—i. e., those for whom coercion entails a sufficiently high moral cost—signal their proper title by charging higher prices; 3. In the second of the two cases, the market shrinks because moral intermediaries refrain from coercion. Thus, mature economies—i. e., those in which original owners tend <b>to</b> <b>value</b> <b>goods</b> more than buyers—will move toward buyer protection, the higher is the share of moral intermediaries (lower is the quality of the legal system) because of the lower extent of coercion (lower impact of public enforcement). Estimates, based on a panel of 148 countries over the 1981 - 2011 period, are consistent with this prediction...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays about consumer judgment and decision making. In Essay 1, I develop a novel explanation for the well-known endowment effect - the tendency for owners <b>to</b> <b>value</b> <b>goods</b> more than non-owners do. According to a prominent explanation for this effect, the prospect of losing possessions creates psychological pain, inducing sellers to demand more than buyers will pay. My alternative account is based on transaction disutility: consumers are reluctant to trade on terms that are disadvantageous with respect to perceived market prices. The endowment effect appears {{to be caused by}} inflated selling prices because market prices usually exceed the value of ownership to consumers. But I show that reducing reference prices relieves sellers' transaction disutility, shrinking or eliminating the effect. Moreover, very low reference prices create disutility among buyers, resulting in disparities driven by a reluctance to buy, not to sell. Essay 2 explores the implications of transaction disutility for consumer preferences. Maximum buying and minimum selling prices are commonly believed to reveal preferences: a consumer who prefers one good over another presumably has a higher reservation price for it. But transaction disutility can distort reservation prices away from underlying values. If alternative measures of preference - such as binary choices between goods - are not regarded by consumers as transactions, they are not subject to such distortions. This difference can create preference reversals, that is, incoherence between explicit choices and the preferences implied by stated reservation prices. I find strong experimental evidence for this proposition. The "Bayesian Truth Serum" (BTS) is a survey scoring method designed to provide truth telling incentives for respondents answering multiple choice questions about intrinsically private matters: opinions, tastes, past behavior. (cont.) My final essay discusses several tests of BTS. In one questionnaire, respondents indicated their familiarity with various items (e. g. electronics brands), one-third of which were nonexistent foils. BTS did in fact reward truth telling: the scoring method severely penalized "recognition" of foils. Also, survey takers viewed the BTS method as credible: people who were paid for achieving higher BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils, even when facing competing incentives to deceive. by Ray Weaver.

By an in-depth analysis {{of the role of}} government in East Asian’s development it provides recommendations for Ethiopia. The study is based on the experiences of South Korea, Taiwan and Japan in the context of three issues: selective intervention policies, coordination problem and export orientation. Results of the study show that governments in East Asia have used phased selective intervention mechanism to nurture their industries and coordinated private investment to ensure national development. They have also targeted export markets to make their firms competitive and upgrade exports from primary products <b>to</b> higher <b>value</b> <b>goods.</b> The selective intervention suggests a greater role for government, however targeting of exports and the efficiency from international competition indicates the virtue of market mechanisms as well. Government intervention however must be phased, moving from targeting primary products <b>to</b> higher <b>value</b> <b>goods.</b> This paper suggests that government intervention has to be supplemented by a government-firm relationship that avoids too much government autonomy, which is meant to solve rent-seeking problem.
