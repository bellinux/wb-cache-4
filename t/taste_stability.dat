40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Mechanical tooth {{cleaning}} {{is arguably}} the most common plaque control procedure. However, due to complex bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases and caries and unreliability of mechanical plaque control procedures chemical agents to control microbial agents have attracted a lot of attention as useful adjunctive methods. The aim {{of the present study was}} to review the effect of mouthwashes and chewing gums on orodental health. Materials and Methods: In this review the protective role of mouthwashes and chewing gums in dental and oral health was evaluated by a comprehensive search in electronic databases such as ISI and Pubmed and a hand search of relevant journals and books from 1980 until 2011. Results: Mouthwashes are known as the simplest system for the delivery of antiplaque and antimicrobial agents. Mouthwashes, similar to toothpastes, should have some characteristics, including the potential to remove enamel and dentin microbial plaques, cleaning properties, good <b>taste,</b> chemical <b>stability</b> and low cost. Common claims for the effects of chewing gums in regular users of xylitol-containing gums include removal of food debris and plaque from tooth surfaces, stimulation of salivary flow, increasing the pH of saliva and plaque, decreasing caries rate, and decreasing the incidence of gingivitis and periodontitis. The use of chewing gums to deliver fluoride and bicarbonate, and minerals such as calcium and phosphate into the oral cavity enhances acid-buffering capacity and decreases demineralization rate. Conclusion: Use of mouthwashes and sugar-free chewing gums, especially xylitol-containing chewing gums, alone or in combination with other dental-protective substances with optimal doses and time periods can be considered effective programs for high-risk populations to achieve oral health.

40|$|World apple {{production}} {{accounted for}} 80 million {{tons per year}} (1. 7 and 3. 1 Mts in France and Poland, respectively). Most of this production corresponds to dessert apples. However, in France, ciders (fermented apple juices) are famous beverages produced from specific apple varieties classified according to two main criteria: polyphenol concentration and acidity of the crude juice (i. e. the must). Indeed, polyphenols are divided into six main classes: phenolic acids, catechins, procyanidins (i. e. condensed tanins), dihydrochalcones, flavonols and anthocyanins. Depending on the considered classes, polyphenols more or less contribute to organoleptic qualities of ciders including colour, bitter and astringent <b>tastes,</b> colloidal <b>stability</b> (clearness/cloudiness) and also indirectly to some particular aromas. Now they are also well-known for their contribution to preserve human health through their presence in food. In this conference, I will present a review of our works {{in the field of}} varietal diversity, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and physico-chemistry of apple polyphenols in raw materials (fruits) and in processed products (musts, juices and ciders) with regard to their contribution to organoleptic properties.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado en el EuroFoodChem XVII celebrado en Istambul (Turkey) del 7 al 10 de mayo de 2013. Acrylamide and {{hydroxymethylfurfural}} (HMF) {{are both}} potential human carcinogens {{that occur in}} food {{as a result of}} cooking or heat processing. Both compounds are considered as important food contaminants within the last several years, and research is ongoing in the areas of toxicology, exposure, formation, and mitigation. The formation of acrylamide and HMF is part of the Maillard reaction, which leads to browning and flavor changes in cooked foods. The proposedtechniques to mitigate acrylamide are as follows: reducing the availability of free asparagine or reducing sugars, modifying other ingredients, and changing cooking time or temperature. Different techniques appear to be useful for different types of products. For cereal products, modifying the time or temperature of cooking, avoiding use of ammonium bicarbonate, and using materials low in asparagine may be more relevant. Most of them are also useful for reducing HMF formation because both chemicals are formed by the same chemical event. Importantly, most proposed measures for reducing acrylamide are still commercially unproven. For the approval of food processing contaminants’ mitigating techniques is necessary to know whether these measures affect the <b>taste,</b> <b>stability</b> and safety of a product. The present researcher aimed to mitigate acrylamide and HMF formation by reducing or substituting the added sugar using maltitol or stevioside. The effect of the formulation on sensory properties of cookies was also investigated. Four biscuit formulations were prepared based on wheat flour and using as sugar sucrose, mixed sucrose and stevia, maltitol or stevia. HMF determination was based on the method of Rufián-Henares et al., 2006 while acrylamide was determined by HPLC-MS according to Arribas-Lorenzo and Morales (2009). Color measurements were performed on the ground and homogenized samples using a Hunter Lab D 25 - 9 optical sensor (Hunter Associated Laboratory, Reston, Virginia, USA) according to the CIE Lab scale. A sensorial panel tested the acceptance of the newly formulated foods. Replacing reducing saccharides by saccharide alcohols such as maltitol and stevia significantly reduce the formation of food processing contaminants during baking. Substituting sugars altered some of the cookie quality attributes such as color development however it was not reflected on acceptance for the panelists.

40|$|The {{storage of}} beer in plastic bottles is problematical {{because of the}} bad barrier quality of {{plastics}} against oxygen or carbon dioxide. The author looks for possibilities to store up beer in plastic bottles {{with respect to a}} high imperishability. The permeation quality of different plastic bottles with respect to oxygen and carbon dioxide is investigated using different plastic materials such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene naphthalate) or composits of both with ethylene vinyl alcohol or polyamide. Furthermore, different closures such as crown cork closure, a single plastic screw cap or a plastic screw cap with a sealing. The permeation of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the plastic bottle is investigated by different methods. Oxygen content is measured electrolytically and by means of the determination of sulfur dioxide content. The loss of carbon dioxide in the bottled beer is measured using the method of Blom/Lund. The entrance of oxygen into the plastics bottle depends on the medium inside the bottle. The permeation of oxygen is reduced {{in the case of a}} gas mixture. After a certain storage duration, a certain equilibrium concentration of oxygen in the beer is existent. The value of this equilibrium concentration depends on gas permeability of the plastics bottles and the rate of reaction of oxygen with the beer components. The oxygen concentration existing ultimatively after the bottling only influences the time duration according to the development of the equilibrium concentration. There is a mutual superimposition of different influences of the aging of beer such as temperature, entrance of oxygen and time. The aging of beer only on the basis of oxygen entrance can be studied. The titrimetrical measurement of the loss of carbon dioxide during the storage is the best measuring technique. Due to the limited passage of gas, different closures positively influence the imperishability of beer. In order to realize migration experiments, clear bottles of the type PENg (poly(ethylene naphthalate) and Pils from Weihenstephaner Staatsbrauerei (Weihenstephan, Germany)) as a beer are used. Due to the migration of the aging components into the wall of the plastic bottle, the <b>taste</b> <b>stability</b> of the beer does not alter after a new filling of the bottle with beer. The endangering of the stability of the bottles can be minimized by suitable chemicals such as chain lubricants and cleaning agents. The stability of the plastic bottles can be minimized by suitable chemicals such as chain lubricants and cleaning agents. The stability of the plastic bottles depends on its material and procedure. Sulfuric dioxide is suitable to improve the imperishability of the beer while ferulic acid and (+) -catechol as antioxidizer make the beer clouder. The imperishability of beer in gastight multilayer plastic bottles with scavenger closures is comparable to that in glass bottles.

40|$|AbstractMilk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are typical examples of high pressure homogenized commodities. High pressure homogenization is therefore a well established process and realized at around 10 Mio tons {{per year in the}} dairy industry. Milk {{and dairy products}} are homogenized to improve product properties such as color, consistency, <b>taste,</b> creaming <b>stability,</b> creaminess and mouthfeel [1]. The basic idea of high pressure homogenization is to pressurize an emulsion premix up to several hundred bars and then pump it through a disruption system (full stream homogenisation). State of the art as disruption systems are flat valves. Besides conventional flat valves a simple or complex orifice type of valves like the interaction chamber of Microfluidics® may also serve as disruption system [2]. Within the talk, different disruption systems will be compared with regard to disruption effectiveness and power efficiency. As high pressure is required for droplet disruption into the submicron range high investment, energy and maintenance costs result from high pressure homogenization processes. The product active ingredients are subjected to intense mechanical and thermal stresses. Problems in term of costs, maintenance and ingredient degradation may be overcome by a novel micro-structured orifice called “Simultaneous Emulsification and Mixing” (SEM) [3], which will be presented {{in the second part of}} the talk. It combines the two unit operations ‘mixing’ and ‘emulsification’ in one single process unit, which results in significant energy and cost reduction, product quality improvement and process intensification. For this, an additional stream (e. g skim milk for dairy processes) is injected directly into the droplet disruption zone of a high-pressure disruption system. The design of these SEM-valves is based on CFD simulations of local flow conditions. The fabrication of the valve is realized with micro process engineering tools. The influences of product and process parameters on energy efficiency and product quality are discussed for the dairy process...|$|R

Patients with Niemann–Pick disease type C often have difficulties swallowing, and miglustat has an unpleasant <b>taste.</b> The <b>stability</b> of miglustat at 2 °C– 8 °C prepared in InOrpha® suspending vehicle, a liquid taste-masking agent, was assessed. Methods: The contents of Zavesca® 100 mg capsules (a powder blend comprising miglustat and several excipients) were transferred into InOrpha®. Although miglustat was soluble in InOrpha® at all concentrations tested, {{some of the}} excipients were not. An InOrpha® suspension containing 20 mg/mL miglustat was investigated initially. Subsequently, a pH-adjusted suspension of 20 mg/mL, and non-adjusted 10 and 5 mg/mL suspensions were evaluated. All suspensions were stored under refrigerated conditions. Physicochemical and microbiological challenge testing was performed at 0 hours and after 14 and 28 days. Degradation was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography, appearance was assessed visually, and pH was recorded. Suspensions were inoculated with seven species of bacteria, yeast, and mold, and growth evaluated using membrane filtration. Results: Miglustat 20 mg/mL suspension changed from yellow (0 hours) to brown (days 14 and 28); pH remained stable at 7. 4 – 7. 6. Pure InOrpha® (pH 4. 6) remained yellow throughout the study. Pure InOrpha® adjusted to pH 7. 5 displayed a brownish discoloration after 9 days. Miglustat 5 and 20 mg/mL suspensions, adjusted to pH 6. 5 and 4. 4, respectively, remained yellow at days 14 and 28.

Nowadays, increasing the interest for rediscovering the benefits, on scientific basis, of traditional fermented beverages based on cereals. Fermented mashes based on different cereal grist, namely Braga in Romanian, is a healthy and nutritious beverage, a source for new functional products with beneficial effects on human health. Physical-chemical and sensorial characteristics of these beverages depend on the ingredients and method of preparation. In this article was analyzed {{the influence of the}} five varieties of wheat on the main physical-chemical and sensorial characteristics of the fermented mashes obtained from grounded debranned millet (Panicum miliaceum), different species of wheat (Triticum aestivum - two variety, Triticum durum - one varieties, Triticum spelta - one variety and Triticum turgidum - one variety) and well modified Pilsner barley malt.

40|$|L-tartaric acid (TA) is {{accumulated}} to be {{the dominant}} organic acid in the grape (Vitis vinifera) berries and remains metabolically stable during berry ripening and the wine making process. It confers a low pH and a “sharp” flavor to wine, affecting many quality aspects such as colour, <b>taste,</b> microbial <b>stability</b> and aging potential. Exogenous TA is widely used as a flavorant and an antioxidant additive in the food and wine industry. The metabolic intermediates involved in the TA synthesis pathway in grapevine have been well characterized. The primary pathway utilizes L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) as the precursor which is sequentially converted to 2 -keto-L-gulonic acid (2 KLG), L-idonic acid (IA), 5 -keto-D-gluconic acid (5 KGA) and TA by several biochemical reactions. Only one candidate enzyme, V. vinifera L-idonate- 5 -dehydrogenase (LIDH, EC 1. 1. 1. 264), involved in this pathway has been characterized so far. It catalyzes the inter-conversion of IA and 5 KGA, the rate-limiting step of the TA biosynthesis pathway. In addition, another enzyme, a putative 2 -keto-L-gulonate reductase (VV 2 KR), which {{is assumed to be}} responsible for the reduction of 2 KLG to IA, has also been reported. However, further enzymatic characterization of this enzyme is still needed to validate its metabolic function in grapevine. The present study aims to investigate the molecular and structural characteristics of these two proteins, thereby improving our understanding on TA biosynthesis in grapevine. LIDH is highly homologous to sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH, EC 1. 1. 1. 14). We employed a computational approach to show that LIDH originates from the functional divergence of SDH in grapevine. We demonstrated that core eudicot (the strongly supported monophyletic group following the early-diverging eudicot lineages (Soltis, Senters et al. 2003)) SDHs have evolved into two distinctive phylogenetic lineages (Class I and Class II) due to positive natural selection after tandem gene duplication in the common ancestor of core eudicot plants. LIDH was identified as a Class II SDH. While the Class I SDH gene is universally conserved, Class II SDH genes are retained only in some plants including V. vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Theobroma cacao. The distribution of SDH genes among plant genomes showed a positive correlation between the occurrence of Class II SDH genes and the capacity for TA synthesis. These results provided new insights into the TA biosynthesis pathway from the evolutionary perspective. Protein modeling analyses revealed three amino acid substitutions at the catalytic sites between Class I and Class II SDHs. These three amino acid changes are suspected to be responsible for the unique enzymatic profile of LIDH. To confirm this hypothesis, Class I and Class II SDH genes from V. vinifera, T. cacao and S. tuberosum were cloned in this study. Site-mutations of the three amino acids were performed to assess their impact on enzyme substrate specificity. Recombinant protein of both wild-type and mutant SDHs from the above plants were expressed and purified. Enzyme kinetic tests confirmed that LIDH has a preference for L-idonate over D-sorbitol as its substrate. The Class I SDH from T. cacao demonstrated the highest activity with D-sorbitol but could hardly utilize L-idonate. The recombinant protein of the other SDHs could not be purified in this study due to troubles in protein induction and purification. Despite this, the preliminary results showed a significant enzymatic divergence between Class I and Class II SDHs, supporting the putative role of Class II SDHs in the TA biosynthesis pathway. In addition, a complete enzymatic characterization of the recombinant VV 2 KR was performed. VV 2 KR has the highest substrate specificity with D-glyoxylate, followed by hydroxypyruvate and 2 KLG. We showed that VV 2 KR could catalyze the reduction of 2 KLG to L-idonic acid effectively using NADPH as the preferred coenzyme. We went further to crystallize the recombinant VV 2 KR to determine its 3 -dimmentional structure. The ligand-free crystal structure of VV 2 KR was solved to a resolution of 2. 1 Å. VV 2 KR has the highest similarity with Coleus blumei hydroxypyruvate/glyoxylate reductase (CbHPR) and Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxypyruvate/glyoxylate reductase (AtHPR) isoform 2 (~ 75 % amino acid sequence identity). The VV 2 KR monomer structure adopts the typical folding of the D-isomer 2 -hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (2 KDH) proteins and has the highest structural homology with the CbHPR structure (main-chain atom Root Mean Square Deviation of 0. 76 Å; main-chain atom include all atoms in the peptide chain except those from the R-group, i. e. the side-chain). It represents the second plant HPR structure being determined to date. Structural comparison of VV 2 KR and CbHPR with other HPR structures revealed some unique structural features for plant HPRs. The commonly accepted substrates for HPRs (D-glyoxylate, hydroxypyruvate, pyruvate) and the 2 KLG intermediate from TA pathway were docked to the VV 2 KR structure by a computational method. The potential biological function of VV 2 KR in the TA biosynthesis pathway in grapevine was discussed. In summary, we focused on the molecular and structural characterization of the candidate enzymes responsible for TA biosynthesis in grapevine. The {{results of the present study}} highlighted the effects of enzyme structural variations on their in-vivo biological functions and significantly extended our understanding on the molecular mechanism of the TA biosynthesis pathway in grapevine.

40|$|Fish oils {{containing}} omega- 3 (ù 3) {{fatty acids}} {{are known to}} provide beneficial health effects and are added to various foods to improve their nutritional status. This research investigated the challenges of incorporating two types of ù 3 fish oil preparations into two commercially available fish sauces, namely abalone and oyster sauces, and examining the effects of such additions on sauce properties, acceptability and storage life. The ù 3 supplements both contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The first ù 3 supplement was refined non-winterised tuna oil and the second was microencapsulated tuna oil in which the oil was contained in microcapsules composed largely of caseinate. Both of these oils were incorporated at two levels of ù 3 fortification {{in accordance with the}} guidelines of the Australian and New Zealand Food Authority Food Standards Code 2004. Fortification increased the fishy taste of the sauces, which was: (a) more pronounced in the fortified abalone sauce than in the fortified oyster sauce; and (b) more pronounced in sauces fortified with refined non-winterised tuna oil than sauces fortified with microencapsulated tuna oil. Fortification of the sauces with the latter at the lowest level for a fortification claim of equivalent to no less than 30 mg total EPA and DHA per 30 g serving was found not to cause any significant difference in taste or preference between fortified and unfortified sauces used as controls. However, sedimentation and oil separation occurred. Morphological studies found this the result of disintegration of the microcapsules caused by precipitation of the caseinate in the encapsulation material at the pH of the sauces (4. 5  5. 2). The microencapsulated tuna oil was homogenized under different conditions to reduce the particle and oil globule sizes. The optimum fortification process was prior-homogenising the ù 3 ingredient in water for one minute at 3000 rpm and adding it at the beginning of processing and cooking together with all other ingredients to a sauce. During a scale-up pilot production, thinning (in both fortified abalone and oyster sauces) and dramatic separation (within two weeks of accelerated storage of the fortified abalone sauce) occurred. Image analysis revealed the absence of starch in the separated phases of the fortified abalone sauce. Amylase was detected in the microencapsulated oil and its activity traced to two materials used for its encapsulation. The enzyme had an optimum activity at pH 5. 4 and had 10 times higher activity at pH 5. 19 (pH of the fortified abalone sauce) than at pH 4. 55 (pH of the fortified oyster sauce). A laboratory experiment was carried out to modify the process of the pilot production. The modified process was scaled up for a second pilot production to produce a second batch of abalone sauce. It involved (a) changing the order of adding the prior-homogenized microencapsulated tuna oil i. e. adding it to partially cooked sauce at 85 oC instead of adding it at the beginning of processing and cooking with all ingredients to a sauce, and (b) lowering the pH of the fortified abalone sauce from 5. 2 to 4. 8. The amylolytic effect of the heat-stable amylase during cooking was reduced and this led to marked product improvement and shelflife extension. Thinning no longer occurred and the fortified abalone sauce showed no decrease in sensory scores during 32 weeks at 35 oC and 46 weeks at ambient. At 64 weeks at ambient the product still appeared stable, i. e. the Q 10 was 2. No loss in total EPA/DHA was found. In contrast, the fortified oyster sauce of the first pilot production showed decreases in viscosity and sensory scores during storage and reached the end of its shelf life at 12. 5 weeks at 35 oC and 26 weeks at ambient, i. e. the Q 10 was 2. 1. There was a near complete loss in total EPA and DHA content. In a study to replace citric acid with ascorbic acid to serve the possible multiple functions of acidification, antioxidation and nutritional enhancement, 0. 16 % ascorbic acid in fortified abalone sauce accelerated sauce separation. Its incorporation in abalone and oyster sauces (0. 16 % - 0. 5 %) reduced the Rancimat induction periods by 3 - 21 times, compared with the respective sauces containing citric acid used as controls. Of the two sauces fortified, the fortification of oyster sauce was found to be less demanding. There were fewer <b>taste,</b> appearance and <b>stability</b> problems, attributed to the sweeter characteristics of the oyster sauce which helped to mask the fishy taste. The use of caramel as a second thickener also made thinning due to starch hydrolysis by amylase less pronounced. By comparison, fishy odour and taste were more detectable in the fortified abalone sauce due to the inherently fishier and less sweet characteristics of this sauce. This sauce was also more prone to separation as it depended primarily on starch as a thickener. The above findings would be of benefit to the sauce industry. Particularly, the optimal fortification process would reduce costs and wastage for any manufacturer planning to embark on ù 3 fortification of sauces. Furthermore, various aspects of the above findings should be of interest to the food industry as a whole. For example, the finding that losses in total EPA & DHA paralleled reduction in viscosity would assist low viscosity food processors to pre-empt problems arising from losses of the ù 3 fatty acids when embarking on ù 3 fortification...|$|R
