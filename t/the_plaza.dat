5|$|The War Memorial and {{the parks}} in <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> are {{an example of}} the City Beautiful movement, which {{supported}} classical, uniform, and beautiful public architecture. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> covers a five-block strip north of Monument Circle between St. Clair, Pennsylvania, New York, and Meridian Streets. In 1989, <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it was named a National Historic Landmark District in 1994. The Historic District includes <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> as well as the Indianapolis Public Library, immediately north of <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> and the Birch Bayh Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, immediately south. The Scottish Rite Cathedral is across the street {{on the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is across the street on the east side.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> was {{originally}} named Ameritech Plaza for Ameritech Corporation, the corporate sponsor, who donated $3million for the sculpture-hosting plaza's naming rights. By {{the time the}} park officially opened in 2004, Ameritech had merged with SBC Communications and <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> was called SBC Plaza. When SBC acquired AT and subsequently changed the name from SBC to AT in 2005, the name of <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> changed again.|$|E

50|$|From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of <b>the</b> service <b>plazas</b> along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas {{are located}} in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a {{separate}} plaza for each direction of I-95). All of <b>the</b> renovated <b>plazas</b> feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, Dunkin Donuts, and Subway shops. McDonald's is also available at eight of <b>the</b> ten <b>plazas,</b> while <b>the</b> largest <b>plazas</b> additionally feature Sbarro, Panda Express and various other quick-service options.

500|$|Since {{the first}} section of the highway was built through a rural part of the state, food or {{gasoline}} was not easily available to motorists. Because of this, the commission decided to provide service plazas at [...] intervals. <b>The</b> <b>plazas</b> would be constructed of native fieldstone, resembling Colonial-era architecture. In 1940, Standard Oil of Pennsylvania was awarded a contract for ten Esso service stations along the turnpike. Eight of <b>the</b> service <b>plazas</b> would consist of service stations and a restaurant, while <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> at <b>the</b> halfway point (in Bedford) would be larger. The South Midway service <b>plaza</b> (<b>the</b> largest) contained a dining room, lunch counter, lounge and lodging for truckers; a tunnel connected it to the smaller North Midway <b>plaza.</b> <b>The</b> remaining service <b>plazas</b> were smaller, with a lunch counter. Food service at <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> was provided by Howard Johnson's. After World War II, the food facilities were enlarged; service stations sold gasoline, repaired cars and provided towing service.|$|R

500|$|After Quiriguá's pivotal {{victory over}} Copán in 738, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main {{group in the}} image of Copán itself. Thus, the acropolis, palace, and ballcourt all lie at the {{southern}} end of <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza.</b> <b>The</b> ceremonial centre is laid out around three <b>plazas,</b> <b>the</b> northernmost is <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza.</b> This plaza measures [...] from north to south and is <b>the</b> largest <b>plaza</b> in <b>the</b> whole Maya region. At the southern end of <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza</b> is <b>the</b> Ballcourt <b>Plaza,</b> surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. <b>The</b> Acropolis <b>Plaza</b> is a fully enclosed <b>plaza</b> within <b>the</b> acropolis itself. The area to the west of <b>the</b> Ballcourt <b>Plaza</b> was probably <b>the</b> riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza</b> was a marketplace. A number of ceramic-lined wells have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8thcentury and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.|$|R
50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of <b>the</b> <b>plaza's</b> northern half (carved {{out of the}} southeastern corner of Central Park), is the equestrian statue of William Tecumseh Sherman sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, while the principal feature of <b>the</b> <b>plaza's</b> southern half is the Pulitzer Fountain, topped with a bronze statue of the Roman goddess Pomona sculpted by Karl Bitter.|$|R
5|$|The AT Plaza is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3million for the naming right for <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT Corporation led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. During the holiday season, <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> hosts Christmas caroling.|$|E
5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through <b>the</b> <b>plaza</b> once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through <b>the</b> <b>plaza,</b> while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. <b>The</b> <b>plaza</b> has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he {{referred}} to as the High Plaza and the Low Plaza. The High Plaza is the area around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight adjoining structures divide the High Plaza from <b>the</b> <b>Plaza</b> of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, <b>the</b> <b>Plaza</b> is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E

25|$|Six rest areas/service plazas {{featuring}} parking lots, gas stations, {{and convenience}} stores were also built along the Merritt so that drivers {{would not have}} to exit to refuel. Pairs of plazas are located opposite each other {{on either side of the}} parkway in Fairfield (near exit 46), New Canaan (near exit 37), and Greenwich (just beyond the CT-NY state line). <b>The</b> northbound-side <b>plaza</b> in Greenwich also houses a Connecticut welcome center. <b>The</b> <b>plazas</b> were originally constructed during the Parkway's days as a tolled highway, but remained even after the tolls were removed in 1988, making the Parkway one of only a few toll-free highways with service plazas along its length. Between 2011 and 2015, all six of <b>the</b> service <b>plazas</b> (along with <b>the</b> four located further north along the Wilbur Cross Parkway) were completely renovated. The renovations preserved the original brick and stone facade of the buildings, but completely redesigned and modernized <b>the</b> interiors. <b>The</b> <b>plazas</b> now include more modern gas pumps, Alltown convenience stores, and a Dunkin' Donuts shop at each location; three of <b>the</b> Merritt's six <b>plazas</b> also include a Subway shop. Prior to the renovations, no fast-food service had previously been available at <b>the</b> <b>plazas.</b> <b>The</b> renovation project was completed during the summer of 2015, when <b>the</b> New Canaan <b>plazas</b> were reopened.|$|R

2500|$|The {{historic}} area {{is centered}} on two large plazas filled with Indian laurel trees called the Jardin del Centenario and the Jardín Hidalgo. [...] These plazas cover an area of 24,000m2, which were renovated, along with the areas around them in 2008. The green areas were rehabilitated, and areas were paved with red and black volcanic stone. [...] Renovation of <b>the</b> two <b>plazas</b> and <b>the</b> streets around them cost 88.3 million pesos. For over twenty five years, these plazas, especially <b>Plaza</b> Hidalgo, and <b>the</b> streets around them were filled with vendors (wandering and with stalls). When renovation efforts began, 150 vendors were removed from <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> proper with about 500 total including the surrounding streets. [...] While the practice was illegal, it had been tolerated by authorities, even though it caused damage to <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> and caused traffic problems. [...] One of the main goals of the renovation work in 2008 was to remove these vendors and move them to a new crafts bazaar built nearby. Initially, opposition to {{the removal of the}} vendors came not only from the vendors themselves, but also from some neighborhood groups and local businesses who feared their removal would hurt tourism. When renovation work finished in 2009, police were assigned to <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> to keep vendors from returning, leading to confrontations, both physically in <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> and legally in the courts. The borough began to issue some permits for vendors, but there was opposition. Eventually, a group representing the vendors obtained a court order to allow forty vendors to return to <b>the</b> <b>plazas,</b> citing <b>the</b> history of tolerating such activity in the past. This order is still opposed by some neighborhood groups, but as of 2010, there are still a limited number of these vendors selling in <b>the</b> <b>plazas.</b>|$|R
