40|$|UV-B {{radiation}} (280 – 315 nm), {{incident on}} the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians growing at Rothera Point on the Western Antarctic Peninsula, was manipulated in late austral spring 1998 by screens {{consisting of a}} novel combination of Plexiglas panes and polyester sheets. The screens transmitted approximately 79, 68, 48, 41 and 31 % of daily UV-B radiation dose. Plants from under and outside the screens were sampled seven times over 35 days. Correlative analyses indicated that concentrations of an anthocyanin-like pigment located in leaf tips were positively associated with UV-B transmission at the last two samplings, that concentrations of total chlorophylls were negatively associated with UV-B transmission at the final sampling, and that those of UV-B screening pigments were positively correlated with transmission at three intermediate samplings. Plants exposed to low UV-B <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> were visibly greener than those exposed to high <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> after approximately 23 days. The closest relationships between the treatment and concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were associated with increased ambient biologically weighted UV-B dose received by plants in the 5. 5 h before each sampling, which coincided {{with the passage of}} the ozone hole over Rothera Point. As C. varians emerged from melting snow and ice, concentrations of the anthocyanin-like pigment and chlorophyll respectively increased and decreased faster in plants exposed to high <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> of UV-B, relative to those exposed to low UV-B <b>transmission</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

Cost of PF and THD impact {{is difficult to}} estimate, but it causes heat and vibration, malfunctioning and even meltdowns. The electric company monitors the <b>transmission</b> <b>level.</b> A spectrum of compensation devices mitigate bad outcomes, but improvements can be achieved only with real-time Correction devices (old style switching type, modern low-speed DSP driven and near real-tim). Most modern devices reduce problems, while maintaining return on investment and significant reduction of ground currents. Another reason to mitigate the problems is to reduce operation and generation costs, which is commonly done by Electric Power Distribution companies in conjunction with generation companies. Power quality problems can cause erroneous responses from many kinds of analog and digital equipment, where the response could be unpredictable.|$|E

At <b>transmission</b> <b>level,</b> SONET self-healing ring for restoration is a viable alternative for a major failure such as a fiber cable cut [27]. However, {{it may not be}} possible to provide for such <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> restoration for every type of networks or failures, especially in a wide-area networking environment (e. g. if the network is based on leased capacity from various vendors, all of whom may not have transmission restoration; or, it is not cost-effective to provide adequate transmission network restoration; or, <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> restoration may not be applicable in certain failure scenarios, such as a line card or a de...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Several MAC layer {{power control}} {{protocols}} {{have been proposed}} to address the limited power supplies in ad hoc networks. Recent protocols suggest varying the transmission power such that the RTS/CTS handshake is done at the maximum, and the Data-ACK are transmitted at the minimum necessary <b>transmission</b> power <b>level.</b> It has also been suggested to periodically use maximum transmission power during Data transmission. However, using the maximum <b>transmission</b> power <b>level</b> in RTS/CTS handshake does not solve the hidden node problem and in fact causes throughput degradation. Also, IEEE 802. 11 does not allow the power levels {{to change in the}} same transmission. In this paper, we review different power control MAC protocols, and analyze the effect of <b>transmission</b> power <b>levels</b> on the hidden node problem and the throughput. We then propose an efficient low-power MAC protocol tha...|$|R
