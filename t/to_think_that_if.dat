2500|$|The {{essay was}} {{intended}} to frighten gay men and anger them {{to the point where}} they would respond to government indifference. [...] Michael Specter writes in The New Yorker, [...] "it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America– officials at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, in Washington, doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor Ed Koch)– of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent AIDS epidemic. The article's harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they ignored the new disease, it would simply go away.|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, {{felt the}} verdict was fair because the {{prosecution}} {{did not have enough}} evidence to establish guilt or meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Hannity said that {{the verdict was}} legally correct, and that all of the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was either impeached or contradicted by the defense. John Cloud of Time magazine echoed these sentiments, saying the jury made the right call: [...] "Anthony got off because the prosecution couldn't answer ," [...] Cloud stated. [...] "Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on Anthony's (nearly imperceptible) moral character. The prosecutors seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{element of}} British public and {{political}} sentiment favoured a negotiated peace with Germany, among them Halifax as Foreign Secretary. Over {{three days in}} May (26–28 May 1940), there were repeated discussions within the War Cabinet of whether the UK should associate itself with French approaches to Mussolini to use his good offices with Hitler to seek a negotiated peace: they terminated in refusal to do so. Various interpretations are possible of this episode and of Churchill's argument that [...] "it was idle <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out", but throughout Churchill seems to have opposed any immediate peace negotiations. Although at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory—Churchill told Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time"—his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British for a long war.|$|E
2500|$|George did {{not accept}} this explanation. He wrote, [...] "I am {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> all wealth consisted of such things as planes, and all production was {{such as that of}} carpenters – that is to say, if wealth consisted but of the inert matter of the universe, and production of working up this inert matter into different shapes – that interest would be but the robbery of industry, and could not long exist." [...] But some wealth is inherently fruitful, like a pair of breeding cattle, or a vat of grape juice soon to ferment into wine. Planes and other sorts of inert matter (and the most lent item of all – money itself) earn interest indirectly, by being part of the same [...] "circle of exchange" [...] with fruitful forms of wealth such as those, so that tying up these forms of wealth over time incurs an opportunity cost.|$|E
2500|$|McCaughey died of {{lung cancer}} on 8 February 2006. He was {{believed}} to have contracted cancer over a year previously and was thought to be in remission after treatment. The local Ballymena Times reported, [...] "McCaughey apparently underwent a 'Road To Damascus' style conversion - supporting the peace process and leading a campaign against Neo Nazis". A tribute was also reported from a leading Irish Trade Unionist Peter Bunting. Bunting's father was once held at gun point by McCaughey in 1971 due to the fact he was a Catholic and was forced to leave his job. Bunting stated [...] "Billy McCaughey was prepared to kill for what he saw as his people. At the end of his days, he had lived for more people than he could have ever dreamed about in 1971. I would also like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> my father had lived long enough to witness the full life of Billy McCaughey, then he too would have recognised him as a brother and a comrade." [...] David Ervine described him as having an [...] "immense effect on people's attitudes." [...] He was buried in his native Ahoghill.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some time}} {{neither of us}} offered any suggestion, for we knew very little indeed about the suburbs of London. At last I said, [...] "I think Harry I should like to be somewhere near the river, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> would suit you {{as well as any}} other side of London. When we were at Grendon House, we used to go up the river to Kew in a steamer, once or twice every summer, on the Miss Pilgrims' birthdays, and grand {{occasions}} of that sort, and I remember I used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> myself, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I were to live in London, I should like it to be near the river." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, 'tis a bad {{wind that}} blows good to nobody. As The Mahmoud was lost off the Balearics, it cannot {{have been her}} that put the marauders on shore and trained her big guns on Ilsin. We take it, therefore, that the latter {{must have been a}} pirate, and as we have taken her {{derelict}} in our waters, she is now ours in all ways. Anyhow, she is ours, and is the first ship of her class in the navy of the Blue Mountains. I am inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> she was--or is still--a Turkish ship, Admiral Rooke would not be inclined to let her go. As for Captain Desmond, I think he would go straight out of his mind if such a thing was to be even suggested to him.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{arguments}} {{for and against}} a truth-relativist semantics for propositional knowledge attributions (KTR) have been debated almost exclusively {{in the philosophy of}} language. But what implications would this semantic thesis have in epistemology? This question has been largely unexplored. The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish and critique several ramifications of KTR in mainstream epistemology. The first section of the paper develops, over a series of arguments, the claim that MacFarlane’s (2005; 2010) core argument for KTR ultimately motivates (for better or worse) the extension of a truth-relativist semantics to a subset of understanding attributions—attributions of understanding-why. I conclude by presenting some reasons <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> KTR were otherwise plausible, a truth-relativist semantics for understanding-why attributions is not. These claims, taken together, constitute a kind of epistemological argument against MacFarlane-style truth-relativism for knowledge attributions...|$|R

Anyway, your son's description was quite straight. He seemed sure of him." ...|$|R

"Well, it is {{a comfort}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> we had sailed direct here from Porto Rico {{we should not}} have caught her," [...] Frank said to George Lechmere.

No doubt they got some fishermen to bring them into the creek. Well, there is nothing to do but to turn her head west. It is but forty-eight hours' sail to San Domingo, and I fancy that it is likely that he will have stopped there. You see on the chart that there are numberless bays, {{and there would be no}} fear of questions being asked by the blacks. If we don't find him there we must try Cuba; but San Domingo is by far the most likely place for him to choose for his headquarters, and there are at least four biggish rivers he could sail up, beside a score of smaller ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{most that}} could plausibly be said against {{him was that}} he was a friend of the senior civil servant Edward Colman, an ardent and {{politically}} active Catholic, who was executed for his supposed part in the Plot in December 1678, and that Colman had visited Belasyse the night before he gave himself up to the authorities. However Colman in fact seems to have been guilty of nothing more than indiscreet correspondence with the French Court in which he outlined his wildly impractical schemes for the advancement of the Catholic faith in England. There is no reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Belasyse, even <b>if</b> he knew of this correspondence, shared Colman's political opinions.|$|R
