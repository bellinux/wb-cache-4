40|$|I. Mechanism of {{halogenated}} hydrocarbon oxidation We are using poplar culture cells {{to determine the}} pathway of TCE metabolism. In our earlier work, we found that <b>trichloroethanol</b> (TCEOH) is a major early intermediate. Our studies this year {{have focused on the}} steps that follow this toxic intermediate. We did several experiments to track the disappearance of TCEOH after the cells were removed from TCE. We could conclude that TCEOH is not an end-product but is rapidly degraded. Six flasks of poplar liquid suspension cells were exposed to a level of 50 {micro}g/ml TCE for three days. Three of the cultures were subjected to MTBE extractions to quantify the levels of TCEOH produced. The cells of the remaining three cultures were then pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium. After three more days, these were also subjected to MTBE extractions. The samples were analyzed by GC-ECD. After the three days of further metabolism, an average of 91 % of the <b>trichloroethanol</b> was gone. When similar experiments were done with intact plants and both free and conjugated TCEOH were quantified, a similar rapid decline in both forms was seen (Shang, 2001). Therefore, it seems probable that similar mechanisms are taking place in both poplar suspension cells and whole poplar plants, so we continued to do our studies with the suspension cells. Metabolism of <b>trichloroethanol</b> may go through trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) prior to dehalogenation. To test this possibility, we exposed cells to TCE and analyzed for TCAA over time. The cultures were analyzed after 4, 5, 6, and 14 days from TCE exposure. We did not detect any significant amount of TCAA above the background in undosed cells. To determine if <b>trichloroethanol</b> itself is directly dehalogenated, we analyzed TCE-exposed cells for the presence of dichloroethanol. Undosed cells did not have any of the DCEOH peak but TCE-dosed cells that produced the highest levels of <b>trichloroethanol</b> did have a small DCEOH peak. Cultures that did not produce high levels of TCEOH did not have the DCEOH peak. This result repeated in two independent experiments. We decided to expose cells directly to TCEOH and look for DCEOH in the cell extracts. After one week of exposure, the culture cells produced consistent levels of DCEOH of approximately 0. 02 % of the TCEOH dose. However, when we did a control reaction with no cells, DCEOH was present, indicating that the TCEOH degrades in the absence of cells. We are currently conducting the same experiments with newly-purchased chemicals and in darkness (by wrapping the culture flasks in foil). We have had success using tribromoethanol as a surrogate for <b>trichloroethanol</b> in studying the dehalogenation reaction in poplar cells. We had previously shown that tribromoethanol is steadily metabolized over time in poplar culture cells, producing free bromide ion. TBEOH-dosed dead cells and no cell controls did not have any bromide ion production. We are currently using this system to test P 450 inhibitors to determine if dehalogenation of TBEOH is through this mechanism. We have recently purchased tribromoethylene as a more easily monitored surrogate for TCE. We will conduct mass balance experiments to determine what percentage of the bromide is released from tribromoethylene...|$|E

Urine samples collected from 85 male workers were analysed for total trichloro-compounds (TTC), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). <b>Trichloroethanol</b> (TCE) was estimated by difference. Statistical analyses of the data revealed that the urinary concentrations of both TTC and TCE were proportional to the atmospheric concentration of trichloroethylene.

40|$|Background {{potassium}} currents play {{an important}} role in the regulation of the resting membrane potential and excitability of mammalian neurons. Recently cloned two- pore domain potassium channels (K 2 p) are believed to underlie these currents. The roles of K 2 P channels in general anesthesia and neuroprotection have been proposed recently. In view of this, we investigated the ability of <b>trichloroethanol</b> (an active metabolite of the non-volatile general anesthetic cldoral hydrate, widely used as a pediatric sedative) to modulate the activity of human TREK- 1 and TRAAK channels. We found that <b>trichloroethanol</b> potently activates both hTREK- 1 and hTRAAK channels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The parent compound chloral hydrate was also found to augtnent the activity of both the channels reversibly. Studies with carboxy- terminal deletion mutants (hTREK- 1 A 89, hTREK- 1 A 100 and hTREK- 1 A 1 19), suggested that C-terminal tail is not essential for the activation of TREK- 1 by <b>trichloroethanol.</b> Our findings identify TREK- 1 and TRCL 4 K channels as molecular targets for <b>trichloroethanol</b> and we propose that activation of both these channels might contribute to the CNS depressant effects of chloral hydrate. Another channel TASK- 2, which is essentially absent in the human brain was also found to be potently activated by both <b>trichloroethanol</b> and chloral hydrate. In another series of experiments, we studied the effects of methyl xanthines caffeine and theophylline on hTREK- 1 channels. Caffeine and theophylline are used for therapeutic purposes and frequently cause life-threatening convulsive seizures due to systemic toxicity. The mechanisms for the epileptogenicity of caffeine and theophylline are not clear. Recent experiments using knockout mice provided direct evidence for a role for TREK- 1 in the control of epileptogenesis. We hypothesized that the epileptogenicity of caffeine and theophylline may be related to the inhibition of TREK- 1 channels. We investigated this possibility and observed massive inhibition of TREK- 1 channels at toxicologically relevant concentrations. Experiments with the mutant TREK- 1 channel (S 348 A mutant) suggested the involvement of cANP/PKA pathway in the inhibition of TREK- 1 channels by caffeine and theophylline. We suggest that inhibition of TREK- 1 channels may contribute to the convulsive seizures induced by toxic levels of caffeine and theophylline. Local anesthetics exhibit their clinical effects not only by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels, but also by interacting with other ion channels such as potassium channels. Because of the physiological significance of TREK- 1 channels and their abundant expression in peripheral sensory neurons, we investigated the effects of lidocaine to see whether its interaction with 'REK- 1 channels contribute to the conduction blockade. Lidocaine caused dose-dependent inhibition of TREK- 1 channels and the inhibition was voltage-independent. Cytoplasmic C-terminal tail is critically required for lidocaine action. Inhibition of TREK- 1 channels is achieved at concentrations for iiz vivo action and this effect may have implications for the clinically observed drug action of lidocaine...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are fundamental molecules in {{the nervous system}} that catalyze the flux of ions across the cell membrane. Ion channel flux activity {{is comparable to the}} catalytic activity of enzyme molecules. Saturating concentrations of substrate induce “dynamic disorder” in the kinetic rate processes of single-enzyme molecules and consequently, develop correlative “memory” of the previous history of activities. Similarly, binding of ions as substrate alone or in presence of agonists affects the catalytic turnover of single-ion channels. Here, we investigated the possible existence of dynamic disorder and molecular memory in the single human-TREK 1 -channel due to binding of substrate/agonist using the excised inside–out patch-clamp technique. Our results suggest that the single-hTREK 1 -channel behaves as a typical Michaelis–Menten enzyme molecule with a high-affinity binding site for K+ ion as substrate. But, in contrast to enzyme, dynamic disorder in single-hTREK 1 -channel was not induced by substrate K+ binding, but required allosteric modification of the channel molecule by the agonist, <b>trichloroethanol.</b> In addition, interaction of <b>trichloroethanol</b> with hTREK 1 induced strong correlation in the waiting time and flux intensity, exemplified by distinct mode-switching between high and low flux activities. This suggested the induction of molecular memory in the channel molecule by the agonist, which persisted for several decades in time.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (150 and 300 mg/kg b. w.) on urinary <b>trichloroethanol</b> and trichloroacetic acid excretion and the liver cytochrome P- 450 -dependent monooxygenase system (MFO) in rats treated with trichloroethylene (TRI) alone or with xylene (XYL) at a concentration of 4. 5 mmol/m 3 air. The study has shown that xylene equally decreased trichloroacetic acid and <b>trichloroethanol</b> excretion within 48 hours after exposure. Acetylsalicylic acid diminished the excretion of both trichloroethy-lene metabolites in a dose-dependent manner, although the effect was weaker than that of xylene. Liver cytochrome P- 450 content tended to increase after both doses of ASA. There were no significant changes in cytochrome b 5 content and the activities of NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductases. TRI decreased cytochrome P- 450 and cytochrome b 5 contents and reduced both reductase activ-ities. XYL induced all MFO components. Acetylsalicylic acid at 150 mg/kg combined with TRI inhalation tended to lower cytochrome b 5 content and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase activity. When given at 300 mg/kg, ASA increased cytochrome P- 450 content, while cytochrome b 5 content and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase activity were still decreased, but to a smaller degree {{when compared with the}} lower ASA dose. XYL together with the lower dose of ASA induced the MFO system. Exposure to XYL and the higher dose of ASA elevated cytochrome P- 450 content and NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase activity and it diminished NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase activity. In rats treated simultaneously with ASA, XYL and TRI both cytochromes increased in amount, while the other components of the MFO system did not change...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the evidence that}} trichloroethylene (TCE) or its metabolites might mediate tumor formation via a mutagenic mode of action. We review and draw conclusions from the published mutagenicity and genotoxicity information for TCE and its metabolites, chloral hydrate (CH), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), <b>trichloroethanol,</b> S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -l-cysteine (DCVC), and S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) glutathione (DCVG). The new U. S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed Cancer Risk Assessment Guidelines provide for {{an assessment of the}} key events involved in the development of specific tumors. Consistent with this thinking, we provide a new and general strategy for interpreting genotoxicity data that goes beyond a simple determination that the chemical is or is not genotoxic. For TCE, we conclude that the weight of the evidence argues that chemically induced mutation is unlikely to be a key event in the induction of human tumors that might be caused by TCE itself (as the parent compound) and its metabolites, CH, DCA, and TCA. This conclusion derives primarily from the fact that these chemicals require very high doses to be genotoxic. There is not enough information to draw any conclusions for <b>trichloroethanol</b> and the two trichloroethylene conjugates, DCVC and DCVG. There is some evidence that DCVC is a more potent mutagen than CH, DCA, or TCA. Unfortunately, definitive conclusions as to whether TCE will induce tumors in humans via a mutagenic mode of action cannot be drawn from the available information. More research, including the development and use of new techniques, is required before it is possible to make a definitive assessment as to whether chemically induced mutation is a key event in any human tumors resulting from exposure to TCE...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} initial {{results of a}} series of {{molecular}} modelling studies to investigate the structural properties of non-steroidal inhibitors required for inhibitory activity against the enzyme estrone sulfatase (ES) [the enzyme responsible for the conversion of nonactive (sulfated) estrone to the active (nonsulfated) estrone]. From {{the results of the present}} study, we conclude that the C(17) polar group may not be necessary for inhibitory activity and that the only requirement appears to be the mimicking of the steroid C(3) sulfonate group. To test our hypotheses, we have designed novel straight chain inhibitors based upon alkyl alcohols, which upon evaluation, have been shown to possess inhibitory activity (e. g., an inhibitor based upon <b>trichloroethanol</b> has been shown to possess 46 % inhibition at 0. 76 mM) ...|$|E

40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) {{exposure}} {{has been}} associated with increased risk of liver and kidney cancer in both laboratory animal and epidemiologic studies. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001 draft TCE risk assessment concluded {{that it is difficult to}} determine which TCE metabolites may be responsible for these effects, the key events involved in their modes of action (MOAs), and the relevance of these MOAs to humans. In this article, which is part of a minimonograph on key issues in the health risk assessment of TCE, we present a review of recently published scientific literature examining the effects of TCE metabolites in the context of the preceding questions. Studies of the TCE metabolites dichloroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and chloral hydrate suggest that both DCA and TCA are involved in TCE-induced liver tumorigenesis and that many DCA effects are consistent with conditions that increase the risk of liver cancer in humans. Studies of S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -L-cysteine have revealed a number of different possible cell signaling effects that may be related to kidney tumorigenesis at lower concentrations than those leading to cytotoxicity. Recent studies of <b>trichloroethanol</b> exploring an alternative hypothesis for kidney tumorigenesis have failed to establish the formation of formate as a key event for TCE-induced kidney tumors. Overall, although MOAs and key events for TCEinduced liver and kidney tumors have yet to be definitively established, these results support the likelihood that toxicity is due to multiple metabolites through several MOAs, none of which appear to be irrelevant to humans.
