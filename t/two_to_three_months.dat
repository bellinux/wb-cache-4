5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts nearly <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> {{following}} which {{a litter}} consisting {{of one to}} six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1986 Time {{series of}} monthly means up to 65 years long were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} time and spatial scales of variablity in the Gulf of Alaska.

This study reports four major results. 1) Sea level anomalies (variations from the annual cycle) are driven by wind and fresh water; temperature effects in sea level are not seen. 2) SST anomalies cannot be predicted from sea level data, but SLP in southeastern Alaska and air temperature in Seward may be useful indicators on a <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> time scale. 3) On the whole, anomalies in coastal and interior Alaska weather occur together, with SLP 180 ° out of phase with air temperature and precipitation.
