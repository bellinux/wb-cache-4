5|$|After peaking, Isidore {{entered a}} region of {{stronger}} upper-level winds and quickly weakened. By September8 it had deteriorated into a tropical storm, although re-intensification occurred after the shear decreased. An eye feature redeveloped {{in the center of}} the convection, and Isidore re-intensified into a hurricane on September 9. It ultimately reached a secondary peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h). Isidore's motion slowed, briefly becoming stationary, although it remained a hurricane for several days. Cooler waters imparted weakening to a tropical storm on September16, and the next day it became extratropical to the east of Newfoundland. There were a few ships <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> contact with Hurricane Isidore, one of which reported hurricane-force wind gusts. The storm never approached land during its duration, and no damage or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, the 6th Division was {{dispatched}} to Greece, where they fought {{a very brief}} campaign following the German invasion of that country {{in the middle of}} the month. Overwhelmed, the Allied forces were forced back over the course of several weeks during which the 2/6th took part in several desperate rearguard actions and withdrawals during which the battalion lost 28 men killed and 43 wounded. Finally, they were evacuated by sea at the end of the month, but amidst the confusion a large of the battalion's personnel– 217 personnel from all ranks– were captured, while others were landed on Crete, instead of Alexandria in Egypt, after the ship on which they were sailing, the Costa Rica, was sunk. On Crete, 13 officers and 202 other ranks from the 2/6th were organised into a 17th Brigade composite battalion along with men from the brigade's other battalions less the 2/7th. They subsequently fought unsuccessfully to repulse the German invasion <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> May, after which many more became prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|In the ballpark's inaugural game on April 17, 2015, the Sounds {{defeated}} the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, {{courtesy of a}} walk-off double hit by Max Muncy that scored Billy Burns from first base. Nashville's Arnold León recorded the first strikeout at First Tennessee Park when Colorado Springs' Matt Long struck out swinging as the leadoff hitter {{at the top of}} the first inning. The park's first hit was a left field single <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the top of the second inning off the bat of Colorado Springs' Matt Clark, who played for the Sounds in 2014. Clark also recorded the stadium's first RBI, slapping a single to center field in the fourth inning that sent Luis Sardiñas across the plate for the park's first run. The first home run in the park's history was hit by Nashville's Joey Wendle four games later on April 21 against the Oklahoma City Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|Michigan scored {{first when}} Cameron Gordon {{picked up a}} Purdue fumble and ran it back 58 yards for a touchdown, their first {{defensive}} points of the season. They added to their lead {{a few minutes later}} with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. Purdue scored their first points late in the first quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, and then added more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie a few minutes later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come any closer. Early in the third quarter, Michigan's Vincent Smith ran in a 19-yard touchdown, but the extra point failed. Purdue's only score of the second half was a 40-yard field goal <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the third quarter. Michigan sealed their win late in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run by Stephen Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's {{foreign-born}} {{population grew}} 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese {{population in the}} Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong Province. The Seattle area {{is also home to}} a large Vietnamese population of more than 55,000 residents, as well as over 30,000 Somali immigrants. The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the United States, numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans, and one of the largest Samoan communities in the mainland U.S., with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry. Additionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau.

5|$|Kohli had a {{successful}} time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> 17.2 overs, Kohli's innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360 {{for the loss of}} one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase. He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat, before the next two matches were washed out by rain. In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help Indi{{a successful}}ly chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match. He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket. India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Giddens {{delivered}} the BBC Reith Lectures {{on the subject}} of ‘Runaway World’, subsequently published as a book of that title. The aim was to introduce the concept and implications of globalisation to a lay audience. He was the first Reith Lecturer to deliver the lectures in different places around the world; and the first to respond directly to e-mails <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> while he was speaking. The lectures were delivered in London, Washington, New Delhi and Hong Kong and responded to by local audiences. Giddens received the Asturias Prize for the social sciences in 2002. The award has been labelled ‘the Spanish Nobel Prize’, but stretches well beyond the sphere of science. Other recipients of the Prize that year included Woody Allen, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and conductor Daniel Barenboim.|$|E
25|$|These tactics further enraged {{natives and}} {{intensified}} resistance to Russian rule. The Russian army was thus frustrated {{by a combination}} of highly mobile (often mounted) raiders and evasive guerrillas with superior terrain knowledge. The Circassian resistance continued, with villages that had previously accepted Russian rule often found resisting again. Furthermore, the Circassian cause began to arouse sympathies in the West, especially Britain of whom assistance was sought <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the form of intermediaries and spies from the 1830s and during the Crimean War. More substantive British assistance never arrived as support for the Circassian cause subsided after the Crimean War as the region was considered far away from British concerns. Imam Shamil in the Northeast Caucasus, meanwhile, had tried to win over their support for his own struggle against Russia on numerous occasions, but the Circassians were largely cold toward his overtures. After he surrendered to Russia, their resistance continued unabated.|$|E
25|$|The Mbunda also fought {{alongside}} the Aluyi against the Tonga in the 1880s, emerging victory as the Tonga had no {{defense against the}} Mbunda‘s skill with a bow and arrow, resulting in the Lozi/Mbunda and Tonga Cousinship. Later the Kaonde/Lozi war which Lozis won {{with the help of}} the Mbunda war machinery, resulting in the Mbunda Chieftainship of Chief Mwene Kasimba having firmly been established there at the confluence of the Lalafuta and Kyamenge in 1893, opposite Chief Mushima Njivumina of the Kaonde. In honoring the Mulambwa/Chiyengele Treaty, the Mbunda have remained the true allies of the Aluyi both in military and political matters. The Mbunda lived peacefully, tendering their cattle and growing cassava, maize and rice, while many of the men left their homes to work in the South African mines. With Zambia independence from British rule <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> 1964, the practice was discouraged and the men were then recruited to work on the sugar plantations of Zambia.|$|E
