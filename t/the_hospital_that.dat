5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> <b>That</b> night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

Near {{the end of that}} month, after one of these trips Butler told <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>that</b> she (Butler) might have contracted rubella, to which Genie would have been exposed. Hospital staff were reluctant to give foster custody to Butler and were very skeptical of her story, strongly suspecting she had concocted it as part of a bid to take over as Genie's guardian and primary caretaker, but decided that placing Genie in an isolation ward at the hospital could potentially be highly damaging to her social and psychological development, so they agreed to temporarily quarantine her in Butler's home. Butler, who was childless, unmarried, and at the time living alone, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections authorities extended Genie's stay while they considered the matter.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, Whitehead {{enrolled}} at the Manchester Royal School of Medicine, {{also known as the}} Chatham Street Medical School. He did so without telling his parents and by borrowing money from a cousin for the purpose. Concurrent with the early years of his training, and as was usual at the time, he was apprenticed for 18months to the general practice of Drs. Harris and Bennett in Bury. These two men also acted as medical officers appointed by the Board of Guardians of the Bury Poor Law Union; Bennett alone was attending an average of 860 cases per annum for the Union around this time and Whitehead was thus exposed to work specifically relating to the conditions of the poor as well as general dispensing. The experience gained during this initial period subsequently enabled him to act as a locum tenens at the Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI), where he mingled with qualified physicians and surgical staff, watched operations and witnessed the administrative workings of a hospital. So much of his time was spent at <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>that</b> it became his primary residence; he also spent six months working in the infirmary at Withington workhouse.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{troublesome}} 1980 {{season with}} suspension from {{the league and}} {{a victory for the}} Mapua Cardinals, the Letran Knights started the 1982 season under the tutelage of new coach Coach Larry Albano which featured a very exciting player named Samboy Lim. Samboy Lim is a graduate of San Beda High School and also played for the San Beda Red Cubs (the Juniors Basketball team of San Beda). After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued to pile up victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of #2 ranked San Sebastian. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th trophy was still presented to them. In 1983, the heavily favored Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball due to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of resting in the hospital (he suffered an asthma attack in Game 2 and has to be sent in <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>that</b> night) and captured their 2nd straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season but Samboy Lim's heroics left an indelible impression to the hearts of those who witnessed it. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only 5 schools participating but it didn't distract the Knights as they secured a date with history as the become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season and RP Team patron Danding Cojuangco gave him a spot on the National Team roster.|$|E

According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour [...] "bordered on psychotic". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty.

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>that</b> set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
