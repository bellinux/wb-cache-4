50|$|Early {{scholars}} had {{tended to}} view the peopling of Australia {{as the result of}} three separate waves of immigration, with distinct human types. Birtdsell took a biological approach and did extensive work on anthropometrics to buttress his conjecture. This <b>trihybrid</b> model was resurrected and espoused by Birdsell, and became a standard part of Australian history down from the 1940s. It was adopted by the then doyen of Australian historians, Manning Clark in his 6 volume history of the country. In a recent polemic, Keith Windschuttle and Tom Gittin observed that the model had dropped from view, and attributed political motives to its disappearance off the popular and academic radar. McNiven and Russell argue that the <b>trihybrid</b> theory was discarded as the natural outcome of advances in archaeological work on the populating of the Australian continent, and that Birdwell's theory's initial popularity was due to the old colonial mentality informing opinion, which saw in the successive wave theory support for the dispossession (in a fourth wave) of Aborigines and to undermine native title claims.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trihybrid</b> thesis {{had been}} {{advanced}} {{in the late}} 19th century redolent of early ideas concerning supposed pure racial types, which posited that Australia had been populated by 3 successive waves of peoples. Supposedly these were {{the remnants of the}} hypothetical first wave of peoples to enter Australia, who were then thrust aside by further immigrations, successively undertaken by two distinct peoples with a superior hunting technology. The Tindale-Birdsell argument had revived this model. Birdsell in particular argued that the putative Negrito type surviving in the tropical forests of northern Queensland, were to be taken as Barrineans. He linked them to the Andamanese, arguing they were a 'pygmy' group that was the residue of the wave otherwise represented by the 'extinct' Tasmanian aboriginals. They had retreated into the rainforest as waves of the light-skinned Murrayians affiliated to the Ainu came through. The third group were the Carpentarians, a dark people with a pronounced brow ridge, whom it was thought were affiliated to ancient Indian tribes.|$|E
40|$|A silver ion (Ag+) -triggered {{thixotropic}} metallo(organo) gel of p-pyridyl-appended oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) derivatives (OPVs) {{is reported}} for the first time. Solubilization of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) in solutions of the pure OPVs {{as well as in}} the metallogels mediated by pi-pi interactions has also been achieved. In situ fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the SWCNH-doped dihybrid gel leads to the formation of a <b>trihybrid</b> metallogel. The mechanical strength of the metallogels could be increased step- wise in the order: freshly prepared gel <dihybrid gel < <b>trihybrid</b> gel. Microscopic studies of the <b>trihybrid</b> gel indicate the formation of three distinct morphologies, that is, nanoscale metal organic particles (NMOPs), flowerlike aggregates of SWCNHs and AgNPs, and also their integration with each other. Detailed studies suggest lamellar organizations of the linear metal ligand complexes in the NMOPs, which upon association create a three-dimensional network that eventually immobilizes the solvent molecules...|$|E
40|$|Maize genotypes Giza 2 (drought tolerant) and <b>Trihybrid</b> 321 (drought sensitive) were sown in {{the small}} pots under {{laboratory}} condition. Water stress condition was created by irrigating the pots with polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions of 0. 0, - 5, - 10 and - 20 bars and observations were made on 21 -day-old seedlings. The tolerant genotype Giza 2 exhibited lower accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H 2 O 2 content related to increasing activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1), catalase (CAT, EC 1. 11. 1. 6), and peroxidase compounds (POX, EC 1. 11. 1. 7), under water stress conditions. The higher water retention capacity and lower membrane injury made Giza 2 more drought tolerant. Drought stress was resulted by accumulation of gylycinebetain (GB) and free proline (PRO) in both cultivars. The magnitude of increase in both omsolytes was higher in Giza 2 than in <b>Trihybrid</b> 321. We suggest that free proline and gylycinebetaine accumulation in the leaves {{can be used as}} the possible indicator for drought tolerance in maize genotypes. Water deficits induced an increased level of photosynthetic activity (14 CO 2 -fixation) in Giza 2 than <b>Trihybrid</b> 321. Therefore, it can be concluded that the stress tolerance mechanism exists at seedling stage of maize genotypes. The Giza 2 is comparatively tolerant to water stress owing to the lower increase in H 2 O 2 and MDA content along with higher increase in PRO, GB accumulation, photosynthetic efficiency, SOD, CAT and POX activities. The higher membrane stability index and high water retention capacity might have also imparted water stress tolerance in Giza 2. Further, <b>Trihybrid</b> 321 was also able to resist water stress to some extent via the above adjustments...|$|E

In both di/trihybrid the MSF unit was operated successfully at 120 ºC without further acidification, antiscalant or antifoam. The paper summarizes the MSF performance, which was established at Top Brine Temperature (TBT) operating 120 ºC, in the dihybrid NF-MSF and <b>trihybrid</b> NF-SWRO reject – MSF systems. Because of the excellent MSF performance at this TBT of 120 ºC, the paper also addresses the planned operation of MSF at elevated TBT of 120 to 160 ºC and above. These gained advantages in improved performance of MSF when make-up is directly or indirectly from NF (in di or <b>trihybrid,</b> respectively) triggered a review of dual power and water production cycle of boiler turbine generator: BTG & multistage flash: MSF cycle design.

40|$|Integrated mapping in large-genome monocots {{has been}} carried out on a limited number of species. Furthermore, {{integrated}} maps are difficult to construct for these species due to, among other reasons, the specific plant populations needed. To fill these gaps, Alliums were chosen as target species and a new strategy for constructing suitable populations was developed. This strategy involves the use of <b>trihybrid</b> genotypes in which only one homeolog of a chromosome pair is recombinant due to interspecific recombination. We used genotypes from a <b>trihybrid</b> Allium cepa × (A. roylei × A. fistulosum) population. Recombinant chromosomes 5 and 8 from the interspecific parent were analyzed using genomic in situ hybridization visualization of recombination points and the physical positions of recombination were integrated into AFLP linkage maps of both chromosomes. The integrated maps showed that in Alliums recombination predominantly occurs in the proximal half of chromosome arms and that 57. 9 % of PstI/MseI markers are located in close proximity to the centromeric region, suggesting the presence of genes in this region. These findings are different from data obtained on cereals, where recombination rate and gene density tends to be higher in distal regions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A central {{composite}} {{experimental design}} and multiple regression {{were used to}} model the production of pulp and paper sheets from a Paulownia fortunei × tormentosa × elongata <b>trihybrid</b> clone. Also, the same experiments were carried out with the solid phase after autohydrolysis of the raw material. RESULTS: The results were compared with those obtained from the solid phase remaining after autohydrolysis of the raw material {{with a view to}} optimizing the use of hemicelluloses and cellulose by fractionation. Pulp and paper sheets from the <b>trihybrid</b> clone surpass those from other Paulownia species such as P. fortunei and P. elongata in physical properties such as tensile index (11. 6 – 49. 1 Nmg− 1), burst index (0. 23 – 2. 41 MPam 2 kg− 1), tear index (0. 71 – 3. 03 mNm 2 g− 1) and intrinsic viscosity (427 – 958 cm 3 g− 1). CONCLUSIONS: The solid phase obtained by autohydrolysis of the Paulownia <b>trihybrid</b> provides pulp and paper sheets comparable in strength-related properties with those of pulp directly produced from the raw material, but using substantially milder operating conditions and with the added advantage that the autohydrolysis treatment provides highly valorizable liquor.

Throughout much of this history, workers {{interested}} in {{the origins of the}} Australians have often focused on scenarios that invoke multiple founding populations for the modern inhabitants of this continent.

40|$|Abstract To {{what extent}} can ethnic factors {{contribute}} to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in an urban Brazilian population? Conversely, how can environmental factors such as diet change these prevalences in a given ethnic group, in this case Brazilian Indians? To answer these questions estimates of ethnic admixture in Afro- and Euro-Brazilians from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were established using eight genetic systems and compared with the prevalences of these conditions obtained pre-viously. This information was integrated with results obtained inside and out-side of Brazil. The similarity of prevalences for type 2 diabetes and IGT in Afro- and Euro-Brazilians {{may be related to}} the extensive gene flow that oc-curred between them and to similar socioeconomic levels in the samples in-vestigated. On the other hand, changes in the traditional diet are probably conditioning the appearance of diabetes among Brazilian and other South American Indians.

40|$|The {{population}} of Costa Rica {{has been considered}} historically {{as the product of}} the amalgamation of three ethnic groups: Europeans, Africans and Amerindians. In addition, {{it has been said that}} this population is highly inbred, mainly in the central regions of the country. In order to analyze these aspects of historical origin and the constitution of Costa Rica population, we have been conducting a series of studies that aim to unravel the genetic structure of that population. The results show that the Costa Rican population is certainly <b>trihybrid,</b> similar to those of other countries in Latin America, but differing from them in the proportions of gene flow from the ancestral populations. We found that while some specific regions inside the Central Valley maintain a high average inbreeding coefficient, the general trend towards a temporary decline over time. The percentage of inbreeding (alpha) remains high, but in general is not correlated positively with the alpha value. That suggest the existence of moderate emigrations and more unions between couples with the same geographical origin, but not consanguineous unions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} gene flow on Hispanic populations from {{different}} geographic {{regions of the}} United States was analyzed using six autosomal DNA markers (LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D 7 S 8, GC, and HLA-DQA). By region of sampling, the Hispanic populations showed different ancestry contributions, from a <b>trihybrid</b> structure with European, Native American, and African contributions (California, Nevada, Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia) to a dihybrid structure with European and American contributions (Southwest population) or European and African contributions (Pennsylvania and Southeast population). These findings allowed us to define two regional groups, the West and the East. In the former, Native American contributions ranged from 35. 58 % to 57. 87 %; in the East region the values ranged from 0 % to 21. 27 %. An African influence was similar in both regions, ranging from 0 % to 17. 11 %, with a tendency of increasing in the East region.

It follows an apparentclassic <b>trihybrid</b> admixture model. To better understand the Comorian population admixture dynamics, we analyzed the contributions of these three historical parental components to its genetic pool. To enhance accuracy and reliability, we used both classical and molecular markers. Samples consist of published data: blood group frequencies, 14 KIR genes, 19 mitochondrial DNA SNPs (to highlight female migrations), 14 Y chromosome SNPs (male migrations). We revealed distinct admixture patterns for autosomal and uniparental markers. KIR gene frequencies had never been used to estimate admixture rates, this being a first assessment of their informative power in admixture studies. To avoid major methodological and statistical bias, we determined admixture coefficients through nine well-tried estimators and their associated software programs (ADMIX 95, ADMIX, admix 2. 0, LEA, LEADMIX, and Mistura). Results from mtDNA and Y chromosome markers point to an important sex-bias in the admixture event. The original Bantu gene pool received a predominant male-mediated contribution from the Arabian Peninsula and Persia, and a female-mediated contribution from Southeast Asia.

40|$|As the {{evolutionary}} significance of hybridization is largely dictated by its extent beyond the first generation, we broadly surveyed patterns of introgression across a sympatric zone of two native poplars (Populus balsamifera, Populus deltoides) in Quebec, Canada within which European exotic Populus nigra and its hybrids have been extensively planted since the 1800 s. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared fixed within each species {{were characterized by}} DNA-sequencing pools of pure individuals. Thirty-five of these diagnostic SNPs were employed in a high-throughput assay that genotyped 635 trees of different age classes, sampled from 15 sites with various degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. The degree of admixture within sampled trees was then assessed through Bayesian clustering of genotypes. Hybrids were present in seven of the populations, with 2. 4 % of all sampled trees showing spontaneous admixture. Sites with hybrids were significantly more disturbed than pure stands, while hybrids comprised both immature juveniles and trees of reproductive age. All three possible F 1 s were detected. Advanced-generation hybrids were consistently biased towards P. balsamifera regardless of whether hybridization had occurred with P. deltoides or P. nigra. Gene exchange between P. deltoides and P. nigra was not detected beyond the F 1 generation; however, detection of a <b>trihybrid</b> demonstrates that even this apparent reproductive isolation does not necessarily result in an evolutionary dead end. Collectively, results demonstrate the natural fertility of hybrid poplars and suggest that introduced genes could potentially affect the genetic integrity of native trees, similar to that arising from introgression between natives...|$|E
40|$|Ancestry {{informative}} markers (AIMs) are genetic loci {{with large}} frequency {{differences between the}} major ethnic groups and are very useful in admixture estimation. However, their frequencies are poorly known within South American indigenous populations, {{making it difficult to}} use them in admixture studies with Latin American populations, such as the <b>trihybrid</b> Brazilian population. To minimize this problem, the frequencies of the AIMs FY-null RB 2300, LPL, AT 3 - 1 / 1), Sb 19. 3, APO, and PV 92 were determined via PCR and PCR-RFLP in four tribes from Brazilian Amazon (Tikuna, Kashinawa, Baniwa, and Kanamari), to evaluate their potential for discriminating indigenous populations from Europeans and Africans, as well as discriminating each tribe from the others. Although capable of differentiating tribes, as evidenced by the exact test of population differentiation, a neighbor-joining tree suggests that the AIMs are useless in obtaining reliable reconstructions of the biological relationships and evolutionary history that characterize the villages and tribes studied. The mean allele frequencies from these AIMs were very similar to those observed for North American natives. They discriminated Amerindians from Africans, but not from Europeans. On the other hand, the neighbor-joining dendrogram separated Africans and Europeans from Amerindians with a high statistical support (bootstrap = 0. 989). The relatively low diversity (GST = 0. 042) among North American natives and Amerindians from Brazilian Amazon agrees with the lack of intra-ethnic variation previously reported for these markers.

Mestizos and Afro-Ecuadorans can be {{considered}} <b>trihybrid</b> populations containing genes originating in the Americas, Europe, and Africa, {{as is the case}} with equivalent populations in other Latin American countries. The proportion and the dynamics of the admixture process remain unknown. However, a certain sex asymmetry of the admixture process can be expected for historical reasons. We typed 11 Y-chromosome short tandem repeats (STRs) in these three ethnic groups to provide adequate allele and haplotype frequencies for forensic genetic purposes and to quantify admixture proportions in male lineages. In addition, a data set of 15 autosomal STRs in the same samples were reanalyzed for the same purpose. Contributions to Mestizo Y chromosomes were estimated to be 70 % European, 28 % Amerindian, and 2 % African, whereas in autosomes the contributions were 19 %, 73 %, and 8 %, respectively, which underlines the sexual asymmetry in mating, with Europeans contributing mostly males. European Y-chromosome haplotypes in Mestizos were similar to those in Spain. Moreover, about 10 % of European Y chromosomes were found in the Amerindian Kichwa. As for Afro- Ecuadorans, their contributions to the male line are 44 % African, 31 % European, and 15 % Native American; the last value is the highest percentage reported so far for an African-derived American group.

On continuing our research on new drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of multifunctional <b>trihybrid</b> agents. The design strategy {{was based on the}} incorporation of a benzothiazole (BTA) moiety on a series of very recently reported bihybrids, resulting from the conjugation of a tacrine (TAC) with natural based moieties, namely S-allylcysteine (SAC) (garlic constituent) and S-propargylcysteine (SPRC). Thus, in addition to the acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChEI) and anti-ROS capacity of the bihybrids (TAC-SAC/SPRC), the new trihybrids (TAC-SAC/SPRC-BTA) were endowed with 5 -fold capacity for inhibition of the amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ) aggregation. The BTA moiety led also to considerable enhancement of the AChEI on the trihybrids, which molecular modeling suggested to be due to the simultaneous binding to the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. The trihybrids were also assessed for the MAO inhibition, but resulted in lower activity than expected, ascribed to the low accessibility of the propargyl groups to the enzyme active site. Finally, the effects of the compounds on the viability of neuroblastome cells stressedwith Aβ 42 and H 2 O 2 showed moderate cell protection. Overall, the performed studies illustrate the importance (and limitations) of enclosing several molecular scaffolds in one molecular entity to allow the modulation of multiple AD targets.

40|$|The {{roots of}} the Hispanic populations of the Caribbean Islands and Central and South America go back to three continents of the Old World. In Puerto Rico major genetic {{contributions}} have come from (1) Asians {{in the form of}} the aboriginal Taino population, an Arawak tribe, present when Columbus arrived on the Island, (2) Europeans, largely Spanish explorers, settlers, government administrators, and soldiers, and (3) Africans who came as part of the slave trade. Since JC virus (JCV) genotypes characteristic of Asia, Europe, and Africa have been identified, and excretion of JCV in urine has been proposed as a marker for human migrations, we sought to characterize the JCV strains present in a Caribbean Hispanic population. We found that the strains of JCV present today in Puerto Rico are those derived from the Old World populations represented there: Types 1 B and 4 from Spain, Types 3 A, 3 B, and 6 from Africa, and Type 2 A from Asia. The Type 2 A genotype represents the indigenous Taino people. This JCV genotype was represented much more frequently (61 %) than would be predicted by the <b>trihybrid</b> model of genetic admixture. This might be attributable to characteristics of JCV Type 2 A itself, as well as to the nature of the early relationships between Spanish men and native women. These findings indicate that the JCV strains carried by the Taino Indians can be found in today’s Puerto Rican population despite the apparent demise of these people more than two centuries ago. Therefore, molecular characterization of JCV provides a tool to supplement genetic techniques for reconstructing population histories including admixed populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the process conditions of pulping of a <b>trihybrid</b> clone Paulownia on pulp properties in the soda-anthraquinone process has been investigated. A composite central experimental design and a multiple regression were used to find the relationship between independent process variables and pulp properties. The ash content (8. 9 g kg− 1) is lower and cellulose content (440 g kg− 1) is higher than those found for other species of Pauwlonia and other energetic crops. The elemental composition has a low content in S and N (2. 1 g kg− 1) in comparation with poplar or willow. With a gross heating value of 20. 3 MJ kg− 1. This is somewhat higher than those for hardwood, slightly higher than those for Pinus pinaster and softwood, and much higher than those for residues of food plants and agricultural crops. This supports {{the use of the}} genus Paulownia as an energy crop. Fiber length (0. 97 mm) is similar to hardwoods and suitable physical characteristics of paper sheets (tensile index) and acceptable chemical characteristics and yield pulping could be obtained by operating at low-intermediate temperature (163 – 171 °C) and alkali concentration (200 g kg− 1) and high or medium values for operation time (120 – 150 min). The pulp obtained at these conditions has suitable chemical (pulp) and physical (paper sheets) characteristics: yield (470 g kg− 1), ethanol-benzene extractives (22. 2 g kg− 1), holocellulose contents (960 g kg− 1), α-cellulose contents (758 g kg− 1), lignin contents (82. 8 g kg− 1), Shopper–Riegler degree (23. 2 °SR), and tensile index (36. 0 kN m kg− 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Before the Mendelian {{methods of}} {{analysis}} became available, considerable wonder would doubtless have been excited by the 2 ̆ 2 mysterious 2 ̆ 2 appearance in F 2 of one colored grain-purple or red-to every five or six white ones {{in case of a}} maize cross, both parents and F, of which had only white grains. An occurrence of this sort has recently been noted in one of my maize cultures and the F 2 numbers are explained here as a <b>trihybrid</b> or tetrahybrid ratio. The crosses in question were made primarily for a study of size inheritance and fairly large numbers have been grown. The varieties concerned are two dwarfs of distinctly different types, Tom Thumb pop and California Rice pop, and a tall type Missouri dent. The facts with reference to aleurone color are these: Tom Thumb pop, a 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 corn (i. e., having non-colored aleurone), was crossed with Missouri dent, also a white corn. Three generations of hybrid plants four generations for aleurone and other endosperm characters- have been grown without the appearance of any but white grains. The same white-seeded Missouri dent was also crossed with the white-seeded California pop. The three hybrid generations grown to date have shown no aleurone color. Furthermore, when the same white Tom Thumb pop was crossed with the same white California pop, only white grains appeared in F,. But both of the two ears containing F 2 seeds-the only ones that have been produced as yet-had a sprinkling of both purple and red grains, too many to be explained as due to care- less guarding against foreign pollen and too few to be accounted for by any simple monohybrid or dihybrid formul...|$|E
40|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that the Portuguese brought the African moved into the interior regions {{of the state of}} Karnataka, India, and have remained there ever since. Over time the Siddis have experienced considerable cultural changes because of their proximity to neighboring population groups. To understand the biological consequences of these changes, we studied the Siddis {{to determine the extent of}} genetic variation and the contributions from the African, European, and Indian ancestral populations. In the present study we typed the Siddis for 20 polymorphic serological, red cell, and Alu insertion-deletion loci. The overall pattern of phenotype (and genotype) distribution is in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Considering the ethnohistorical records and the availability of secondary-source genetic data, we used two data sets in the analysis: one comprising eight serological and red cell enzyme markers with eight population groups and another comprising six Alu insertion-deletion markers with seven tribal groups of South India. The dendrograms generated from these two data sets on the basis of genetic distance analysis between the selected populations of African, European, and Indian descent reveals that the Siddis are closer to the Africans than they are to the South Indian populations. Genetic admixture analysis using a dihybri model (19 loci) and a <b>trihybrid</b> model (10 loci and 8 loci) shows that the predominant influence comes from the Africans, a lesser contribution from the South Indians, and a slight contribution from the Portuguese. Thus the original composition of the African genes among the Siddis has been diluted to some extent by the contribution from southern Indian population groups. There is no nonrandom association of alleles among a set of 10 genetic marker system considered in the present study. The demonstration of genetic homogeneity of the Siddis, despite their admixed origin, suggests the utility of this population for genetic and epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|Estimating the {{proportions}} of different ancestries in admixed populations {{is very important in}} population genetics studies, and it is particularly important for detecting population substructure effects in case-control association studies. In this work, a set of 48 ancestry, informative insertion, deletion polymorphisms (INDELs) were selected with the goal of efficiently measuring {{the proportions}} of three different ancestries (sub-Saharan African, European, and Native American) in mixed populations. All selected markers can be easily analyzed via multiplex PCR and detected with standard capillary electrophoresis. A total of 593 unrelated individuals representative of European, African, and Native American parental populations were typed, as were 380 individuals from three Brazilian populations with known admixture patterns. As expected, the interethnic admixture estimates show that individuals from southern Brazil present an almost exclusively European ancestry; Afro-descendant communities in the Amazon region, apart from the major African contribution, present some degree of admixture with Europeans and Native Americans; and a sample from Belem, in the northeastern Amazon, shows a significant contribution of the three ethnic groups, although with a greater European proportion. In summary, a panel of ancestry-informative INDELs was optimized and proven to be a variable tool for estimating individual and global ancestry proportions in admixed populations. The ability to accurately infer interethnic admixtures highlights the usefulness of this marker set for assessing population substructure in association studies, particularly those conducted in Brazilian and other Latin American populations sharing <b>trihybrid</b> ancestry patterns.

Asthma has a higher prevalence and is more severe in populations with a high African component. Association of African ancestry with asthma has been demonstrated. We estimated admixture proportions of samples from six <b>trihybrid</b> populations of African descent and determined the relationship between African ancestry and asthma and total serum IgE levels (tIgE). We genotyped 237 ancestry informative markers in asthmatics and nonasthmatic controls from Barbados (190 / 277), Jamaica (177 / 529), Brazil (40 / 220), Colombia (508 / 625), African Americans from New York (207 / 171), and African Americans from Baltimore/Washington, D. C. (625 / 757). We estimated individual ancestries and evaluated genetic stratification using Structure and principal component analysis. Association of African ancestry and asthma and tIgE was evaluated by regression analysis. Mean ± SD African ancestry ranged from 0. 76 ± 0. 10 among Barbadians to 0. 33 ± 0. 13 in Colombians. The European component varied from 0. 14 ± 0. 05 among Jamaicans and Barbadians to 0. 26 ± 0. 08 among Colombians. African ancestry was associated with risk for asthma in Colombians (odds ratio (OR) = 4. 5, P = 0. 001) Brazilians (OR = 136. 5, P = 0. 003), and African Americans of New York (OR: 4. 7; P = 0. 040). African ancestry was also associated with higher tIgE levels among Colombians (β = 1. 3, P = 0. 04), Barbadians (β = 3. 8, P = 0. 03), and Brazilians (β = 1. 6, P = 0. 03). Our findings indicate that African ancestry can account for, at least in part, the association between asthma and its associated trait, tIgE levels...|$|E
40|$|CYP 2 D 6 {{differences}} {{have already been}} demonstrated within Latin American populations by the CEIBA. FP Consortium of the Ibero-American Network of Pharmacogenetics (RIBEF, as per the acronym in Spanish). However, within the population of Costa Rica, no {{research has been conducted}} until now, even though this population has a <b>trihybrid</b> component ancestry that represents an interesting condition. Thus, the present study was aimed to determine the frequency of Ultra-rapid Metabolizers (UMs) and Poor Metabolizers (PMs) in a Costa Rican population, as well as to determine whether there are differences in the CYP 2 D 6 -predicted phenotype frequencies among three Costa Rican groups with different ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, these frequencies of PMs and UMs obtained were compared with Ibero-American populations published data. Finally, we also aimed to describe allele frequencies among different Costa Rican ethnic groups. This research has been undertaken {{within the framework of the}} RIBEF CEIBA Consortium studies on Latin American populations. A total of 385 individuals were included in the study: 139 mestizos, 197 Amerindians, and 49 Afro-Caribbeans. CYP 2 D 6 genotypes were determined by XL-PCR and Real-Time PCR. The CYP 2 D 6 variant alleles * 2, * 3, * 4, * 5, * 6, * 10, * 17, * 29, * 35 and * 41 were also determined. For the entire Costa Rican population, the frequency of PMs and UMs was 6 % and 6. 5 %, respectively. The percentage of UMs in the mestizo population was higher than in the Amerindian population. CYP 2 D 6 UMs vary from 3. 6 % to 10. 1 % and PMs from 1. 4 % to 10. 2 % among three Costa Rican groups. The highest frequencies of UMs (10. 1 %) and PMs (10. 2 %) were found in the mestizo and Amerindian populations, respectively. In conclusion, the frequencies of UMs and PMs for CYP 2 D 6 varied widely across the mestizo, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean Costa Rican populations. Future research in this population should be oriented to identify new CYP 2 D 6 variants through sequencing methods, as well as to determine CYP 2 D 6 phenotype, in order to establish the phenotype-genotype relation. Finally, further studies involving genetic markers of ancestry are needed in the Costa Rican population...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the hoof of cattle play's an important role when cattle are used as work animal. The fundamental research on hoof, however, has not been performed extensively, {{so far as the}} author is aware. The author has carried out studies on the hoof quality for the purpose of improving the utilization capacity of draft and work cattle. In testing the resisting power of hoof to the load, tensile test (Plate 9, 19) as well as abrasion test (Plate 9, 20) were employed, and four breeds of Japanese cattle, namely, Japanese Black Breed, Japanese Brown Breed, Misima Cattle (Japanese Native Cattle) and Japanese Polled Breed were used. It was found that the hardness of hoof quality had varieties, and also had a close relation to the structure of the tissue of hoof. Though the properties of horn-tubea in the horny capsule of hoof seems to correlate with the physical properties as hardness and resilience of it, there is no experimental proof. The present studies are the results obtained from careful observations on the various aspects of hoof quality with special reference to the horn-tubes. (1) The horn-tubes exist in the middle layer of hoof's wall and in the sole of hoof. The middle layer of hoof is divided into three equal parts, i. e., a, b and c. The part a is innermost and the part c is outermost (Fig. 1). The resurts of observation of the horn-tubes are summarize! as follows: (a) Toe: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and the horn-tubes which are located near to part b are larger than those which are located apart from it. It shows that both central cells of horn-tubes and horn-tube cells of part a are young and soft (Platc 6. 1 & 2). The horn-tubes of part b are round or oval in shape and large in size. The horn-tube cells develop fully and their central cells are vacuolated(Plate 6, 3 & 4). The horn-tubes of part c are long ellipse in shape, the horn-tube cells and central cells degenerate at the region near to outer layer of wall (Plate fi, 5 & 6). (b) Side wall: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and small in size, the horn-tube cells in the region near to horn lamina are young and soft (Plate 7, 7). The horn-tubes of part b are round in shape and medium in size, they are in full growth but they are smaller than those in the toe(Plate 7, 8). The horn-tubes of part c are oval in shape and degenerate in the region near to outer layer of wall. (c) Quarters: the horn-tubes of part a are seen to be immature and soft (Plate 7, 9). The horn-tubes of partb are round in shape and develop fully, but the central cells are not vacuolated(Plate 7, 10). The horn-tubes of part c are not so small as the horn-tubes in the region near to the outer layer of wall (Plate 7, 11). (d) Inner wall: the horn-tubes of part a are oval in shape and are seen to be active(Plate 7, 12). The horn-tubes of part b are oval in shape and develop fully, some of their central cells are vacuolated(Plate 8. 13 & 16). The horn-tubes of part c do not degenerate so much as the the horn-tubes in the region near to the outer layer of wall, and their central cells do not degenerate and are seen to be active (Plate 8, 14 & 15). (e) Sole of wall: the horn-tubes are round in shape and soft, they are not seen distinctly (Plate 8, 17). (2) The horn-tubes in the hoof wall have close relation with the hardness of the hoof, that is, the resilient hoof has large horn-tubes and large horn-tube cells, as well (Plate 10, 25). The less resilient hoof has smaller horn-tubes and smaller central cells, these central cells are not active (Plate 9, 23). From the fact that there can be oberved, under microscope, many horn-tubes in the hard hoof as shown in Plate 9, 21 which shows a transverse section of hoof, the magnitude being × 100, the hardness of the hoof quality can be determined by number of horn-tubes. (3) From the results of observations in the Misima Cattle and the Japanese Polled Breed, it was considered that the number of horn-tubes was determined by quantitative hereditary factors. The authour presumably concludes that 3 incomplete dominant facters (A_ 1 A_ 2 A_ 3) concern with the number of horn-tubes. Heterozygous Fj is assumed as A_ 1 a_ 1 A_ 2 a_ 2 A_ 8 a_ 8 in its genetic constitution and Fo shows as if the segregation of <b>trihybrid</b> (Figs. 4 ～ 6). (4) The growth of calves accompanies with the growth of horn-tubes, that is, as the calves become bigger the hoof grows to become larger and the horn-tubes also attain their larger size. It is about 18 months of age when the horn-tubes attain their full growth (Plate 12, 37 ～ 42). (5) The characteristics of hoof are influenced by not only heredity but also environment. The horn-tubes of cattle in Karst-district are hard and the angle of horn-tube is large, on the other hand, the horn-tubes of cattle kept in the stall to be, fattened are swollen and soft, and the angle of horn-tube is small. (6) The differences of characteristics of hoof among various breeds were examined: (a) The horn-tubes of Holstein-Friesian Cattle are softer than that of the Japanese Breed of Cattle (Plate 14. 53 & 54). (b) The horn-tubet of the Misima Cattle resemble to those of the Japanese Black Breed, but the horn-tubes of the former are a little finer than those of the latter (Plate 14, 49). (c) The horn-tubes of the Japanese Brown Breed are larger and softer than those of the Japanese Black Breed (Plate 14, 51). (d) The horn-tubes of the Japanese Polled Breed are quite {{similar to those of the}} Japanese Brown Breed (Plate 14, 52). (7) When the hoof is oild the abrasion of hoof becomes slight, and this is due to the fact that the oil protects it from the abrasion and promotes the resiliency, permeating into tissue of hoof, especially into horn-tubes. At the beginning of the labor in the puddy field, the abrasion of the hoof is very slow, but the abrasion of the hoof gradu- ally increases as the labor-hour is prolonged. When cattle are loaded with heavy goods on their back, the abrasion of hoof occurs strrnger than when non-loaded, hut the difference between them is rather insignificant (Figs. 1 O～ 11) ...|$|E
