25|$|Hantaviruses are Bunyaviruses. The Bunyaviridae {{family is}} divided into five genera: Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, <b>Tospovirus,</b> and Hantavirus. Like all members of this family, hantaviruses have genomes {{comprising}} three negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments, and so are classified as negative sense RNA viruses. Members of other Bunyaviridae family genera are generally arthropod-borne viruses, but hantaviruses {{are thought to be}} transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta or rodent bites.|$|E

50|$|A {{large number}} of plant {{families}} {{are known to be}} affected by viruses of the <b>Tospovirus</b> genus. These include both food crops (such as peanuts, watermelons, capsicums, tomatoes, zucchinis, et al.) as well as ornamental species which are important to flower farms (calla lily, impatiens, chrysanthemums, iris, et al.).

50|$|<b>Tospoviruses</b> are arboviruses usually {{vectored}} by thrips.

40|$|Summary. The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} (4838 nucleotides) of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) M RNA indicates, typical for <b>tospoviruses,</b> {{the presence of}} two genes in ambisense arrangement. The vRNA ORF codes for the potential cell-to-cell movement (NSm) protein (34. 8 kDa) and the vcRNA ORF for the viral glycoprotein (G 1 /G 2) precursor (128. 6 kDa). Multiple sequence alignment of the NSm and G 1 /G 2 precursor proteins of IYSV {{with those of other}} <b>tospoviruses,</b> showed highest homologies to Peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV) and Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMV). The potential cell-to-cell movement protein of <b>tospoviruses</b> is highly conserved (40 - 70 ␒dentity), {{with the exception of the}} first 60 N terminal amino acids, a domain that clearly diverged. For the G 1 and G 2 viral glycoproteins, blast searches revealed a significant homology between the C-terminally located tospoviral G 1 (G(C)) protein with the counterpart of the animal-infecting bunyaviruses, suggesting a functional homology for these proteins...|$|R
50|$|Infection {{with the}} virus results in {{spotting}} and wilting of the plant, reduced vegetative output, and eventually death. No antiviral cures {{have been developed for}} plants infected with a <b>Tospovirus,</b> and infected plants should be removed from a field and destroyed in order {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease.|$|E
50|$|Presently the soybean thrips (Neohydatothrips variabilis) is {{the only}} known vector of SVNV. Research {{needs to be done}} to verify if this {{is the only}} thrips species capable of {{transmitting}} this new and widespread virus. This virus is believed to have a transmission cycle similar to other members of the <b>Tospovirus</b> genus. In the type member of the <b>Tospovirus</b> genus (TSWV), acquisition of the virus by the thrips vector can only occur during the larval stage of development by the thrips. From the larval stage the virus is passed transstadially to the adult stage. Adult thrips are then able via feeding to transmit the virus to the plant host. It is important to keep in mind with this pathogen, as with all vectored pathogens, that behavior of the vector can contribute to the potential spread of the disease.|$|E
50|$|The L and M segment are {{negative}} sense. For the Genera of Phlebovirus and <b>Tospovirus,</b> the S segment is ambisense.

40|$|A plant {{viral vector}} {{engineered}} from an in vivo infectious clone of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) {{was used to}} express the nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) of <b>tospoviruses</b> in planta. The open reading frames (ORFs) of NPs of different serogroups of <b>tospoviruses,</b> including Tomato spotted wilt virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Watermelon silver mottle virus, Peanut bud necrosis virus, and Watermelon bud necrosis virus (WBNV), were in frame inserted in between the P 1 and HC-Pro genes of the ZYMV vector. Six histidine residues and an NIa protease cleavage site were added at the C-terminal region of the inserts to facilitate purification and process of free form of the expressed NPs, respectively. Approximately 1. 2 - 2. 5 mg/NPs 100 g tissues were purified from leaf extracts of zucchini squash. The expressed WBNV NP {{was used as an}} immunogen for the production of highly specific polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The procedure provides a convenient and fast way for production of large quantities of pure NPs of <b>tospoviruses</b> in planta.

40|$|Background Localization and {{interaction}} studies of viral proteins provide important {{information about their}} replication in their host plants. <b>Tospoviruses</b> (Family Bunyaviridae) are economically important viruses affecting numerous field and horticultural crops.

We studied the in vivo localization {{and interaction}} pat-terns of the IYSV proteins in uninfected and infected Nicotiana benthamiana and identified the interacting partners. Principal Findings Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis demonstrated homotypic and heterotypic interactions between IYSV nucleocapsid (N) and movement (NSm) proteins. These interactions were further confirmed by pull-down assays. Additionally, interacting re-gions of IYSV N and NSm were identified by the yeast- 2 -hybrid system and β-galactosidase assay.

50|$|The genome of SVNV is a {{negative}} sense single stranded RNA virus (Group V) that has three segments (S, M, and L segments). The L segment is 9010 nt and encodes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The M segment is 4955 nt and to encode for NSm and GN/GC proteins. The S segment is 2603 nt and encodes the N and NSs proteins. This virus codes proteins from the M and S segments in an ambisense manner, meaning that proteins are translated from {{both positive and negative}} sense RNA. There is preliminary evidence to suggest low diversity within SVNV. These proteins occur in all members of the <b>Tospovirus</b> genus, and likely serve similar functions within SVNV as they do for the type member of the <b>Tospovirus</b> genus (TSWV). The RdRp aids in replication and transcription of the RNA. The NSm protein is a non-structural protein (not present in mature virion) and is critical to cell-to-cell movement within plant cells (8). The NSs protein is also a non-structural protein and contributes to suppression of RNA silencing during plant infection. Glycoproteins (GN/GC) are necessary for successful thrips transmission. The N protein contributes to viral replication, and coats the genomic RNA within the virion.|$|E

TBSV was first discovered in 1935 in tomatoes and results in plants with stunted growth and deformed fruits. TSWV was discovered in tomatoes in Australia in 1915, and for many years was the only member of what is now known as genus <b>Tospovirus,</b> family Bunyaviridae.|$|E
50|$|The tospoviruses are a genus (<b>Tospovirus)</b> of {{negative}} RNA virus {{found within the}} family Bunyaviridae.

40|$|A {{panel of}} {{recombinant}} single-chain antibodies (scFvs) against structural proteins of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) was retrieved {{from a human}} combinatorial scFv antibody library using the novel phage display technique. After subcloning the encoding DNA sequences in the expression vector pSKAP/S, which allowed the scFvs to be expressed as alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins, 17 different scFv antibodies were obtained. Of these, 12 scFvs were directed against the nucleoprotein (N) and 5, putatively, against the glycoproteins (G 1 and G 2). Five of the N-specific antibodies cross-reacted with two other <b>tospoviruses</b> (Tomato chlorotic spot virus and Groundnut ringspot virus), but none recognized the more distantly related <b>tospoviruses</b> Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Watermelon silverleaf mottle virus, Iris yellow spot virus, or Physalis severe mottle virus.

With other <b>tospoviruses,</b> sequence identity was {{in the range of}} 81 - 83 % with Tomato chlorotic spot virus and Chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus and, 74 - 79 % with Groundnut ring spot virus, Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus and Impatiens necrotic spot virus, 53 - 55 % with Iris yellow spot virus, Peanut bud necrosis virus and Watermelon silver mottle virus. The phylogenetic tree showed three primary branches departing from the bulk of all NSM sequences; all the TSWV sequences clustered in two subgroups, denoted A-like and D-like, clearly distinct from the other <b>tospoviruses.</b> The inclusion in a group of any of the Apulian isolates of TSWV was apparently not determined by the year, the place or the host from which they were recovered.
