5|$|Sir Arthur Keith in 1948 {{developed}} the Amity-enmity complex. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> protect {{members of the}} in-group, and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any out-group.|$|E
5|$|Today, erosion {{caused by}} ship {{movements}} {{on the nearby}} Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in a poor state, particularly at its excavated western end.

5|$|In From Dust, players {{assume a}} god-like, first-person {{perspective}} {{from which they}} manipulate an archipelago environment in an effort <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> enlighten a nomadic tribe and help them to seek their lost knowledge. With a spherical cursor, the user controls certain types of matter in real time. Lava cools to form solid rock, vegetation propagates in soil and spreads naturally once a village is built, and moving water quickly erodes the terrain. Physical changes to the world occur extremely rapidly, allowing players to restructure islands within minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{band of the}} Great Eastern Railway, {{augmented}} by drummers from the Royal Marines, played the Dead March. Eternal Father, Strong <b>to</b> <b>Save</b> <b>and</b> Abide with Me were sung, and a blessing given by the Bishop of London. The route of the coffin to Liverpool Street station was lined with people. Fryatt was buried at All Saints' Church, Upper Dovercourt. His coffin was carried from the station to the church on a gun carriage. His widow was presented with the insignia of the Belgian Order of Leopold that had been posthumously awarded to Fryatt. Fryatt was also posthumously awarded the Belgian Maritime War Cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are no longer able <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E
25|$|MMT economists aim to run deficits {{as much as}} {{the private}} sector wants <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>and</b> for real {{resources}} to be fully used e.g. full employment. As most private sectors want to net save and globally, external balances must add up to zero, MMT economists usually advocate budget deficits.|$|E
