30|$|Once captured, {{the fish}} must be handled {{as gently as}} possible, {{ensuring}} minimal contact with the skin. Scombrids lack the protection of large scales, and {{have a tendency to}} shed their scales when captured, which makes them more vulnerable to skin infections. When bracing the fish, for example, when heavy fish must be lifted to the boat, or when transferring the fish from the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> to the holding tank, it is often necessary to use PVC or vinyl slings covered with water based lubricant, which have shown to be effective and less harmful than nets or bare hands (Takashi 2014). Single barbless hooks are often used to facilitate fast hook removal. Releasing the hook is then performed using long nose pliers, a hook remover, or simply by placing the fish in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> with no tension on the line, so the fish will un-hook itself.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{relatively}} safe, compact, efficient recharging of a high-pressure room-temperature gas supply has been proposed. In this method, the gas would be liquefied {{at the source}} for transport as a cryogenic fluid at or slightly above atmospheric pressure. Upon reaching the destination, a simple heating/expansion process {{would be used to}} (1) convert the transported cryogenic fluid to the room-temperature, high-pressure gaseous form in which it is intended to be utilized and (2) transfer the resulting gas to the storage tank of the system to be recharged. In conventional practice for recharging high-pressure-gas systems, gases are transported at room temperature in high-pressure tanks. For recharging a given system to a specified pressure, a <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> must contain the recharge gas at a much higher pressure. At the destination, the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> is connected to the system storage tank to be recharged, and the pressures in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> and the system storage tank are allowed to equalize. One major disadvantage of the conventional approach is that the high transport pressure poses a hazard. Another disadvantage is the waste of a significant amount of recharge gas. Because the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> is disconnected from the system storage tank when it is at the specified system recharge pressure, the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> still contains a significant amount of recharge gas (typically on the order of half of the amount transported) that cannot be used. In the proposed method, the cryogenic fluid would be transported in a suitably thermally insulated tank that would be capable of withstanding the recharge pressure of the destination tank. The tank would be equipped with quick-disconnect fluid-transfer fittings and with a low-power electric heater (which would not be used during transport). In preparation for transport, a relief valve would be attached via one of the quick-disconnect fittings (see figure). During transport, the interior of the tank would be kept at a near-ambient pressure far below the recharge pressure. As leakage of heat into the tank caused vaporization of the cryogenic fluid, the resulting gas would be vented through the relief valve, which would be set to maintain the pressure in the tank at the transport value. Inasmuch as the density of a cryogenic fluid at atmospheric pressure greatly exceeds that of the corresponding gas in a practical high-pressure tank at room temperature, a tank for transporting a given mass of gas according to the proposed method could be smaller (and, hence, less massive) than is a tank needed for transporting the same mass of gas according to the conventional method...|$|E

30|$|Once {{transferred}} to the holding facility, fish face major challenges to recover from capture, handling and transport related stress and injury, such as skin abrasion, hook injuries and head collision in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> walls.

To assist with recovery, the fish are usually treated upon arrival with antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections, which are more likely to occur given the fish’s compromised physical condition.

30|$|Additional {{measures}} {{could be}} taken to improve the fish survival, by maintaining low stress levels during transport. This can be achieved either by improving water quality parameters, providing oxygen and removing or neutralizing wastes, or by slowing down the fish metabolism, thereby reducing stress and reducing oxygen intake rate, wastes excretion and water acidification. Some possible methods to improve water quality parameters of the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> include the addition of ammonia quenchers, coupled with buffering agents to keep a stable pH and thus maintain low ammonia build-up (Correia et al. 2011). Others have suggested the use of immersion anaesthetics sedatives or cooling of the tank water by 5 – 10  °C as measures to slow down metabolic rates of the transported fish (Berka 1986; Rimmer and Franklin 1997; Harmon 2009). These practices however, are more applicable to closed and semi-enclosed transport tanks, which recirculates and reuse the treated water. These methods cannot {{be used in the}} case of tuna tubes, because of the high rate flow-through system they incorporate, meaning that any additives or modifiers introduced to the water will be diluted immediately.|$|E
30|$|Currently {{accepted}} {{methods for}} capture of live Scombrids focus mainly on rod and line fishing of individual fish. Once hooked, {{the fish are}} placed in round cornered transport tanks, which hold aerated seawater. The fish are then transferred to the holding tank at the research facility (Bourke et al. 1987; Sepulveda and Dickson 2000; Wexler et al. 2003). The use of commercial fishing vessels, capable of holding large transport tanks (larger than 5000  L), permits holding of greater numbers of fish (10 – 20, average size of fish 1.8  kg), for longer periods (up to 6  h), without causing stress and damage due to deteriorating water quality (Bourke et al. 1987). Alternatively, though small scale capture and transport of live yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{was reported to be}} more time consuming than using larger vessels and seine nets, it allowed careful handling of each individual fish, which resulted in up to 50  % of the fish surviving capture, handling and transport, and up to 30  % of them were healthy enough to become broodstock (Wexler et al. 2003). Reducing the time spent in the <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> is crucial for the survival of the fish, especially when using small and medium volume transport tanks (Margulies et al. 2007).|$|E

According to the following conducted experiments, the milk was divided into two standard and non-standard groups. Then, effect of risk factors on making the samples non-standard was studied. Risk factors such as type of milk delivery unit, distance of cattle farm from plant, size of herd, education level of stockbreeders, capacity of milk <b>transport</b> <b>tank,</b> capacity of cooler device, and number of workers employed in cattle farms were evaluated in this study. Microbial and chemical evaluations were performed. Beta-lactam antibiotic residues and somatic cell count were specified.

After collecting the data, logistic regression model was used. According to the obtained results and comparison with Iran’s national standard, 26 out of 109 samples were determined to be at standard level and 83 ones had at least one out-of-standard factor. The results obtained from the model demonstrated significant effect of education of stockbreeders and capacity of cooler devices on the milk quality.

The results in three seasons were compared to those obtained at finishing of milking in the season before. The microbiological load of milk was observed using the bacteriological methods for determination of the presence of Staphylococcus sp. and other bacteria, and determination {{of the total number of}} staphylococci: a)   in milliliter of pool milk sample; b)   the transport control – smears from <b>transport</b> <b>tank</b> and determination of the total number of staphylococci in the tank milk sample; c) bacteriological examination of bulk tank milk in the dairy plant before and after pasteurisation, including examination of cheese curd.

Out of 112 strains of Staphylococcus aureus only four strain produced staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), but in another 7 strains a gene for production of SE, type C was found. The measures introduced during the following season led to the fact that total numbers of coagulase-positive staphylococci in milk within the process of primary production and transport did not exceed the limit permitted by legislation, and after pasteurisation of milk and cheese curd they were not found at all.     doi: 10. 5219 / 58 </div...|$|E
40|$|The Southern {{bluefin tuna}} (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) {{is one of}} Australia’s most {{valuable}} aquaculture species, with total production valued at $ 153 million in 2012 / 2013. The aquaculture of SBT is currently based solely on capture of wild fish and as such, it is limited by fishing regulations quotas and seasonal variation in the fish availability. In order to provide sustainable, unlimited supply of SBT, novel and innovative methods are needed to successfully breed it in captivity, despite size and late maturation age limitations. Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative technology {{for the production of}} inter-species surrogates, capable of revolutionizing the aquaculture industry by facilitating easy handling, shorter generation time and a more economical management of large bodied broodstock, such as the SBT. This study aimed at developing the specific methods, molecular tools and knowledge to establish SBT surrogates for the SBT. Yellowtail kingfish (YTK, Seriola lalandi), was assessed as a potential surrogate host for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to produce SBT donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. In order to achieve this objective, germ cell populations were described in testis of donor SBT males using basic histology and the molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of SBT testis was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable type A spermatogonia (ASG). Percoll-enriched SBT testicular germ cells preparations were then transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 7 - 9 days post hatch YTK larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have detected presence of SBT cells in the gonads of the transplanted YTK fingerlings at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days post transplantation (dpt), indicating that the transplanted cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonized the developing gonad. However, further PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of YTK gonads at 165 dpt and PCR analysis of semen collected from sexually mature transplanted YTK males at 1. 5 years post transplantation, were not able to detect SBT germ cell-derived DNA or RNA, suggesting that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts’ gonads. This study demonstrates that YTK larvae can support migration and colonization of transplanted SBT spermatogonial cells, despite the phylogenetic distance between the two species. Other species from the Scombridae family (which are phylogenetically closer to SBT) were considered as potential surrogate hosts for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to increase the chances of successful development of the transplanted cells. A method for capture and transport of live pelagic Scombrid fish using “tuna tubes” was developed and optimized. Eight mediumsized mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis, also known as eastern little tuna or kawakawa) and leaping bonito (Cybiosarda elegans) were captured and transported alive to the holding tank at the Bribie Island Research Centre (BIRC), 3 of them acclimatized to the tank conditions. Twenty-eight additional small-sized blue mackerels (Scomber australasicus) were captured and transported alive to BIRC, using a 300 L rectangular <b>transport</b> <b>tank,</b> and were treated to induce spawning. None of the captured fish spawned in captivity, but the methods and equipment that were developed and optimized, proved useful for small-scale capture and transport of live Scombrids, as a preliminary step {{for the establishment of a}} potential surrogate host broodstock for the SBT. Key genes involved in the reproductive molecular pathway and specifically, germ cell development in the gonads, were described using transcriptome analysis of male and female SBT gonad cells, acquired by next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of transcripts from ovary and testis cells were compared, as well as Percoll-enriched cell preparations (as used in GCT) to crude testis cells. ASG-specific genes were identified for the first time in SBT, and were used to develop molecular markers to allow specific identification and localization of different germ cell populations in SBT gonads. These SBT germ cell-specific molecular probes were used to distinguish between transplanted SBT germ cells and the YTK host endogenous cells in a GCT experiment. The methods, experience, tools and knowledge acquired in this study present for the first time the exciting possibility of GCT to produce inter-species surrogates for the SBT. The tools established in this research will enable the Australian aquaculture industry to continue and pursue surrogate technology for the SBT, as well as to other hard-to-breed, large and late-maturing highvalued species.
