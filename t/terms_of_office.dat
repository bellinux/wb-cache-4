Of these, the most important are the powers to announce, convene and chair the National Assembly sessions, to interpret the constitution, laws and ordinances, and to issue ordinances on those matters assigned by the National Assembly. It supervises and guides the People's Councils and their activities, and directs, regulates and coordinates {{the activities of the}} Ethnic Council and the committees of the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by an office-seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but Congress declined to act on it right away. Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the lame duck session were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's length of service. Sherman {{voted in favor of}} Pendleton's bill, and the Senate approved it 38–5. The House concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16, 1883.|$|E

50|$|The {{term was}} {{introduced}} after {{the creation of}} the post of the President of Russia.

After creating the new Constitution <b>of</b> Russia, the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> the President, and therefore the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> the Prime Minister, was shortened to 4 years.

5|$|Heliade {{progressively}} distanced {{himself from}} the more radical groups, especially after discussions began {{on the issue of}} land reform and the disestablishment of the boyar class. Initially, he accepted the reforms, and, after the matter was debated within Frăţia just before rebellion broke out, he issued a resolution acknowledging this (the document was probably inspired by Nicolae Bălcescu). The compromise also set other goals, including national independence, responsible government, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, five-year <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> for Princes (and their election by the National Assembly), freedom of the press, and decentralization. On June 21, 1848, present in Islaz alongside Tell and the Orthodox priest known as Popa Şapcă, he read out these goals to a cheering crowd, in what was to be the effective start of the uprising (see Proclamation of Islaz). Four days after the Islaz events, the revolution succeeded in toppling Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government which immediately attracted Russian hostility. Presided over by Metropolitan Neofit, it included Heliade, who was also Minister of Education, as well as Tell, Ştefan Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, and, for a short while, the Bucharest merchant Gheorghe Scurti.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of {{government}} (Plan 12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E
5|$|West Bengal {{is governed}} through a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers {{such as the}} Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor {{is the head of}} state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. <b>Terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term.

5|$|When the MCC {{abolished}} amateur {{status in}} cricket in 1963, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change. In 1963, {{he was appointed}} as MCC President. When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he {{was appointed to the}} influential role of MCC Treasurer, a position he filled until 1976. During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968. He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new Test and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC, and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.|$|E
