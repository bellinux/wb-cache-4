In Rome he {{obtained}} the Licentiate of Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute and the Doctorate of Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University (1963).His studies focused on The Formulas of the Deuteronomic Creed (dissertation, Brill, Leiden 1963).

40|$|One of the cruxes of Walter Benjamin’s work is {{the tension}} between an indebting and an expiating "memoria", i. e. the afflicting and <b>the</b> <b>salvific</b> insistence of <b>history</b> within the present moment. On the one hand, memory inscribes itself onto spaces and bodies in the violent and painful fashion of Kafka's "Penal Colony" apparatus. On the other hand, it can, {{in the form of}} rememoration ('Eingedenken'), sublate these very inscriptions. This sublation usually {{involves}} some form of redemptive, timely (re-) verbalization, but Benjamin’s conception of it varies. To gain a better insight into this inherent, varying tension, the article will {{take a closer look at}} the connection between pain, memory and law-positing violence in some Benjaminian texts, occasionally relating them to the historical background of his discussion...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to show the overarching significance of the conquering motif in relation to discourse dynamics of the entire book of Revelation and <b>the</b> significance of <b>salvific</b> <b>history</b> for its syntagmatic understanding. Based on language-in-use as a whole between the model author and the model audience, syntagmatic analysis (i. e., SVU analysis) and associative analysis (i. e., sign-intertextual reading) are eclectically and concertedly utilized by means of sampling analysis. Utilizing this integrative method, the findings are as follows: (1) the interwoven network of the prologue (Rev 1 : 1 - 8) programmatically provides the paradigmatic reading strategy for understanding the key paraenetic motif {{in the rest of}} the book against <b>the</b> background of <b>salvific</b> history; (2) by summarizing the churches’ earthly prophetic roles – withdrawal and witness through martyrdom – in terms of conquering, the model author alerts his audience to the military significance of their daily actions or choices in their ordinary earthly lives through visionary communication; (3) just as the prologue preliminarily guides, the ever-forward-moving historical framework serves as an incentive device for the paraenetic-imperative in Rev 2 - 3 and 4 - 22...|$|R

After a survey {{of the state of the}} art on soteriology in 1 Peter, the relevant methodological issues (pertaining to soteriology, metaphor and the socio-historical ecology of metaphors) are considered.

Finally <b>the</b> <b>salvific</b> metaphors in 1 Peter are identified, a tentative inter- pretation is given, and a matrix of these metaphors is proposed...|$|R
