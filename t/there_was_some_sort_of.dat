Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills. Damien Marken and Kirk Straight, use this—as well as inscriptions on stelae at Palenque—to argue that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> relationship between the two polities.|$|E

The use of the term RVN was only created after executive producer Rick Berman requested something similar to DNA.

500|$|Following the season, on 31 May 2008, Milan {{vice-president}} Adriano Galliani {{revealed that}} the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008–09 season to allow him more playing time. In 2010, {{in an interview with}} French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it. Gourcuff did not respond to the comments, but his father Christian did, stating to France Football that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son's image. The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini's charges stating his son [...] "took two hours (of Italian language courses) per day and spoke Italian after two months" [...] and that [...] "he is passionate about tactics" [...] in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically. Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean-Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini's comments [...] "Yoann is not like that. A number ten who does not play with the group is a little weird. This does not correspond at all to what we saw with Yoann at Bordeaux. He was well integrated with his teammates, and collectively with them on the ground. He left good memories here." ...|$|E

[...] The King surmised that Castlereagh believed he was being blackmailed for the same reason.

2500|$|However, a {{transverse}} wave apparently required the propagating medium {{to behave as}} a solid, {{as opposed to a}} gas or fluid. The idea of a solid that did not interact with other matter seemed a bit odd, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy suggested that perhaps <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "dragging", or [...] "entrainment", but this made the aberration measurements difficult to understand. He also suggested that the absence of longitudinal waves suggested that the aether had negative compressibility. George Green pointed out that such a fluid would be unstable. George Gabriel Stokes became a champion of the entrainment interpretation, developing a model in which the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid at very high frequencies and fluid at lower speeds. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to support light.|$|E

2500|$|After {{securing}} press credentials {{for herself}} and a photographer, and after visiting Peru's Congress to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a seating plan, Berenson was arrested on a public bus along with the photographer. Her photographer {{turned out to be}} the wife of a top MRTA leader, a fact which Berenson stated she was unaware of at that time. The MRTA is alleged to have intended to use the information to seize lawmakers and exchange the hostages for imprisoned MRTA members. The house she rented in Lima was found to contain an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, together with armed guerrillas who violently resisted capture. She denied knowing of the presence of either the weaponry or the guerillas, and she also denied knowing that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. In 2011 she admitted that she had known that her associates were MRTA members and she said: [...] "It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them." [...] In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, and she also maintained that she was unaware that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that [...] "at that time in Fujimori’s dictatorship, Congress was the only place that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> democratic process." ...|$|E
