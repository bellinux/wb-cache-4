25|$|In Queensland on 10 January 1916 Canon David John Garland was {{appointed}} the honorary {{secretary of the}} Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as be the date promoted as “Anzac Day” in 1916 and ever after. Devoted {{to the cause of}} a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes.|$|E
25|$|Each day of reburials {{opened with}} a parade where a {{ceremonial}} guard oversaw the raising of the Union (British), Australian and French flags. Following a blessing by the military chaplains, the flags were lowered to half-staff, and the reburials began. Each funeral followed the same standard pattern used for the inaugural reburial, but were carried out in pairs to reflect the joint British-Australian nature of the battle. A bearer party conveyed each coffin from a hearse to the designated burial plot, and the chaplain conducted the funeral service. At {{the end of the}} day, the chaplain said a prayer, military collects were read out by Australian and British soldiers, and a soldier recited the Exhortation from the Ode of Remembrance ("They shall grow not old... We will remember them"). Following this, a firing party fired three volleys, a trumpeter sounded the Last Post, and a one-minute silence was held. <b>The</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> broken by the trumpeter sounding Reveille, the chaplain then read a final blessing, the flags were raised back to full-staff and then re-lowered and removed, and the parade marched off.|$|E

25|$|In the {{swirling}} cloud and snow they abandoned plans to descend via the sharp, unclimbed east ridge. Grove’s partner, Edward North Buxton, suggested {{remaining on the}} summit {{for a couple of}} hours to see if the weather would improve, but the rest of the party rejected his proposal, recognising there was neither sufficient daylight left for them to descend the impossibly exposed and unknown east ridge, nor to down-climb the sheer route they had just ascended. They chose instead to attempt a descent down the unknown southern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. They found it trying work to descending the steep ice bank from the summit in the furious storm, but managed eventually to find their way down through one stone-raked couloir to another on the mountain’s south-east face. As twilight fell they reached the head of the Glacier de Bionnassay Italian which formed the northern arm of the huge Glacier du Miage. Here, at a height well above that of the Col de Miage (3,300 m) upon which they could look down, they found refuge amongst rocks beside the steep glacier. They tried to rest there, having had nothing to drink all day except a little brandy and some tasteless wine that they had brought with them; glacial meltwater flowing beneath the rocks on which they sat were totally inaccessible to them. They were also wet through from the storm which by now had passed over, revealing a clear, starry sky. The trickles of water ceased as the temperature dropped below freezing and the night slowly became calm until <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> shattered by the roar of rockfall over their heads. Abandoning their bivouac site, they took refuge amongst steeply sloping rocks which offered protection from stonefall, but no comfort whatsoever. After a miserable night’s rest, dawn eventually arrived and the ice-rimed party again began to descend the glacier, led by their guide, Cachat. Eight hours later they arrived at the village of St Gervais and sought appropriate refreshment in a well-to-do hotel, much to the disapprobation of the other guests who regarded their appearance and clothing with horror.|$|E
500|$|The three Texian {{sentinels}} stationed {{outside the}} walls were killed in their sleep, allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the walls. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> broken by shouts of [...] "¡Viva Santa Anna!" [...] and music from the buglers. The noise woke the Texians. Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety. Travis rushed to his post yelling, [...] "Come on boys, the Mexicans are upon us and we'll give them hell!" [...] and, as he passed a group of Tejanos, [...] "¡No rendirse, muchachos!" [...] ("Don't surrender, boys").|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Paige {{made her}} United States concert debut {{when she opened}} the Boston Pops season, which was aired on WGBH in America. The {{following}} year, she made a guest appearance at Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th birthday celebration at the Royal Albert Hall, performing [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] and [...] "Memory" [...] She then played Célimène in the non-musical play The Misanthrope in 1998, but she admitted that she missed the musical element and that <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> slightly unsettling to her. A Lifetime Achievement Award from The National Operatic and Dramatic Association soon followed. She later performed alongside Bette Midler in a 1999 New York concert {{to raise money for the}} Breast Cancer Research Foundation.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>are</b> a {{religious}} {{order in the}} British science fiction television programme Doctor Who, represented by humanoids with alien-like physical characteristics. Executive producer Steven Moffat created <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> intending them to be scarier than past villains in Doctor Who. Though the phrase [...] "Silence will fall" [...] recurred throughout the 2010 series of Doctor Who, <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>were</b> not seen until the 2011 series' opener [...] "The Impossible Astronaut". Their origins are eventually revealed in the 2013 special [...] "The Time of the Doctor".|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> {{created to}} compete with other past aliens in terms of [...] "scariness," [...] {{including}} the Weeping Angels. The episode was partially filmed on location at Lone Rock, Utah, {{the first time in}} Doctor Who that principal photography took place in the United States. Before the broadcast, a fan leaked the plot of the episode following a press screening. The episode was seen by 8.86 million viewers in the United Kingdom, and received generally positive reviews from critics. [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] gained an Appreciation Index of 88 [...] considered excellent. The episode was dedicated to Elisabeth Sladen, known for playing former companion Sarah Jane Smith, who died from cancer on 19 April 2011.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron sat {{in the back of a}} squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat, head {{writer of}} the new series, said before {{broadcast}} {{that this would be}} one of the darkest openers to a series ever done for Doctor Who. Director Toby Haynes believed that the darker episodes like [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] would allow the series to get into [...] "more dangerous territory." [...] The creation of <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> partly inspired by the figure from the Edvard Munch painting The Scream. Introducing the alien villains became a [...] "big challenge" [...] for the producers; it would tie in with the loose [...] "silence will fall" [...] arc that carried through the fifth series. Moffat did not wish to end the arc in the previous series, as he felt it would be [...] "more fun" [...] to continue it. Elsewhere in the episode, Delaware was written to be deceptively antagonistic towards the protagonists, which was based on actor Mark Sheppard's past as villains for his work in American television. Moffat was also keen on the idea of having the Doctor imprisoned with a beard in Area 51. Smith wore a glued-on beard, which was difficult to peel off.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence {{documented}} alleged abuses {{committed by}} Israeli soldiers guarding the Hebron settlers, Mario Vargas Llosa claimed that local Arabs are [...] "subjected to systematic and ferocious harassment by settlers, who stone them, throw rubbish and excrement at their houses, invade and destroy their homes, and attack their {{children when they}} return from school, to the absolute indifference of Israeli soldiers who witness these atrocities." [...] Breaking <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>was</b> criticized for refusing to support its claims with evidence.|$|E
2500|$|The buzzing {{sound of}} the V-1's pulse jet engine was likened by some to [...] "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the {{sound of the}} {{propulsion}} unit spluttering and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive). [...] At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August {{a million and a half}} people had left London and the rate of work production was affected. By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken and people started returning to London.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 July 2016, at 7:28am British Summer Time, the UK {{observed}} a two minute silence {{to mark the}} start of the battle which began 100 years earlier. A special ceremony was broadcast on BBC1 and all BBC radio stations participated in the silence. At {{the start of the}} silence, the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a gun every four seconds for one hundred seconds and a whistle was blown to end it. Just like a Remembrance Sunday silence, a bugler played The Last Post after the silence. <b>The</b> <b>silence</b> <b>was</b> announced during a speech by the Prime Minister David Cameron who said, [...] "There will be a national two-minute silence on Friday morning. I will be attending a service at the Thiepval Memorial near the battlefield, and it's right that the whole country pauses to remember the sacrifices of all those who fought and lost their lives in that conflict." [...] On 1 July 2016, a ceremony was held in Heaton Park in north Manchester in England. Heaton Park was the site of a large army training camp during the war.|$|E
