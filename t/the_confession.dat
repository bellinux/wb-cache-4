5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Confession,</b> it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to <b>the</b> <b>Confession,</b> which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith was officially interpreted {{with reference to}} five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E

40|$|The hermeneutics of <b>the</b> {{reformed}} <b>confessions.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of}} this article, in the first place, is to honour the work that Prof Gert (Jorrie) Jordaan has done over several decades, especiallyin the field of hermeneutics. Secondly, the article {{wants to make a}} contribution regardinganother aspect of hermeneutics, namely the hermeneutics of <b>the</b> reformed <b>confessions.</b> A closerelationship exists between Scripture and <b>the</b> <b>confessions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>confessions</b> is a summary or‘authoritative commentary’ on the core truths of the doctrine in Scripture. They are ecclesiastical documents, authoritative and binding on officials and church members of churches in the reformed tradition. They are commentaries or interpretations, but also need to be interpreted. Due to their unique character and function, the hermeneutics of <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> is of utmostimportance. The article formulates ten guidelines that are, {{in the view of the}} author, essentialfor the contemporary interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>confessions...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E

5|$|Archbishop Michael Peers {{apologized to}} {{residential}} school survivors, {{on behalf of}} the Anglican Church of Canada, on August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in Minaki, Ontario. The following year the Presbyterian Church in Canada adopted a confession at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. <b>The</b> <b>confession</b> was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>confessions</b> had a {{significant}} impact on the Chinese-American community: as a result of <b>the</b> <b>confessions,</b> 22,083 people were exposed and 11,294 paper son slots were closed.

40|$|The {{reformed}} churches historically {{call themselves}} confessional churches, with <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> adopted by church councils being the yardstick {{according to which}} membership is either permitted or refused. The reformed churches consequently consider it necessary for {{all members of the}} church to express agreement with <b>the</b> <b>confessions.</b> <b>The</b> reason why <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> are held as the summary standard of belief is founded in the conviction that they are faithful expressions of the teachings handed down from the apostles.   These confessions have been attributed a twofold purpose regarding their function in the reformed churches. Firstly, they protect believers and congregations from error, and secondly, they help attain unity of faith among the believers in the reformed churches – both at the congregational and denominational level.   Currently this view is under siege from those who hold the conviction that the traditional approach of giving <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> such prominence is too narrow and binding in terms of {{who may or may not}} be awarded membership of the reformed churches.   This article seeks to consider the place of <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> and to evaluate the claim that de-emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> is desirable in order to celebrate the unity of all believers. Furthermore, the article seeks to demonstrate that ethical integrity is contingent on seeking to exercise church government within the demarcation of the confessional framework...|$|R

5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E
5|$|After Jack Bauer {{fails to}} obtain a {{confession}} from Logan, she screams in public {{that he is a}} murderer during Palmer's funeral. Afterwards, President Logan hits her, and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life. During his tirade, Logan acknowledges all of his misdeeds, unaware that there is a small listening device on his pen. <b>The</b> <b>confession</b> quickly reaches the Attorney General, who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan. As Charles is escorted away by agents, he turns to stare at Martha, who smiles at him in triumph.|$|E

5000|$|Besides <b>the</b> {{principal}} Reformed <b>Confessions</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> [...] Tetrapolitan, Basel and [...] Helvetic, and Belgic Confessions), three Lutheran Confessions {{are also}} used, viz., <b>the</b> Augsburg <b>Confession,</b> <b>the</b> Saxon <b>Confession</b> (Confessio Saxonica), and <b>the</b> Württemberg <b>Confession,</b> {{as well as}} <b>the</b> Bohemian <b>Confession</b> (1573) and Anglican <b>Confession</b> (1562). <b>The</b> work appeared almost simultaneously with the Lutheran Formula of Concord, and may be called a Reformed Formula of Concord, though differing from the former in being a mere compilation from previous symbols.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> French <b>Confession,</b> <b>the</b> Scots <b>Confession,</b> <b>the</b> Belgic <b>Confession,</b> and <b>the</b> Heidelberg Catechism, all include {{references}} to the Virgin Birth, mentioning specifically, that Jesus was born without the participation of a man. Invocations to Mary were not tolerated however, in light of Calvin's position, that any prayer to saints {{in front of an}} altar is prohibited.|$|R
5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>Confession.</b> By the 1940s, {{the dominance of}} liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E
5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and {{evidence}} against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E

5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} {{confession}} of faith, and Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the Eucharist, the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement to subscribe to <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he will get a confession out of Staley, whether he did it or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton makes him feel responsible for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E
5|$|Initially J. D. B. {{denied any}} wrongdoing. After being {{confronted with the}} stolen camera and after the urging of a school administrator, J. D. B. confessed to the break-ins.

B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E
5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects {{to give up their}} pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E
5|$|While imprisoned and {{awaiting}} execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby {{of perjury}} {{with regard to}} the alleged 1824 meeting between them. Many believed Beauchamp's accusation was meant to curry favor with New Court governor Joseph Desha – who considered Darby a political enemy – and to secure a pardon from him. When Beauchamp finished <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer for immediate publication. An Old Court supporter, the printer refused to publish it.|$|E
