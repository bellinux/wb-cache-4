5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, and he had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family business, being the first son. This {{had an impact on}} him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He {{had to take care of}} his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

500|$|After being captured, Woodruff {{was imprisoned}} in the Changi Prison Camp. In the camp, Woodruff {{realized}} that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese to allow him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, soya beans, rice polishings, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled [...] "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps". Woodruff remained a POW {{for three and a}} half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.|$|E
