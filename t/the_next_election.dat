This was a Liberal held seat although the sitting member was retiring at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> Mitchell took the seat with a 5,000 vote {{majority in the}} 1970 general election. His main opponent in that election was Laura Grimond, wife of former Liberal leader Jo Grimond.|$|E
5|$|Local governments {{follow a}} {{modified}} version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election,</b> however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.|$|E

5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> and that, since his resignation, he had {{received}} encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a few of}} Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge {{initially}} retained all of them, out of {{an ardent}} conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> season.|$|E

According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{a change}} in {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin. After {{the election}} results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> On February 1, 2006, the Liberal Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at the Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2–3, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Having {{confirmed}} his Lang credentials, Heffron stood as the endorsed Labor party {{candidate for the}} seat of Botany at the 1927 election, which was held by Thomas Mutch, who had split from party after a stoush with Lang and stood as an 'Independent Labor' candidate after being denied preselection. A contest marked by clashes and accusations of rorting, Heffron was ultimately unsuccessful, gaining only 45% of the vote. He was eventually successful at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election</b> in 1930, defeating Mutch, and would hold Botany until its abolition in 1950.|$|E

Miliband applied for selection to be the candidate in the safe Labour seat and won, beating off a close challenge from Michael Dugher, then a SPAD to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon.|$|E

5|$|In the Khaki Election of 1900, {{nationalist}} {{concern with}} the Boer War meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>election.</b> Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E
