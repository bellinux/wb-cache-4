The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E

The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008; Sydney was found on 17 March, five days after her adversary. Sydneys defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and Kormorans advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. However, the cruiser's loss with all hands compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> most of the Germans have resulted in controversy, with some alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure Sydney into range, that a Japanese submarine {{was involved}}, and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide-ranging cover up.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> orangutans in the wild.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the impala as {{a species}} of least concern overall. The black-faced impala, however, is {{classified}} as a vulnerable species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to {{the decline of the}} black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million.

5|$|The Sind sparrow has a {{restricted}} distribution, primarily occurring within the Indus valley of Pakistan, {{and the lower}} parts of the tributaries of the Indus in the Punjab region. Its distribution extends from the Indus Delta north to the Kabul River near Nowshera and the Jhelum near Nurpur Noon, extending east into India {{as far as the}} Delhi area. It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of Balochistan, and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran. The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range, and no threats are known <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the species, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
