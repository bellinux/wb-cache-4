Such projects could include renewable energy systems, advanced fossil energy technologies, and production facilities for fuel-efficient vehicles. Although EPAct 05 authorized the LGP, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that Congress appropriate budget authority for loan guarantee program costs before loans can be made. In appropriating budget authority for the LGP, Congress would be not only authorizing DOE to issue the loan guarantees but also establishing policy by setting limits on the dollar amount of loans that can be guaranteed. Congress can also specify limits {{on the amount of}} LGP administrative costs DOE can incur each year.

40|$|The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, {{also known}} as fire grants or the FIRE Act grant program, was {{established}} by <b>Title</b> <b>XVII</b> of the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act (P. L. 106 - 398). Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. A related program is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters (SAFER) program, which provides grants for hiring, recruiting, and retaining firefighters. The fire grant program {{is now in its}} 13 th year. The Fire Act statute was reauthorized in 2012 (Title XVIII of P. L. 112 - 239) and provides new guidelines on how fire grant money should be distributed. There is no set geographical formula for the distribution of fire grants—fire departments throughout the nation apply, and award decisions are made by a peer panel based on the merits of the application and the needs of the community. However, the law does require that fire grants be distributed to a diverse mix of fire departments, with respect to type of department (paid, volunteer, or combination), geographic location, and type of community served (e. g., urban, suburban, or rural). For FY 2012, P. L. 112 - 74, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, provided $ 675 million for firefighter assistance, including $ 337. 5 million for AFG and $ 337. 5 million for SAFER. The Administration’s FY 2013 budget proposed $ 670 million for firefighter assistance, including $ 335 million for AFG and $ 335 million for SAFER. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P. L. 112 - 175), funds firefighter assistance programs through {{the first six months of}} FY 2013 at an increase of 0. 612 % of the FY 2012 level. Therefore, under the FY 2013 continuing resolution, AFG is funded at $ 339. 5 million and SAFER is funded at $ 339. 5 million through March 2013. The 113 th Congress will likely consider FY 2013 and FY 2014 budget appropriations for AFG and SAFER. As is the case with many federal programs, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact budget levels for AFG and SAFER. At the same time, firefighter assistance budgets will likely receive heightened scrutiny from the fire community, given the local budgetary cutbacks that many fire departments are facing...|$|E
