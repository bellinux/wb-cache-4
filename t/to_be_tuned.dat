5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
25|$|The first laser {{was made}} with a rod of {{synthetic}} ruby. Titanium-sapphire lasers are popular due to their relatively rare capacity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to various wavelengths in the red and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They can also be easily mode-locked. In these lasers a synthetically produced sapphire crystal with chromium or titanium impurities is irradiated with intense light from a special lamp, or another laser, to create stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally radio {{programmes}} were {{broadcast on}} different frequencies via AM and FM, {{and the radio}} had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> into each frequency, as needed. This used up a comparatively large amount of spectrum for {{a relatively small number}} of stations, limiting listening choice. DAB is a digital radio broadcasting system that through the application of multiplexing and compression combines multiple audio streams onto a relatively narrow band centred on a single broadcast frequency called a DAB ensemble.|$|E

QD's size quantization allows for the band gap <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> by simply changing particle size. They also have high extinction coefficients and have shown the possibility of multiple exciton generation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the optic}} tectum {{of the brain}} which {{eventually}} processes these infrared cues. This portion of the brain receives other sensory information as well, most notably optic stimulation, but also motor, proprioceptive and auditory. Some neurons in the tectum respond to visual or infrared stimulation alone; others respond more strongly to combined visual and infrared stimulation, and still others respond only {{to a combination of}} visual and infrared. Some neurons appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to detect movement in one direction. It has been found that the snake’s visual and infrared maps of the world are overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.|$|E
25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E

25|$|The bass type, {{similarly}} to the theorbo and other baroque lutes, has a vaulted body (shell) constructed of separate ribs, a flat soundboard {{with either a}} carved rose or one which is inset into the soundhole, and a bridge (without a saddle) consisting of a wooden bar acting as a string-holder glued to the soundboard. Unique to this instrument is the neck, which is long enough to allow for ten to 12 tied gut frets. The pegbox is either straight and set at a sharp angle to the neck (much like a lute pegbox), or gently curving and set at a shallow angle, either case being fitted with laterally-inserted tuning pegs (although sometimes a flat pegboard with sagittal pegs is found). The strings were of gut and are strung either singly or, especially on Italian instruments, in double courses. However, on German-made instruments, the first course (highest in pitch) is usually single (a chanterelle) and often has its own separate raised peg rider/holder attached to the pegbox. The number of courses varies from six to eight. Open string lengths tend to be fairly long (6272cm) on German instruments, but shorter (5565cm) on late Italian ones, probably because they tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to a higher pitch.|$|E
500|$|Dielectric {{resonators}} are {{pieces of}} dielectric material {{inserted into the}} waveguide. [...] They are usually cylindrical since these {{can be made with}}out machining but other shapes have been used. [...] They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide. [...] There is no field at the centre when the TE011 circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect. [...] The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8. [...] The latter arrangement allows the resonators <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator.|$|E
500|$|Mole crickets stridulate {{like other}} crickets by {{scraping}} the rear {{edge of the}} left forewing, which forms a plectrum, against the lower surface of the right forewing, which has a ratchet-like series of asymmetric teeth: the more acute edges face backwards, as do those of the plectrum. The plectrum can move forwards with little resistance; but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth, setting up a vibration in both wings. The sound-producing stroke is the raising (levation) of the wings. The resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a 66 Hertz wave to form regular chirps. In G. vineae, the wing levator muscle, which weighs 50 milligrams, can deliver 3.5 milliWatts of mechanical power; G. gryllotalpa can deliver about 1 milliWatt. G. vineae produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset, continuing for an hour; it can be heard up to 600 metres away. At a distance of 1 metre from the burrow, the sound has a mean power over the stridulation cycle of up to 88 decibels; the loudest recorded peak power was about 92 decibels; at the mouths of the burrow, the sound reaches around 115 decibels. G. gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels. [...] The throat of the horn appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> (offering low inductive reactance), making the burrow radiate sound efficiently; the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound. Mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound-producing apparatus. Given the known sensitivity of a cricket's hearing (60 decibels), a night-flying G. vineae female {{should be able to}} detect the male's song at a range of 30 metres; this compares to about 5 metres for a typical Gryllus cricket that does not construct a burrow.|$|E

2500|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the violin is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to D–A–D–A in the South Indian style. As {{there is no}} concept of absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is B–F–B–F, which corresponds to Sa–Pa–Sa–Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. In the North Indian Hindustani style, the tuning is usually Pa-Sa-Pa-Sa instead of Sa–Pa–Sa–Pa. This could correspond to F–B–F–B, for instance. In Iranian classical music and Iranian light music, the violin ls different tunings in any Dastgah, the violin is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> (E–A–E–A) in Dastgah-h Esfahan or in [...] Dastgāh-e Šur is (E–A–D–E) and (E–A–E–E), in Dastgāh-e Māhur is (E–A–D–A). In Arabic classical music, the A and E strings are lowered by a whole step i.e. G–D–G–D. This is to ease playing Arabic maqams, especially those containing quarter tones.|$|E

2500|$|Timpani ( [...] ; [...] ) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical {{instruments}} in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper.

Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resonant}} circuit (tuned circuit) which serves {{to select the}} frequency of the desired radio station out of all the radio signals received by the antenna. The tuned circuit consists of a coil of wire (called an inductor) and a capacitor connected together, so as to create a circuit that resonates at {{the frequency of the}} desired station, and hence [...] "tune" [...] in that station. One or both of the coil or capacitor is adjustable, allowing the circuit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tuned</b> to different frequencies. In some circuits a capacitor is not used, as the antenna also serves as the capacitor. The tuned circuit has a resonant frequency and allows radio waves at that frequency to pass to the detector, while rejecting waves at all other frequencies. Such a circuit is also known as a bandpass filter.|$|E
