5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
25|$|The Ché Café is {{a student}} worker {{cooperative}} and social center <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{best known for its}} role as a venue for underground music scene. It is an on-and-off again vegan cafe and catering operation as well. The Ché also acts as a resource for the music and art departments on campus through hosting art shows, performances, and film screenings. Some of the most notable touring bands or musicians who have played at the Ché include: Bon Iver, Green Day, Rise Against, Jimmy Eat World, Matt & Kim, Billy Corgan, Blonde Redhead, Bomb the Music Industry!, The Get Up Kids, Deerhoof, Bright Eyes, Chumbawamba, Mike Watt, Hella, Dan Deacon, Unwound, and Jawbreaker. Prominent local San Diego bands such as The Locust and Pinback, and national tours such as Mates of State and The Dillinger Escape Plan have given the Ché Café some fame and praise as a radical vegan collective despite its small size and limited sound equipment.|$|E
25|$|Annoyed at Sir Eglamour’s success, {{the next}} task that the earl gives his daughter’s suitor {{is to kill}} the Boar of Sidon, a dreadful beast that has laid waste to the area where it lives. Sir Eglamour spends a month {{travelling}} out to Sidon where he locates this boar by seeing all the bodies of dead men strewn about the ground; in a scene <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> mimicked by one featuring a Rabbit of Caerbannog in the irreverent Monty Python movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After a struggle with this boar that lasts for three days, Sir Eglamour kills the ferocious creature. His feat of bravery and skill-at-arms is noticed by the King of Sidon, who is riding nearby {{on the day that}} Sir Eglamour at last overcomes this beast. The king takes Sir Eglamour back to his castle where his daughter (beautiful, of course) is being threatened by a giant. This giant is demanding her hand in marriage and when he appears, Sir Eglamour kills him singlehandedly. The King of Sidon at once offers to confer onto Sir Eglamour all his titles and lands, as well as the hand of his daughter in marriage.|$|E

When he first met with its leaders in 1951, Schumacher believed that 150,000 people were already members of HIAG, as evidenced by internal party correspondence; he considered that number to be [...] "politically significant".

500|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} made of Stanford's music by writers from Shaw onwards {{is that his}} music lacks passion. Shaw praised [...] "Stanford the Celt" [...] and abominated [...] "Stanford the Professor", who reined in the emotions of the Celt. In Stanford's church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds [...] "a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> lacking in deeply felt religious impulse." [...] In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so. Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that [...] "only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity." ...|$|E

[...] Steiner told Rosenbaum that [...] "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way". Hitler's genius lay [...] "not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as [...] "mesmeric". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as [...] "a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself" [...] and that his language is [...] "like 'antimatter' to ordinary language".|$|E

The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a [...] "dynamic pace", as well as Anderson himself. Muir summarises the final product as a [...] "Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding [...] fashion", and a [...] "time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction". To Law, it is [...] "half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados", but [...] "an interesting look at what might have been" [...] if Anderson {{had been able to}} produce a full series. Mills interprets it as a [...] "solid little piece of 70s juvenile sci-fi" [...] <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> [...] "not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun".|$|E
500|$|Why Sibelius {{should have}} failed to prepare The Wood Nymph for {{publication}} {{is a question that}} has perplexed scholars. On the advice of Ferruccio Busoni, Sibelius in 1895 offered The Wood Nymph to the Russian music publisher Mitrofan Belyayev but it was not published. Murtomäki has suggested that Sibelius, despite having been fond of The Wood Nymph, was [...] "unsure about the true value" [...] of his output from the 1890s, an ambivalence <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of, and multiple revisions to, the four Lemminkäinen legends (appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten, The Wood Nymph, too, seems to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination, albeit one that never came to pass). Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have [...] "turned his back" [...] on his early compositions. Perhaps, as master, he looked back on the works of his youth as technically [...] "inferior" [...] to his mature output; or, as evolving artist, he sought distance from passionate, nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own, unique musical style and aimed to transition from [...] "local hero" [...] to [...] "international composer"; or, as elder statesman, he feared he might have [...] "revealed himself too much" [...] in early [...] "confessional" [...] works, such as En saga, Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, and The Wood Nymph. In the absence of any new information from Sibelius's papers, however, the reason why The Wood Nymph was never published ultimately [...] "appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{smuggling}} of silkworm eggs from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes {{of how the}} Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings {{for the privilege of}} traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned to death. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians. However, even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century, Chinese varieties were still considered of better quality, a fact <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> underscored by the discovery of a Byzantine solidus coin minted during the reign of Justin II found in a Sui dynasty (581-618 AD) Chinese tomb of Shanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites. According to Chinese histories, the Byzantines (i.e. [...] "Fu-lin"), maintaining an earlier Roman diplomatic tradition in China, also sent several embassies to the court of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) and on one occasion to that of the Song dynasty (960-1279), offering exotic gifts such as glasswares while demonstrating a continual interest in the Chinese silk trade. The 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta provided a fairly accurate depiction of China, its geography, its reunification by the Sui dynasty (581-618), and even named its ruler Taisson as meaning [...] "Son of God", perhaps also derived from the name Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649). Contemporary Chinese sources, namely the Old and New Book of Tang, also depicted the city of Constantinople and how it was besieged by Muawiyah I (founder of the Umayyad Caliphate), who exacted tribute afterwards.|$|E
