5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave <b>Trade</b> <b>Bill</b> was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, April 22, 1920, the House reported {{its passage}} of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though {{they were on the}} Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping <b>trade</b> <b>bill</b> out of turn had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{administration}} {{failed to achieve}} either Catholic emancipation or peace with France, Fox's last great achievement would be {{the abolition of the}} slave trade in 1807. Though Fox was to die before abolition was enacted, he oversaw a Foreign Slave <b>Trade</b> <b>Bill</b> in spring 1806 that prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain’s wartime enemies, thus eliminating two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.|$|E

25|$|His {{economic}} policy consisted of making budget cuts among various departments {{of the federal}} government. One of his primary contributions was in helping to re-design the Bureau of Internal Revenue, action {{which led to the}} creation of the Internal Revenue Service.

25|$|Lawton {{most often}} backed the {{policies}} of Truman. He joined with Truman in fighting a fair <b>trade</b> <b>bill</b> in Congress. Lawton supported a requested merger of Pan American World Airways and American Overseas Airlines, a plan that Truman initially opposed, but then passed over {{the recommendation of the}} Civil Aeronautics Board. Lawton vocally opposed plans to decentralize the federal offices in Washington, D.C., spreading them throughout the country so that an enemy attack would not cripple the entire national government. Lawton argued that there was a shortage of office space around the country that made the plans impossible to implement. Lawton often removed himself from debates, treating his job as a technical and administrative one. While he advocated fiscal restraint, he mostly found ways of carrying out Truman's policies, rather than arguing for them. He sought less publicity than his predecessors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} voting {{by members}} of Congress on three <b>trade</b> <b>bills</b> introduced in 1993 and 1994 : the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the agreements concluded in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (GATT), and most-favored nation status for China. We first review recnet political economy models of trade policy and then presenting a brief legislative history of the three bills, use these models to formulate an empirical specification of political behavior. In our empirical tests, we find evidence that campaign contributions given be political action committees influenced legislators' votes on both the NAFTA and GATT bills. Contributions from labor groups were associated with votes against freer trade, while contributions from business groups were associated with votes in favor of freer trade. We also find that the broad policy views of the legislators, industry employment in each member's state or congressional district, and general economic conditions in the district or state affected voting on the <b>trade</b> <b>bills.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a <b>trade</b> <b>bill,</b> whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E
