Budget provisions for revenue and expenditure were juxtaposed and their relativity shown. Actual expenditure was matched against the budgets to identify accounting variances. The ANOVA method was employed to analyze the data while the F- statistic was employed to test the significance of differences in the variables.

40|$|Considering {{the dynamic}} nature of {{information}} and information sources, coupled with the sophistication of users and advances in the technology, {{it is necessary that}} library and information practitioners actively engage in continuous professional development (CPD) in order to meet up with the challenges and render quality services. This study investigates the CPD involvement of professional librarians in Nigeria. A social survey method of research was adopted for the study and questionnaire was used for data collection. The outcome of the study reveals that libraries have CPD policies but poor <b>budgetary</b> <b>provisions,</b> lack of relevant committees, and motivation for staff hinders its implementation. Also, librarians majorly engage in workshop and conferences as a means of professional development as against networking or group discussion, mentoring, study visits, reading professional literature, etc. Major challenge to the involvement of librarians in CPD activities are lack of instructional support and poor funding. The study recommends among others adequate <b>budgetary</b> <b>provision</b> for CPD, constitution of relevant implementation committees, adequate sensitization of librarians on various CPD avenues, and adoption of robust model professional development of librarians...|$|R

40|$|Innovation is {{frequently}} argued {{to be critical}} to organizational performance in an increasingly competitive international marketplace. The literature suggests that one factor influencing a firm's competitive position {{is the degree to}} which subordinates are innovative. Subordinate managers typically have the skills that enable them to bring into their firms new ideas arising from their interest in, and their knowledge of, developments in their areas of expertise. If managers have an interest in innovation, then participation in the budget setting process may enable them to be party to budgets which not only reflect resource commitments and other <b>budgetary</b> <b>provisions</b> associated with their innovation proposals, but also the expectation of benefits arising from innovations in terms of enhanced departmental performance.

Analysis of the 2010 Census of Population and Housing data has generated information on the poverty status of provinces and districts in Zambia and has ranked them from the relatively well-off to the worseoff.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a political economy {{explanation for the}} occurrence of fiscal consolidation {{by looking at the}} distributional effects of preceding real exchange rate depreciations across and within countries. Existing studies show that successful fiscal consolidation episodes tend to be preceded by downwards exchange rate movements (Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; Hjelm 2002; Lambertini and Tavares 2005). We show that the mechanism through which this happens differs across open and closed economies. In the former, there is a “good-times effect” following depreciation that induces the public to accept fiscal reform {{in the form of a}} social pact that contains <b>budgetary</b> <b>provisions,</b> provided it has similar distributional implications. By contrast, in closed economies, real depreciations impact differently on different socio-economic groups. That way, they open up room for a political exchange between competing interests that is likely to lead to a social pact and to fiscal reform, the wider its distributional implications. The argument is tested on a sample of OECD countries over 1987 - 2009...|$|R
