5|$|Across <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow.

Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E

5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
