Economic and {{environmental}} objectives are traditionally seen as mutually exclusive, especially {{in terms of}} higher economic growth rates that are coupled with higher greenhouse gas emissions. The first aim {{of this study is to}} find a possible creative solution, in which higher economic growth can be coupled with lower greenhouse gas emissions, also known as low-carbon growth. The literature review shows that the economic growth aspect of low-carbon growth can be achieved by increasing exports. The other part of low-carbon growth, namely lower greenhouse gas intensity, can be achieved by diffusing low-carbon technologies (or environmental goods). The World Trade Organisation also encouraged the liberalisation of environmental goods. Therefore, low-carbon growth could be achieved by promoting the production and exports of low-carbon environmental goods. Although the World Trade Organisations has encouraged the liberation of environmental goods, there is no official list of environmental goods. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to derive a list of low-carbon environmental goods from existing lists of environmental goods. Thirty-nine lowcarbon environmental goods are identified for the purpose of this study. The Decision Support Model (DSM) is used to identify realistic export opportunities for these environmental goods. These low-carbon environmental goods were ranked based on three criteria: i) their potential environmental benefits, ii) South Africa’s capacity to produce these goods, and iii) their potential economic benefits. The five low-carbon environmental goods that ranked the highest are photosensitive semiconductors (HS- 6 : 854140), <b>towers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> (HS- 6 : 730820), electrical control and distribution boards smaller than 1 kV (HS- 6 : 853710), gearing, ball screws, speed changers, torque converter (HS- 6 : 848340), and static converters (HS- 6 : 850440). The exact environmental uses, producers, intensive and extensive export opportunities of the top five goods were discussed. The best overall intensive export opportunities according to potential export value are HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors (USD 922, 362, 000) to Germany and HS- 6 : 853710; electrical control and distribution boards smaller than 1 kV, to the United States (USD 838, 671, 000). The best overall extensive export opportunities according to their potential export value are HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors to China (USD 953, 255, 000) and HS- 6 : 854140; photosensitive semiconductors to Hong Kong (USD 363, 505, 000). The results of this study will enable policy-makers to make optimal decisions regarding which environmental goods to produce and export. Master...|$|E
50|$|The tripod mast {{is a type}} of mast used on {{warships}} {{from the}} Edwardian era onwards, replacing the pole <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>mast.</b> Tripod masts are notable for using three large (usually cylindrical) support columns spread out at angles to brace each other.|$|R
50|$|Tripod masts were predated by pole <b>masts</b> <b>and</b> {{lightweight}} <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> {{a system}} which used an array of thin columns at angles, crossing {{each other in a}} double helical spiral configuration in a form of hyperboloid structure. The US Navy favoured the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> which they used on their first battleships in 1906. The Royal Navy preferred pole or tripod masts.|$|R
50|$|The masts were {{intended}} to provide a raised platform for visual observers and for fire control equipment, elevated up above the main hull for visibility and {{to reduce the risk}} of shell damage to the gear <b>and</b> crews. <b>Lattice</b> <b>masts</b> also accomplished those goals, but the masts proved less structurally sound than intended. On January 15, 1918, the USS Michigan (BB-27) had a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> collapse in an intense storm.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} standard IEC 61400 - 12 - 1 “Wind turbines – Part 12 - 1 : Power performance measurements of electricity producing wind turbines” aims {{to provide a}} uniform methodology that will ensure consistency, accuracy and reproducibility in the measurement and analysis of power performance by wind turbines [1]. Annex G of this standard provides a methodology for the appropriate arrangement of instruments on the meteorological mast to ensure accurate measurement. For cup anemometers it provides recommendations about their location relative to the mast so {{that the effect of}} mast and boom interference on their output may be minimised. These recommendations are given for both tubular <b>masts</b> <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b> This paper compares the flow distortion predicted by the IEC standard and the results of a 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of a triangular <b>lattice</b> <b>mast.</b> Based on the results of wind tunnel and CFD simulation {{it was found that the}} flow distortion surrounding the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> was over predicted by the method suggested in appendix G of IEC 61400 - 12 - 1. Using the CFD data it was possible to determine, for a range of flow directions and mast heights, the distance from the mast that anemometers would need to be in order to be outside the flow distortion field...|$|R
5000|$|The design {{characteristics}} of the South Dakotas closely followed those of the [...] and [...] classes. The {{increase in the number}} of main guns was a continuation of U.S. Navy practice from the beginning of the dreadnought era. Like the Tennessees and Colorados, they would have been fitted with standard bridges <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b> Although Norman Friedman describes the South Dakotas as the ultimate development of the series of U.S. battleships that began with the , they were also a departure in size, speed and intermediate armament from the [...] "Standard Type" [...] that characterized the Nevada through [...] classes. The main restriction imposed on them by the Navy was the ability to pass through the Panama Canal. This was a policy to which capital ship designs were to strictly adhere due to the savings in time when ships needed to travel from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic or vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|Newfoundland was {{initially}} in reserve, {{and was used}} as a training ship as part of the stokers' training establishment , before starting a 20-month reconstruction at Plymouth in 1951. The modernisation was the most extensive of those applied to any Colony or Town-class cruiser in the 1950s with Newfoundland receiving extensive new electrical and fire control systems, a new bridge, comprehensive nuclear spraydown capability <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> particularly for the 960 radar in a similar structure to that later fitted to the cruisers [...] and [...] The integrated 275 and MRS-1 fire control for the 4 twin and 40mm mounts was the most comprehensive fitted to a modernised Royal Navy cruiser but possibly not as reliable as the simpler installations on the cruisers [...] and Belfast. Recommissioned on 5 November 1952, she became flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies, and also served in the Far East. The cabinet of Sri Lanka met on board her during the Hartal of 1953.|$|R
50|$|In 1817, the Nizhny Novgorod Fair, {{one of the}} liveliest in the world, was {{transferred}} to Nizhny Novgorod, and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the trade capital of the Russian Empire. The world's first radio receiver by engineer Alexander Popov and the world's first hyperboloid <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> <b>lattice</b> shell-coverings by engineer Vladimir Shukhov were demonstrated at the All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} height records, the Saint Petersburg TV Tower is {{considered}} as the second-tallest tower after the concrete Ostankino <b>Tower</b> <b>and</b> the tallest <b>lattice</b> <b>tower</b> in Russia, possessing a total height of 326 m. In addition, the Saint Petersburg TV Tower {{ranks as the}} eleventh-tallest lattice tower in the world, the second-tallest television <b>tower,</b> <b>and</b> the tallest <b>lattice</b> television tower {{in the whole of}} the Russian Federation (see list of tallest towers in the world).|$|R
50|$|Titans cantilever-jib arm {{could reach}} 190 ft {{above the surface}} at maximum extension. The crane could lift up to 150 t at an arm radius of 90 ft, or 125 t at 125 ft. Two 75 t {{counterweights}} were used to ballast the load; water ballast tanks could also be used, but this rarely occurred. The crane {{was supported by a}} <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> fitted to a riveted-steel pontoon barge that was 176 ft long, 79 ft wide, and had a depth of 13 ft. The crane was not self-propelled, and required two or three tugboats to manoeuvre her around. Power for lifting and rotating was supplied by a coal-fired boiler supplying three steam generators (two 220 kilowatt generators and a 44 kilowatt auxiliary). The only connection between the crane arm <b>and</b> the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> were drive shafts for the slewing (rotational) motors. Titan had a maximum displacement of 2125 t.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mast crane {{integral}} installation technology {{is one of}} the ten new technologies in the construction field, which are put forward by the ministry of construction and are in key application. It is widely applied in the field of construction engineering. However, at present, the design of the mast crane hoisting is generally based on traditional mechanical model and adopts manual calculation, which is lack of safety and reliability, and the model needs to be perfect. As a result, this paper studies the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> crane hoisting system, explores and improves the traditional mechanical model, <b>and</b> develops the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting aided design system (WGCAD 1. 0), {{in order to meet the}} design requirements. Main content includes: introduction to the development in engineering of the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting crane <b>and</b> the application status in hoisting engineering of computer technology; introduction of the development environment of ViusalBasi 6. 0 and Access database which are used in cad system development of the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting. By using the reasonable <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> lifting design mechanics model, from the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting system designer's perspective, the software adopts Visual Basic 6. 0 development environment and Microsoft Access database as development tools, the design idea of engineering design are simulated...|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the age of sail, {{warships}} retained masts, initially as observation {{posts and}} to observe fall of shot, also holding fire control equipment such as rangefinders, and later as a mounting point for radar and telecommunication antennas, which need to be mounted high up to increase range. Simple pole, <b>lattice,</b> <b>and</b> tripod <b>masts</b> have been used—also, on some past Japanese warships, complex pagoda masts.|$|R
2500|$|From mid-1957 until December 1960, {{the carrier}} {{underwent}} a massive refit and reconstruction in the Netherlands. The work {{was carried out}} by Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, and cost US$27 million. The most visible change was the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck. The size of the angle required that an accessway be built around the starboard side of the island superstructure; the weight acting as a counterbalance for the flight deck's portside overhang. Combined with the fitting of a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror landing aid, these modifications permitted the operation of jet aircraft up to [...] in weight. The carrier's island superstructure was replaced, <b>and</b> a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> was fitted to support the new fire control system and radar suite. The ship's boiler capacity was increased, and internal electricity was converted to AC through the installation of four turbo generators and one diesel generator.|$|R
50|$|In {{the age of}} sail masts were {{required}} to support the sails, and lookouts were posted on them; {{with the advent of}} engine-powered warships masts were retained and used for observation and to spot fall of shot. The purpose of the lattice structure was to make the posts less vulnerable to shells from enemy ships, and to better absorb the shock caused by firing heavy guns, isolating the delicate fire control equipment (rangefinders, etc.) mounted on the mast tops. However, the masts were found to be easily damaged by the inclement weather experienced at sea by naval ships during typhoons and hurricanes: the s mast was bent right down to the deck by such a storm in 1918. As the caliber and range of ships' guns increased, heavier rangefinders {{were required}}. Additionally, the guns and powerful engines created shock <b>and</b> vibrations. <b>Lattice</b> <b>masts</b> were phased out in favor of more rigid tripod masts.|$|R
50|$|Some navies {{considered}} <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> {{for their}} ships. Following {{their experience with}} the Andrei Pervozvannys, the Russians initially designed the four s with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> but constructed with pole ones. The German Imperial Navy designed its first battlecruiser, , with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> but she was instead completed with pole masts.|$|R
50|$|Only four battleships were {{completed}} with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> for other navies. The two s of the Imperial Russian Navy had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> {{until they were}} replaced with conventional masts {{in the beginning of}} the First World War. The two United States-built s of the Argentine Navy, ARA Rivadavia and ARA Moreno, had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b> They were the only dreadnought-type battleships built for export by the USA. Two other battleships, the US pre-dreadnoughts Mississippi and Idaho were sold to Greece in 1914; they retained their <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> until their sinking by the Germans in 1941.|$|R
5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} pole mast above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> added aft, <b>and</b> in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All American battleships, {{up to the}} [...] battleships were {{equipped}} with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> although in the 1920s to 1930s, the older battleships had their <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> replaced with more modern tripod masts, concomitant {{with the addition of}} larger, much heavier fire-control director tops. The newer [...] and [...] classes retained their original <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> of heavier construction than those on earlier ships, at the start of World War II.|$|R
50|$|Royalist was {{converted}} to an escort carrier squadron flagship immediately on completion, when an extra two twin 20 mm were fitted {{as well as}} four single 20 mm. She was the only ship to receive an extensive postwar modernisation ordered for the RN but was later sold to New Zealand. Plans were drawn up to fully modernise the four improved Didos with either four twin 3 inch L70 guns or Mk 6 4.5 inch guns. However, that would have required building new broad beamed Didos (as was seriously considered in 1950-54). This was because the magazines of the Royalist type could hold only enough 3 inch ammunition for 3 minutes and 20 seconds of continuous firing. The refit of Royalist was shortened and that of Diadem abandoned because new steam turbines were regarded as both necessary and unaffordable. Royalist′s reconstruction, like that of Newfoundland, incorporated much of the RN's late 1940s and early 1950s view of a desirable cruiser. Royalist′s 5.25 inch armament was given some of the improvements of the final 5.25 inch mounts built for Vanguard, but not the extra space or power ramming. Also added was a secondary armament of 3 STAAG auto twin 40mm, new 293, 960M radar and Type 275(2 sets) DP fire control for the 5.25 guns, <b>and</b> a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast.</b> (Royalist was loaned to the RNZN in 1956, in exchange for Bellona).|$|R

Modernization also included replacement of earlier 3-inch/50 cal anti-aircraft guns with eight 5-inch/25 caliber guns. Further training exercises followed in September 1933. On 24 October 1934, she passed through the Panama Canal {{on her way back}} to the Pacific Fleet, where she remained through mid-1941, apart from the normal winter cruises in the Caribbean. By this time, World War II had broken out in Europe, spawning the Battle of the Atlantic. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Neutrality Patrols to protect American shipping. On 7 May 1941, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, transferred Mississippi, the battleships [...] and , the aircraft carrier , four light cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons to the Atlantic to reinforce the Neutrality Patrols. On 15 June, Mississippi arrived back in Norfolk, where she prepared to make her first patrol in the North Atlantic, which consisted of escorting a convoy from Newport, Rhode Island to Hvalfjordur, Iceland. She began another convoy escort mission on 28 September, also to Iceland. Mississippi remained there through November to protect American shipping in the area. During this period, she was assigned to the [...] "White Patrol", a special task group, along with the other two battleships and a pair of heavy cruisers.|$|R
