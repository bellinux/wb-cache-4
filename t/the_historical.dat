5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. <b>The</b> <b>Historical</b> Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> articles. The new director of <b>the</b> <b>Historical</b> Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.|$|E

5|$|Shelley uses <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> {{novel to}} comment on gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> record, Shelley uses their {{narratives}} to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
