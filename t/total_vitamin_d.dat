Methods included an updated structured search on Ovid MEDLINE; rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction; and meta-regression (using different model constructs). In particular, priority was given to data from winter-based RCT performed at latitudes > 49 • 58 °N (n 12). A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake (i. e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) versus achieved serum 25 (OH) D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95 % lower CI) serum 25 (OH) D (nmol/l) = 9 • 2 (8 • 5) Ln (<b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D)).</b> Use of non-transformed <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake data (maximum 1400 IU/d; 35 µg/d) provided for a more linear relationship (mean serum 25 (OH) D (nmol/l) = 0 • 044 × (<b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D)</b> + 33 • 035). Although inputting an intake of 600 IU/d (i. e. the RDA) into the 95 % lower CI curvilinear and linear models predicted a serum 25 (OH) D of 54 • 4 and 55 • 2 nmol/l, respectively, the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake that would achieve 50 (and 40) nmol/l serum 25 (OH) D was 359 (111) and 480 (260) IU/d, respectively.

The objective {{of this study was to}} comprehensively evaluate determinants of serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. Data from a subset of the Womens Health Initiative Observational Study were analyzed (50 – 79 y; n = 3345). Information on diet, lifestyle behaviors, secondhand smoke, use of dietary supplements and medication, chronic diseases, and anthropometry was collected at baseline (1993 – 1998) and on sun exposure at year 4 follow-up. Linear regression was performed to estimate regression coefficients (b). Significant determinants were <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake (food plus supplements per 100 IU/d, b = 2. 08), years of supplemental vitamin D use (b = 0. 15), total fat intake (grams per day, b = – 0. 03), smoking status (b = – 2. 64, current vs. never), regional solar irradiance (b = 6. 26, 475 – 500 vs. 300 – 325 Langleys), daylight time spent outdoors in summer (b = 5. 15,> 2 h vs. < 30 min/d), recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task per hour per week, b = 0. 13), waist circumference (centimeters, b = – 0. 26), and race/ethnicity (b = – 11. 94, black vs. white). <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake (partial R 2 = 0. 09) explained the most variance in serum 25 (OH) D concentrations (total R 2 = 0. 29).

40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides.

This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc.

40|$|Background: Past {{studies suggest}} that {{maternal}} vitamin D intake during pregnancy may protect against child wheeze but studies on asthma are limited. Our objective {{was to examine the}} relation between intake of vitamin D in mid-pregnancy and child asthma and allergic rhinitis at 18  months and 7  years. Methods: We examined data from 44, 825 women enrolled during pregnancy in the longitudinal Danish National Birth Cohort (1996 – 2002). We estimated vitamin D intake from diet and supplements based on information from a validated food frequency questionnaire completed in gestational week 25. At 18  months, we evaluated child asthma using data from phone interviews. We assessed asthma and allergic rhinitis by self-report at age 7 and asthma by using records from national registries. Current asthma at age 7 was defined as lifetime asthma diagnosis and wheeze in the past 12  months. We calculated multivariable risk ratios with 95 % CIs comparing highest vs. lowest quintile of vitamin D intake in relation to child allergic disease outcomes. Results: The median (5 %- 95 %ile) intake of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> was 11. 7 (3. 0 - 19. 4) μg/day (68 % from supplements). In multivariable analysis, mothers in the highest (vs. lowest) quintile of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake were less likely to have children classified with current asthma at 7  years (Q 5 vs. Q 1 : 0. 74, 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 96, P[*]=[*] 0. 02) and they were less likely to have children admitted to the hospital due to asthma (Q 5 vs. Q 1 : 0. 80, 95 % CI: 0. 64, 1. 00, P[*]=[*] 0. 05). We found no associations with child asthma at 18  months or with allergic rhinitis at 7  years.

40|$|Various {{populations are}} at {{increased}} risk of developing a low vitamin D status, in particular older adults. Whereas sun exposure is considered the main source of vitamin D, especially during summer, dietary contributions should not be underestimated. This study aims to identify food sources of vitamin D that associate most strongly with serum vitamin D concentration. Data of 595 Dutch adults, aged ≥ 65 years, were analysed. Vitamin D intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) was determined in serum. Associations of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake and vitamin D intake from specific food groups with serum 25 (OH) D status were examined by P-for trend analyses over tertiles of vitamin D intake, prevalence ratios (PRs), and spline regression. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was high, with 36 % of the participants having a 25 (OH) D status < 50 nmol/L. Participants with adequate 25 (OH) D concentrations {{were more likely to be}} men and more likely to be younger than participants with vitamin D deficiency. Total median vitamin D intake was 4. 3 μg/day, of which 4. 0 μg/day was provided by foods. Butter and margarine were the leading contributors to <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake with 1. 8 μg/day, followed by the intake of fish and shellfish with 0. 56 μg/day. Participants with higher intakes of butter and margarine were 21 % more likely to have a sufficient 25 (OH) D status after adjustment for covariates (T 1 vs. T 3 : PR 1. 0 vs. 1. 21 (95 %CI: 1. 03 – 1. 42), P-for trend 0. 02). None of the other food groups showed a significant association with the probability of having a sufficient 25 (OH) D status.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{increasing}} evidence concerning adverse health consequences of low vitamin D levels. We determined {{whether there is}} any surrogate for measuring vitamin D in people older than 70 years and the relation between index of multiple deprivation (IMD) and vitamin D levels. Methods: Blood samples from 241 patients were included in this analysis. Concurrent measurements for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bone profile are reported. Results: The prevalence of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> insufficiency/deficiency (defined as <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> < 50 nmol/L) was 57. 5 % overall. Even for patients with vitamin D deficiency, a significant proportion had PTH, normal calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels. For patients with vitamin D < 25 nmol/L, 62. 7 % had a PTH within reference range, 83. 1 % had normal serum-adjusted calcium, 80. 6 % had normal phosphate, and 85. 1 % had a normal serum alkaline phosphatase. With increasing quintiles of IMD, there was a 22 % increased risk of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency from quintiles 1 to 5, in age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 22, 95 % confidence interval [1. 01, 1. 47]; p =. 034).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Vitamin D {{inhibits}} several pathways of {{lung cancer}} carcinogenesis and cells in the respiratory tract produce and utilize vitamin D. Vitamin D's functions rely on vitamin D receptor together with retinoid X receptor, which ligands with 9 -cis-retinoic acid, a vitamin A (retinol) metabolite. The objectives of this dissertation are to investigate 1) whether high versus low vitamin D intake is associated with lower lung cancer incidence, 2) whether high/excess vitamin A intake attenuates the inverse association of vitamin D intake with lung cancer, and 3) whether vitamin D intake is associated with vitamin D status, represented by serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Data sources were the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trials and Observational Study (WHI-CT and OS), recruiting postmenopausal women mostly former/never smokers, and the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), recruiting male and female current/former heavy smokers and workers with occupational exposure to asbestos. Vitamin D exposure included <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake from food and dietary supplements and 1 g calcium+ 400 IU vitamin D 3 daily supplementation from the WHI Calcium/Vitamin D Trial. Vitamin A exposure included total vitamin A intake from food and dietary supplements and CARET's intervention [...] 30 mg beta-carotene+ 25, 000 IU retinyl palmitate daily supplementation (22, 500 µg/day Retinal Activity Equivalent [RAE]). Results from the WHI-OS showed that <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake was strongly associated with serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations after adjusting for available covariates and sun exposure variables. The vitamin D intake-lung cancer associations were examined separately in the WHI CT+OS and CARET. High (≥ 400 IU/day in WHI and ≥ 600 IU/day in CARET) versus low <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake {{was associated with a}} lower risk {{of lung cancer}}, particularly for non-small cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma, among never smokers in WHI and former smokers in CARET. The patterns of effect modification of vitamin A intake were heterogeneous according to participants' smoking status. Among current smokers (and CARET former smokers, who generally were heavy smokers before quitting), an inverse association of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake with lung cancer was only observed among those with high total vitamin A intake (≥ 3, 000 µg/day RAE in WHI [P-interaction= 0. 26] and ≥ 1, 500 µg/day RAE in CARET [P-interaction= 0. 08]) or receiving the CARET intervention (P-interaction= 0. 24). However, among WHI participants as a whole, high vitamin A intake (≥ 1, 000 µg/day RAE) may attenuate a protective association of 1 g calcium+ 400 IU vitamin D 3 supplementation with lung cancer (P-interaction= 0. 09). The difference in smoking between WHI and CARET may contribute to the discrepant findings on vitamin A effect modification. The findings need further confirmation by biomarkers of vitamin A that reflects internal dose and have less measurement error compared to dietary data.

Five vitamin D metabolites were then isolated using a combination of conventional chromatography on Sephadex LH- 20 and Lipidex 5000 followed by high-performance liquid chromatography. 24, 25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D were measured using binding protein assays and were found to be present at very low levels. These dihydroxylated metabolites do not contribute significantly to the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> activity. Vitamins D and D 3 were found to be present at concentrations of 338 and 41 ng/l, respectively. This is equivalent to 14 to 16 lU/I ofvitamin D activity. Human milk contains 163 ng/l of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, which gives about 33 lU/I of vitamin D activity. Thus 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 accounts for about 75 % of the biological activity observed in the calcium transport assay. Vitamin D 2, vitamin D 3, and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 are responsible for more than 90 % of the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> activity present.

The results suggest 82. 3 % of residents are not consuming enough <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> E to meet their estimated needs. Considering intake of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C, 48. 3 % of male non-smokers, 45. 3 % of female non-smokers, 78. 8 % of male smokers and 73. 6 % of female smokers have inadequate intakes. The intake of no nutrient studied was found to be associated with diabetes status. Residents of the province should be encouraged to consume diets of higher micronutrient density...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} a case of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism. Materials and methods. A female patient aged 51 years sought medical advice for complaints of spinal column and bone pains, periodic dizziness, and hand numbness. The patient underwent clinical and biochemical blood tests, determination of the blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, concentrations of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> calciuria, electrocardiography, thyroid ultrasonography, and neck computed tomography. Results. Based on her complaints, examination evidence, evaluation of the clinical presentations of the disease, and objective and instrumental examination findings, the patient was diagnosed with left parathyroid adenoma and primary hyperparathyroidism; stage II hypertensive disease, grade I, a moderate risk; retinal angiopathy of both eyes; stage I dyscirculatory encephalopathy with liquor and venous dyscirculation and moderate vestibular ataxia; urolithiasis; kidney stones; and spondylosis mainly involving the lumbar spine. The diagnostic determinants for verifying the diagnosis were the results of neck computed tomography, namely: the signs of space-occupying lesion in the projection of the left parathyroid gland; the blood level of parathyroid hormone 118. 6 pg/ml (normal value (N) 9. 5 – 75. 0 pg/ml); <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> 21. 64 nmol/l (N 75 – 250 nmol/l); and calcium 2. 48 mmol/l (N 2. 15 – 2. 50 mmol/l). The history of urolithiasis, repeated lithotripsy, as well as spondylosis with lumboischalgia was an absolute indication for surgical treatment. Conclusion. The practical interest {{in this case is}} due to the complexity of diagnosing normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism after vitamin D deficiency. The early stages of primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic and frequently give rise to irreversible renal complications, causing renal failure and, as a consequence, disability. This clinical case demonstrates the importance of routinely determining vitamin D concentrations, which in turn triggers parathyroid adenomas. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D intake from foods or {{supplements}} is a {{safe and}} attractive means to improve vitamin D status of populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to help identify population subgroups that would benefit most from efforts to increase intake. To do so, we investigated which personal characteristics are associated with vitamin D intake in an Australian population and modeled possible effects of expanded food fortification practices. METHODS: We investigated vitamin D intake in a population-based random sample of 785 adults, using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and assessed associations with personal and behavioral characteristics. We identified vitamin D food sources and modeled the hypothetical effects of blanket fortification of milk and breakfast cereals. RESULTS: Average <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake was 4. 4 (+/- 4. 0) mug/g and below adequate intake for most participants in all age and sex subgroups. Higher intake was associated with being female, having a serious medical condition, energy intake below the median, and vitamin D supplement use (all P < 0. 05). The "meat, fish, and eggs" food group contributed most to <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake (51 %), followed by dairy products and related foods (43 %). If all milk and breakfast cereals were to be fortified with vitamin D, the average intake of vitamin D from foods would increase from 3. 6 (+/- 2. 4) mug/d to 6. 3 (+/- 3. 2) mug/d, with similar increases in all age and sex subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D intake in Australia is generally below recommended levels, and few personal characteristics help to identify subgroups with low intake. Blanket vitamin D fortification of milk and breakfast cereals would substantially increase average vitamin D intake in Australian adults of all ages...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D {{level is}} {{inversely}} associated with tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes (DM). Vitamin D {{could be a}} mediator in the association between TB and DM. We examined the associations between vitamin D, TB and DM. METHODS: Consecutive adults with TB and sex- and age-matched volunteers were included in a case-control study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Glycemia and <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> (25 (OH) D) were measured at enrolment and after TB treatment in cases. The association between low 25 (OH) D (< 75  nmol/l) and TB was evaluated by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, socioeconomic status, sunshine hours, HIV and an interaction between low 25 (OH) D and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: The prevalence of low 25 (OH) D was similar in TB patients and controls (25. 8...|$|E

30|$|Herbert {{proposed}} serum holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) as {{an earlier}} and more sensitive indicator of vitamin B 12 deficiency than <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> B 12 (Herbert 1987, 1994). According to Herbert (1994): “Low concentrations of holoTCII occur before low concentrations of <b>total</b> serum <b>vitamin</b> B- 12 or before deficiency”. This {{is based on}} two properties of HoloTC; the small percentage of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> B 12 existing as HoloTC, and the short half-life of HoloTC. According to Herbert (1994), HoloTC comprises only 20  % of serum <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> B 12; this metabolically active portion is carried to all cells on the transport protein transcobalamin (TC). The remaining 80  % (holohaptocorrin, HoloHC) is the metabolically inert component carried on the liver storage protein haptocorrin (HC). According to Herbert (1994), HoloTC has a short half-life of only 6  min compared to 240  h for HoloHC. There is disagreement about the actual half-life of HoloTC, as discussed later in this review, but {{the consensus is that}} it is far shorter than that of HoloHC.|$|R
40|$|Background:Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{and asthma}} are common at higher latitudes. Although vitamin D has important immunologic effects, its relation with asthma is unknown. Objective:We hypothesized that a higher maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy {{is associated with}} a lower risk of recurrent wheeze in children at 3 y of age. Design:The participants were 1194 mother-child pairs in Project Viva-a prospective prebirth cohort study in Massachusetts. We assessed the maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy from a validated food-frequency questionnaire. The primary outcome was recurrent wheeze, ie, a positive asthma predictive index (2 wheezing attacks among children with a personal diagnosis of eczema or a parental history of asthma). Results:The mean (1 SD) <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake during pregnancy was 548 1 167 IU/d. By age 3 y, 186 children (16...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} used a {{systematic}} review approach to identify relevant randomised control trials (RCT) with vitamin D and then apply meta-regression {{to explore the}} most appropriate model of the vitamin D intake–serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) relationship to underpin setting reference intake values. Methods included an updated structured search on Ovid MEDLINE; rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction; and meta-regression (using different model constructs). In particular, priority was given to data from winter-based RCT performed at latitudes > 49 • 58 °N (n 12). A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake (i. e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) versus achieved serum 25 (OH) D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. More time {{outdoors}} {{is associated}} with a lesser risk of myopia, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) mediates the protective effects of time outdoors against myopia. Methods. We analyzed data for children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) population-based birth cohort: noncycloplegic autorefraction at age 7 to 15 years; maternal report of time outdoors at age 8 years and serum vitamin D 2 and D 3 at age 10 years. A survival analysis hazard ratio (HR) for incident myopia was calculated for children spending a high- versus low-time outdoors, before and after controlling for vitamin D level (N = 3677). Results. <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> and D 3, but not D 2, levels were higher in children who spent more time outdoors (mean [95...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Enteral {{nutritional}} products intended forthe dietary {{management of}} patients and require to beused under medical supervision are specially processedor formulated. These products contain water solubleand fat soluble vitamins. The vitamin C (ascorbic acid) {{which is one of}} the water soluble vitamins is a importantvitamin for many body functions. The aim of this studyis to determine the applicability of UV detection (280 nm) method by the simply, specific and sensitive highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantitativeestimation of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C levels in enteral nutritionalproducts. Method: HPLC method was used for quantitativedetermination of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C in <b>total</b> 28 enteralnutritional products. The chromatographic systemwas done on a C 18 column (250 x 4. 60 mm- 5 μ) with UVdetection at 280 nm. Buffer containing hexanesulphonicacid sodium salt and methanol (98 : 2) was used as themobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. In statisticalevaluation; the relationship between the valuesdetermined for enteral nutrition products and thevalues declared on the labels of the products was madeaccording to independent samples T-Test. Results: HPLC method was used for quantitativedetermination of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C in enteral nutritionalproducts. The values of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C of the productsranged from 3. 9 to 52. 20 mg/ 100 ml. In the statisticalevaluation, it was observed that the values determinedfor enteral nutrition products were similar to the valuesdeclared on the labels of the products (p> 0. 05). Theretention time of vitamin C was determined as ca. fivemin. It was also found that the detection of limit (LOD) is 0. 005 mg/ 100 ml. Conclusion: It was showed that HPLC-UV can beapplied for the quantitative determination of totalvitamin C levels in enteral nutritional products. Thishad the advantages of improved simplicity, sensitivityand shorter application times. Also, it is approved thatthe values of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C declared on the labels ofthese products are accurate...|$|R
