5|$|The {{restaurant}} replaced Leo's Non-Smoking Coffee Shop, {{which was}} owned by Peter and Jane Chan for thirty years. When Leo's closed in February 2014, rumors had already circulated about restaurateur and developer Dayna McErlean's {{plans to open a}} more upscale diner. The Dime Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve breakfast and lunch during mid-week hours, with the potential to later add happy hour and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E
5|$|After {{departing from}} the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures him up to the roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as <b>the</b> <b>Soda</b> Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sodas</b> {{became a}} part of local culture and were, at times, even {{attributed}} mythical qualities: The local hospital used to serve Twin Lights ginger ale to patients, while Twin Lights orangeade gained a reputation as a reliable hangover cure.|$|R
5|$|Other {{characters}} include <b>the</b> <b>Soda</b> Poppers, a {{group of}} three former child stars from the 1970s. The three, each with their own trademark catch-phrase, first appear as victims of hypnosis in the first episode, later acting as the judges on a Pop Idol parody in the second episode. By the fourth episode, they are elected the governors of the Dakotas and plunge the region into civil war over ownership of Mount Rushmore. Also making sporadic appearances is Hugh Bliss, an eccentric magician and leader of the Prismatology cult, a parody of Scientology. He is often seen attempting to promote his self-help guides based on Prismatology. Sam finds Bliss irritating, while Max almost idolizes him. Minor characters include Agent Superball, a US Secret Service agent with a penchant for guarding doors; Chuckles, the pit manager in a mafia-run casino; and the Computer Obsolescence Prevention Society (COPS), {{a group of}} outdated computers attempting to find purpose in the technologically advanced world.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take interest in <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start {{playing with the}} ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and {{increases}} in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> shop, <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the company's decline in sales was that soda fountain operators (also called soda jerks) would give extra blasts of the syrup into the glass before adding <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> water.

50|$|However, {{it was in}} Britain {{that the}} Leblanc process really took off. William Losh built <b>the</b> first <b>soda</b> works in Britain at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works on the River Tyne in 1816, but it {{remained}} {{on a small scale}} due to large tariffs on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, <b>the</b> British <b>soda</b> industry was able to rapidly expand. James Muspratt's chemical works in Liverpool and Charles Tennant's complex near Glasgow became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, <b>the</b> British <b>soda</b> output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.|$|R

25|$|The raw {{material}} used for {{these kinds of}} soap is olive oil. The Tripoli soap is also composed of: honey, essential oils, and natural aromatic {{raw material}}s like flowers, petals, and herbs. The soaps are dried in the sun, in a dry atmosphere, allowing the evaporation of the water that served to mix the different ingredients. The drying operation lasts for almost three months. As the water evaporates, a thin white layer appears on the soap surface, from <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> that comes from the sea salts. The craftsman brushes the soap very carefully with his hand until the powder trace is entirely eliminated.|$|E
25|$|An {{ice cream}} soda is a {{beverage}} {{that consists of}} one or more scoops of ice cream in either a soft drink or a mixture of flavored syrup and carbonated water. Variations of the ice cream soda are as countless as the varieties of soda and flavors of ice cream. An example of ice cream soda is the root beer float. In 1874, the ice cream soda was invented by Robert M. Green of Philadelphia. Green's invention paved the way for <b>the</b> <b>soda</b> fountain industry to flourish and for many new spoon novelties such as ice cream sundaes to be created.|$|E
