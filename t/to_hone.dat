The younger Moore spent his {{childhood}} on the basketball court, playing until nightfall <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> his skills. He attended South Philadelphia High School, the alma mater of basketball players Nate Blackwell and Lionel Simmons. He played on the school basketball team, the Rams, and was coached by George Anderson. As a junior, he was named All-Philadelphia Public League honorable mention.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold {{his interest in the}} pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> his cuemaking abilities.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E

However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. Greg Chappell became {{the coach of the}} Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> Pathan's batting skills, which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} edit {{was almost}} three hours long; <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut {{material from the}} first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to leave it open-ended.|$|E
5|$|The pier was an {{immediate}} success and quickly {{became one of the}} most popular landmarks in Brighton. By 1911, the reading rooms had been converted into a theatre. Both Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin performed at the pier <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> their comic skills early in their career, before migrating to the US and finding major commercial success in Hollywood. During World War I, the sea surrounding the pier was extensively mined to prevent enemy attacks. In the 1920s, the pier was widened, and a distinctive clock tower was added.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} {{and restore the}} Orangery, the Trust teamed-up with City of Bath College and Nimbus Conservation Ltd in an innovative partnership, whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> their skills and carry out the specialist stonework needed. The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a hands-on environment in the skills required to repair the building.

5|$|Chaplin's {{childhood}} in London {{was one of}} poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, {{he was sent to}} a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations.

Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that, against her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. At first, she becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave everyone and everything behind, including Sam, in order <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will be wasted if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

Several works on civic pageantry and some collections of ancient unpublished songs and dialogues were edited by him for the Percy Society in 1842. In 1844 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He published an edition of the dramatic works of John Lyly in 1858.|$|R

5|$|New {{additions}} to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a ranged-grab maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab-with-bare-hands allowing him to use a weak foe as a battering ram. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) during bonus play. The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example, killing all enemies without using weapons before time runs out. The player may unlock additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and the challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> playing skills.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe started 2000 {{looking to}} add a third {{individual}} event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour <b>to</b> <b>hone</b> his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids. Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample {{due to lack of}} containers. After the standoff was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5s from his world short course record in the 200m freestyle. Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.|$|E
