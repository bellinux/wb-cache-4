5|$|Plant <b>thylakoid</b> {{membranes}} {{have the}} largest lipid component of a non-bilayer forming monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG), and little phospholipids; despite this unique lipid composition, chloroplast <b>thylakoid</b> membranes {{have been shown to}} contain a dynamic lipid-bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is also {{important}} in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{is a part of}} photosystem II contained in the <b>thylakoid</b> membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese. To fulfill this requirement, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the <b>thylakoid</b> membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
40|$|Photosystem II is {{vulnerable}} to light damage. The reaction center-binding D 1 protein is impaired during excessive illumination and is degraded and removed from photosystem II. Using isolated spinach <b>thylakoids,</b> we investigated the relationship between light-induced unstacking of <b>thylakoids</b> and damage to the D 1 protein. Under light stress, <b>thylakoids</b> were expected to become unstacked so that the photodamaged photosystem II complexes in the grana and the proteases could move on the <b>thylakoids</b> for repair. Excessive light induced irreversible unstacking of <b>thylakoids.</b> By comparing the effects of light stress on stacked and unstacked <b>thylakoids,</b> photoinhibition of photosystem II {{was found to be}} more prominent in stacked <b>thylakoids</b> than in unstacked <b>thylakoids.</b> In accordance with this finding, EPR spin trapping measurements demonstrated higher production of hydroxyl radicals in stacked <b>thylakoids</b> than in unstacked <b>thylakoids.</b> We propose that unstacking of <b>thylakoids</b> has a crucial role in avoiding further damage to the D 1 protein and facilitating degradation of the photodamaged D 1 protein under light stress...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-fracture {{electron}} microscopy reveals a decreased particle concentration {{on the inner}} fracture face of acclimated <b>thylakoids,</b> suggestive of some alteration(s) in the hydrophobic region. Sonic oscillation causes {{a reversal of the}} altered particle concentration in acclimated <b>thylakoids</b> and suggests that increases in unsaturation of fatty acids can, at most, account for only part of the altered particle concentration. The particles on the inner fracture face of acclimated <b>thylakoids</b> are of one size group (± 140 Å) as compared to two size groups (± 100 Å and ± 165 Å) for nonacclimated <b>thylakoids.</b> The paracrystalline array might be associated with the acclimated state of <b>thylakoids.</b> Nonacclimated <b>thylakoids</b> require 50 mm sucrose for maximum protection of light-dependent proton uptake, while acclimated <b>thylakoids</b> require 25 mm sucrose, and the protection afforded acclimated <b>thylakoids</b> during a freeze-thaw cycle is greater. Sucrose is required for alterations in acclimated <b>thylakoids</b> to be manifested. Apparently increased hardiness is not only associated with changes in cellular environment but also alterations in membranes...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of thylakoids—granal <b>thylakoids,</b> which are {{arranged}} in grana, and stromal <b>thylakoids,</b> which are in contact with the stroma. Granal <b>thylakoids</b> are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal <b>thylakoids</b> are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal <b>thylakoids</b> contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich <b>thylakoid</b> membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant <b>thylakoid</b> membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} thylakoids {{and the total}} <b>thylakoid</b> area of a {{chloroplast}} is influenced by light exposure. Shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more grana with more <b>thylakoid</b> membrane area than chloroplasts exposed to bright light, which have smaller and fewer grana and less <b>thylakoid</b> area. <b>Thylakoid</b> extent can change within minutes of light exposure or removal.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thylakoids</b> {{isolated}} from winter rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) grown at 20 °C (nonhardened rye, RNH) or 5 °C (cold-hardened rye, RH) were characterized using chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence. Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra of RH <b>thylakoids</b> contained emission bands at 680 and 695 nanometers {{not present in}} RNH <b>thylakoids</b> which were interpreted as changes in the association of light-harvesting Chl a/b proteins and photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers. RH <b>thylakoids</b> also exhibited {{a decrease in the}} emission ratio of 742 / 685 nanometers relative to RNH <b>thylakoids...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Thylakoids</b> {{isolated}} from winter rye (Secale cereale L. cv Muskateer) grown at 5 °C or 20 °C {{were compared with}} respect to their capacity to exhibit an increase in light saturated rates of photosystem I (PSI) electron transport (ascorbate/dichlorophenolindophenol → methylviologen) after dark preincubation at temperatures between 0 and 60 °C. <b>Thylakoids</b> isolated in {{the presence or absence of}} Na+/Mg 2 + from 20 °C grown rye exhibited transient, 40 to 60 % increases in light saturated rates of PSI activity at all preincubation temperatures between 5 and 60 °C. This increase in PSI activity appeared to occur independently of the electron donor employed. The capacity to exhibit this in vitro induced increase in PSI activity was examined during biogenesis of rye <b>thylakoids</b> under intermittent light conditions at 20 °C. Only after exposure to 48 cycles (1 cycle = 118 minutes dark + 2 min light) of intermittent light did rye <b>thylakoids</b> exhibit an increase in light saturated rates of PSI activity even though PSI activity could be detected after 24 cycles. In contrast to <b>thylakoids</b> from 20 °C grown rye, <b>thylakoids</b> {{isolated from}} 5 °C grown rye in the presence of Na+/Mg 2 + exhibited no increase in light saturated PSI activity after preincubation at any temperature between 0 and 60 °C. This was not due to damage to PSI electron transport in <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from 5 °C grown plants since light saturated PSI activity was 60 % higher in 5 °C <b>thylakoids</b> than 20 °C <b>thylakoids</b> prior to in vitro dark preincubation. However, a two-fold increase in light saturated PSI activity of 5 °C <b>thylakoids</b> could be observed after dark preincubation only when 5 °C <b>thylakoids</b> were initially isolated in the absence of Na+/Mg 2 +. We suggest that 5 °C rye <b>thylakoids,</b> isolated in the presence of these cations, exhibit light saturated PSI electron transport which may be closer to the maximum rate attainable in vitro than 20 °C <b>thylakoids</b> and hence cannot be increased further by dark preincubation...|$|R
25|$|<b>Thylakoids</b> are membrane-bound {{structures}} {{embedded in}} the chloroplast stroma. A stack of <b>thylakoids</b> is called a granum and resembles a stack of coins.|$|R
25|$|Plastoglobuli {{were once}} thought to be {{free-floating}} in the stroma, but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a <b>thylakoid</b> or to another plastoglobulus attached to a <b>thylakoid,</b> a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the <b>thylakoid</b> network. In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent <b>thylakoid.</b> In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a <b>thylakoid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>thylakoid</b> lumen is a {{continuous}} aqueous phase enclosed by the <b>thylakoid</b> membrane. It {{plays an important}} role for photophosphorylation during photosynthesis. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the <b>thylakoid</b> membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.|$|E
25|$|In the helical <b>thylakoid</b> model, grana {{consist of}} a stack of {{flattened}} circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal <b>thylakoid</b> at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While {{different parts of the}} <b>thylakoid</b> system contain different membrane proteins, the <b>thylakoid</b> membranes are continuous and the <b>thylakoid</b> space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.|$|E
40|$|After proper {{fixation}} with glutaraldehyde, spinach <b>thylakoids</b> retain both photosystem I and photosystem II activity.

40|$|The {{carotenoid}} {{content of}} <b>thylakoids</b> and envelopes isolated from dark-or light-treated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts was compared. In <b>thylakoids,</b> light induced {{a decrease of}} violaxanthin parallel with a stoichiometric increase of zeaxanthin due to violaxanthin deepoxidation. In envelopes, violaxanthin was also decreased and the relative decrease was similar to <b>thylakoids,</b> but zeaxanthin increase was small resulting in an over-all decrease {{of the amount of}} envelope carotenoids. When violaxanthin deepoxidation in <b>thylakoids</b> was partly inhibited by 10 nm nigericin, violaxanthin decrease in the envelope was inhibited to a similar degree...|$|R
25|$|A <b>thylakoid</b> is a membrane-bound {{compartment}} inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. They are {{the site}} of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Thylakoids consist of a <b>thylakoid</b> membrane surrounding a <b>thylakoid</b> lumen. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana (singular: granum). Grana are connected by intergranal or stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.|$|E
25|$|Their chloroplasts do {{not have}} phycobilisomes, {{but they do have}} phycobilin {{pigments}} which they keep in their <b>thylakoid</b> space, rather than anchored on the outside of their <b>thylakoid</b> membranes.|$|E
25|$|Because of the H+ {{gradient}} {{across the}} <b>thylakoid</b> membrane, {{the interior of}} the <b>thylakoid</b> is acidic, with a pH around 4, while the stroma is slightly basic, with a pH of around 8.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{chloroplast}} {{coupling factor}} particles, by the freeze-etching and negative-staining techniques, was made utilizing chloroplast <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from spinach leaves. Complete removal of particles, comparable in diameter to purified coupling factor particles, {{from the outer}} surface of freeze-etched <b>thylakoids</b> was achieved by treatment with 0. 8 % silicotungstate.

40|$|The {{number of}} P 700 (the {{reaction}} centre of Photosystem I) converted to P 700 +, in winter rye, {{was determined by}} measuring the absorbance change at 820 nm. It was found, with a single turnover flash, that <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from cold grown plants have a 50 % greater number of P 700 oxidized than <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from warm grown plants. Incubation of <b>thylakoids</b> in the dark at 35 C did not change the number of P 700 oxidized. The conversion of P 700 to P 700 + with a single flash {{can be compared to}} a steady state rate of electron transport using a Clark electrode. The results for P 700 oxidation using the absorbance change at 820 nm measure effects within the PSI complex whereas the results obtained from a Clark electrode measures steady state electron transport between the cytochrome blf complex and the PSI complex. In contrast to the results for P 700 oxidation it was shown, using a Clark electrode, that both <b>thylakoids</b> from cold grown plants and <b>thylakoids</b> incubated at in the dark 35 C exhibited 50 % higher rates of electron transport than <b>thylakoids</b> from warm grown plants. The correlation between the higher rate of steady state PSI electron transport observed in <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from cold grown winter rye and number of active PSI reaction centres localizes the site of the increase to the PSI reaction centre. In contrast the lack of correlation after incubation at 35 C indicates the increase in the rate of light saturated electron transport in <b>thylakoids</b> isolated from cold grown plants and <b>thylakoids</b> incubated in the dark at 35 C occur by different mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|Embedded in the <b>thylakoid</b> {{membranes}} {{are important}} protein complexes which {{carry out the}} light reactions of photosynthesis. Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy {{and use it to}} energize electrons. Molecules in the <b>thylakoid</b> membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the <b>thylakoid</b> space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the <b>thylakoid</b> space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.|$|E
25|$|The {{electron}} {{transport protein}} plastocyanin {{is present in}} the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I.

Stromal RLSU-bearing particles appear to originate from <b>thylakoids</b> because {{they can also be}} generated in vitro by illumination of isolated <b>thylakoids.</b> Their formation in vitro is largely heat denaturable and is facilitated by light or ATP. RLSU-containing lipid-protein particles range from 0. 05 to 0. 10 [mu]m in radius, contain the same fatty acids as <b>thylakoids,</b> but have a 10 - to 15 -fold higher free-to-esterified fatty acid ratio than <b>thylakoids.</b> RLSU-bearing lipid-protein particles with no detectable RSSU were also immunopurified from the populations of both stromal lipid-protein particles and those generated in vitro from illuminated <b>thylakoids.</b> Protease shaving indicated that the RLSU is embedded in the lipid-protein particles and that there is also a protease-protected RLSU in <b>thylakoids.</b> These observations collectively indicate that the RLSU associated with <b>thylakoids</b> is released into the stroma by light-facilitated blebbing of lipid-protein particles.
