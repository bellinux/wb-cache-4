25|$|While not {{commenting on}} {{the reasons for the}} {{charging}} decisions as to any other persons, we can say that the reasons why Mr. Libby was not charged with an offense directly relating to his unauthorized disclosures of classified information regarding Ms. Wilson included, but were not limited to, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Libby's false testimony obscured a confident determination of what in fact occurred, particularly where the accounts of the reporters with whom Mr. Libby spoke (and their notes) did not include any explicit evidence specifically proving that Mr. Libby knew that Ms. Wilson was a covert agent. On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E
2500|$|Penny {{offers the}} words [...] "potato, bathroom, lust, honeymoon, and sex." [...] Penny reads Mr. Kirby's list first, with {{reactions}} of, respectively: [...] "steak, toothpaste, unlawful, trip, male." [...] Mrs. Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. [...] "Starch" [...] is her response to potatoes, {{which is not}} that bad, but her response for [...] "bathroom" [...] is [...] "Mr. Kirby," [...] and she covers it up with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kirby {{spends a lot of}} time in there [...] "bathing and shaving". Her response to [...] "lust" [...] is [...] "human," [...] claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr. Kirby disagrees, saying [...] "it is depraved." [...] "Honeymoon"'s reply is [...] "dull," [...] as Mrs. Kirby explains that there was [...] "nothing to do at night." [...] The shocker comes when Mrs. Kirby says her reply to [...] "sex" [...] was [...] "Wall Street". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr. Kirby [...] "You're always talking about Wall Street, even when--" [...] and then stops.|$|E
2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patton first {{alluded to}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bungle would {{probably}} not record any more albums in 2003, stating in an interview, [...] "I think it is over. The guys are spread {{all over the world}} and we don't talk to each other. I have not spoken to a couple of the guys since the last tour, years ago." [...] Patton reiterated this sentiment in another 2003 interview with Australian newspaper The Age. While no official break-up announcement ever materialized, a 2004 Rolling Stone interview confirmed Mr. Bungle had disbanded with Patton revealing, “We could have probably squeezed out a couple more records but the collective personality of this group became so dysfunctional, this band was poisoned by one person's petty jealousy and insecurity, and it led us to a slow, unnatural death. And I'm at peace with that, because I know I tried all I could.” When asked about a possible reunion, Mike Patton said, [...] "It could happen, but I won’t be singing. Some bridges have definitely been burned. It was a fun time and sometimes you just have to move on. I’ve got a lot on my plate now." [...] Trevor Dunn added on his website, [...] "Bungle is dead and I'm happy about it" [...] and that [...] "the members of Mr. Bungle will never work together as such again". Spruance, Heifetz, and McKinnon have been more optimistic regarding a possible reunion.|$|E
2500|$|When the ICTY {{indictment}} {{was issued}} in March 2005, Haradinaj chose {{to step down}} immediately from his position as Prime Minister. The following day he travelled voluntarily to The Hague where he submitted himself to {{the custody of the}} court and remained for two months until he was granted provisional release pending trial. The head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) during this time, Søren Jessen-Petersen, welcomed the decision Haradinaj to face the tribunal voluntarily, praised his work and described Haradinaj as a [...] "close partner and friend", regardless Western intelligence reports that Haradinaj was a key figure in the range between organized crime and politics. [...] Citing Mr. Haradinaj's compliance with the ICTY {{and the fact that he}} posed no risk of flight and no risk towards witnesses, the Trial Chamber of the ICTY extended his provisional release and allowed him to wait for trial in his hometown of Prishtina. Further, the Appeals Chamber later granted Haradinaj the unprecedented right for an indictee to engage in public political activity. Such activity was, however, subject to the approval of UNMIK. This step was unprecedented in the history of international criminal law and seen as a reflection of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Haradinaj voluntarily submitted himself to the court. Critics (and the prosecution) however, argued that this went too far. The Prosecution argued that although Mr. Haradinaj posed no threat to witnesses, his mere presence in Kosovo could have a “chilling” effect on whether witnesses would testify.|$|E
60|$|The short {{sketch of}} the Ambroses was, however, {{somewhat}} perfunctory, and contained little but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ambrose was her uncle.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, he had {{sufficient}} {{of the artist}} soul to resent <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Porter was standing a great deal {{too close to the}} masterpiece to get its full value.|$|R
60|$|From which expression, {{and from}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Lupex {{depended}} greatly upon her stays and crinoline for such figure as she succeeded in displaying, it may, perhaps, be understood <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Cradell {{did not understand}} much about form.|$|R
6000|$|Kindly Tom Poppins {{worked in}} a cigar-store and was {{accustomed}} to talk back to drunken men six feet tall. His voice was tremendous, and he was fatly immovable; he didn't a bit mind <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Zapp was still [...] "glaring speechless." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lydgate {{had really}} {{lost sight of}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Chichely was his Majesty's coroner, and ended innocently with the question, [...] "Don't you agree with me, Dr. Sprague?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far from it," [...] he responded. [...] "I'm in a {{receptive}} mood. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bartol {{has found}} enough in this subject to wish to investigate predisposes me to open-mindedness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What will he deny next?” asked Mrs. Greyes {{under her}} breath. What {{made it seem}} so much worse was <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Scarrick had quite {{recently}} presided at a lecture on Savonarola.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2015 that the BBC wanted O'Carroll to do [...] "other stuff", due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Brown's Boys had become so successful. He revealed plans to adapt his first ever written play, The Course into a television sitcom.|$|R
6000|$|It {{may have}} been <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Swiftwaite's friend {{remained}} to Kennicott an ill-told rumor, it {{may have been}} Carol's voice, wistful in the pallid evening as she sang to Hugh, {{it may have been}} natural and commendable virtue, but certainly he was positive: ...|$|R
6000|$|McFarlane {{was again}} {{called to the}} telephone.

6000|$|... "So you {{see what}} it amount to, Jeeves. We want you to suggest some way by which Mr. Worple can make Miss Singer's {{acquaintance}} without getting on to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Corcoran already knows her. Understand?" ...|$|E
60|$|I have, above, made {{a passing}} {{reference}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Darwin did {{not fail to}} take account of some among these effects directly produced on organisms by surrounding inorganic agencies.

6000|$|When Mr. Clemens {{arrived from}} Europe in 1895 {{one of the}} first [...] things he did was to see the dramatization of Pudd'nhead [...] Wilson. The {{audience}} becoming aware of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> [...] Clemens was in the house called upon him for a speech.|$|E
60|$|In a few brief words, he {{summed up}} {{the result of the}} post-mortem. Shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it {{amounted}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one grain or slightly over.|$|R
6000|$|... "The major," [...] he said, [...] "has perhaps had {{sufficient}} fishing, or his precipitation {{may be due}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Kinnaird is not in some respects a friend of yours. I'm rather surprised that Miss Stirling, who must have known it, mentioned the other little matter. Anyway, as you may feel inclined to point out, that's not my business.

6000|$|Lizzie {{suddenly}} found a difficulty in describing {{to her friend}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Carbuncle was endeavouring to turn {{her out of the}} house, without also alluding to her own troubles about the robbery. [...] "She has actually told me," [...] she continued, [...] "that I must leave the house without a day's warning. But I believe the truth is, that she has run so much into debt that she cannot remain." ...|$|R
6000|$|We do {{not mean}} to assert that the {{application}} of this brevity to himself, struck exactly that indignation to Mr. Pickwick's soul, which it would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast.

60|$|Little biographical {{interest}} {{attaches to}} it, beyond <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Longfellow {{found in the}} descriptions and general atmosphere of the book a decided suggestion of the situation of Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, Maine, and the life {{there at the time}} when he and Hawthorne were both undergraduates of that institution.|$|E
6000|$|... [This {{story is}} told by Mr. Richard Colesworthy, an attorney-at-law, in a large town {{in one of our}} Eastern States. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Colesworthy is a {{practical}} man, and but little given, outside of his profession, to speculative theorizing, adds a weight to his statements which they might not otherwise possess.] ...|$|E
5000|$|The name Thalatta is the anglicized {{version of}} the Greek word θάλαττα, meaning [...] "the sea". It is {{interesting}} to note that a yacht named Thalassa was built in Cowes in the same year as the Thalatta, 1906. Thalassa (θάλασσα) is an alternative form of the same Greek word. A possible explanation of this apparent case of synchronicity is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Baillie Reynolds published a highly popular novel named Thalassa in the same year.|$|R
60|$|Much disturbed, {{the three}} youths {{returned}} to the house, where Roger put his map and papers {{in a safe place}} in his trunk--the one he was to take on the trip West. In the meantime Dave telephoned to the police, telling them that Merwell had been seen {{in the vicinity of the}} Wadsworth mansion. He was glad of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wadsworth and <b>the</b> girls had gone out to do some shopping, for he did not wish to alarm them further.|$|R
60|$|For {{some weeks}} after the party at Mrs. Armitage's house, and the {{subsequent}} explanations with her mother, Florence was made to suffer many things. First came the one week before they started, which was perhaps the worst of all. This was specially embittered by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mountjoy absolutely refused to divulge her plans as they were made. There was still a fortnight before she could be received at Brussels, and as to that fortnight she would tell nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's nonsense, Miss Cass, and I shall," [...] said Lady Mabel. They were together, on {{the morning}} after the little dinner-party {{described}} in the last chapter, in a small back sitting-room which was supposed to be Lady Mabel's own, and the servant had just announced <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Tregear was below.|$|E
6000|$|D'Alcacer made {{no answer}} and only {{wondered}} whether he didn't like better Mr. Travers' other, unreasonable mood. There was no denying <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Travers was a troubling person. Now he suddenly gripped d'Alcacer's fore-arm and added under his breath: [...] "I doubt everything. I doubt whether the offer {{will ever be}} made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you, though? Was {{not that}} rather green of you?" [...] This did seem strange to Mark. Could it really be <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sowerby {{had so many}} bills flying about that he had {{absolutely}} forgotten that occurrence in the Gatherum Castle bedroom? And then to be called green by the very man whom he had obliged! ...|$|E
60|$|After he had {{sat with}} his arms on the table--he resented <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bower put no cloth on for him, {{and gave him a}} little plate, instead of a {{full-sized}} dinner-plate--he began to eat. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his wife was ill, that he had another boy, was nothing to him at that moment. He was too tired; he wanted his dinner; he wanted to sit with his arms lying on the board; he did not like having Mrs. Bower about. The fire was too small to please him.|$|R
500|$|Downey reentered {{the fray}} on May 22, {{when he made}} a statewide radio address on behalf of Boddy, stating his belief that Douglas was not {{qualified}} to be a senator. He concluded, [...] "Her record clearly shows very little hard work, no important influence on legislation, and almost nothing {{in the way of}} solid achievement. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Douglas has continued to bask in the warm glow of publicity and propaganda should not confuse any voter as to what <b>the</b> real <b>facts</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{hearing that}} letter read and {{in view of}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Burrows is dead, I think not. The letter, if authentic, clears up the mystery to our {{complete}} satisfaction. But I must get the story from Hathaway's own lips, and then compare his statement with that in the letter. If they agree, we won't prosecute the man at all, and the famous case that has caused us so much trouble for years will be filed in the office pigeonholes and pass into ancient history." ...|$|R
