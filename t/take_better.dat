Sometime between his {{deposition}} and his death the widow of King Edward and sister of King Harold, Edith of Wessex, visited him in his imprisonment and allegedly told him to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of himself. He {{was buried in the}} Old Minster at Winchester.|$|E
5|$|Sumartini (abbreviated as Tini) is Tono's ultra-modern wife. While in university, she {{was very}} popular and enjoyed partying. During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono, an act which is viewed as {{unacceptable}} in traditional Indonesian culture; when Hartono left her, Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men. After marrying Tono, she felt increasingly lonely and became involved in social work {{as an effort to}} give her life meaning. After learning of Tono's infidelity and seeing that Yah could <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of him, Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E

25|$|About 2000, Eastlake, Ohio, {{resident}} Michelle A. Day began pressing {{city officials}} to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of Woodland Cemetery. At first, Day worked alone, volunteering to straight headstones, lobbying local funerary monument companies to donate new markers for famous people, and visiting city archives to develop her own database of Woodland's burials. By 2003, {{a small group}} of volunteers had formed around Day to help maintain the cemetery and act as advocates for it.|$|E
25|$|In 1788 {{the colony}} of New South Wales of Australia was founded. The colony {{included}} most of New Zealand {{except for the}} southern half of the South Island. Formed two years prior in London, the New Zealand Company announced in 1839 its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand. The continuing lawlessness of the informally established Australian and European settlers spurred the British to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> control of the colony which until then they had largely ignored, having concentrated mainly on managing Australia.|$|E

25|$|Several months later, on January 28, 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai. Helen was in {{the battle}} area and used to watch the action from the tower at her apartment. Edgar {{was in the}} midst of the battle. However, because of his {{foreigner}} status, he was able to observe the action up close with a lesser amount of risk. Helen too wanted to experience battle in person and <b>take</b> <b>better</b> pictures of the war. Ed helped her to get a press card, and Helen was on her way to becoming a war correspondent herself.|$|E
25|$|In March 1958, the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) {{took over}} the {{planning}} and construction of Canberra. Under {{the control of the}} NCDC new districts, such as Woden and Tuggeranong, were established and slowly developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s to accommodate a growing population. The original design for Canberra did not extend beyond the central suburbs, and thus it was possible to design them to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of the land contours. Woden was established in 1964, Belconnen in 1967 and Tuggeranong in 1973. These additional districts helped to encourage large population growth between 1960 and 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{situation of the}} country was quite difficult at the time. When Colbert became minister he believed that domestic and international trade was not in favour of the Kingdom of France. The Dutch could <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of trade and economic activity in the country. The prices of Grain dropped a lot and wine production fell in 1660. This crisis caused depreciation of land values and small farms were going bankrupt. In addition, the region of Languedoc experienced religious conflict during the Fronde. It was difficult to implement a policy in this area and in particular to introduce taxes such as the salt tax.|$|E

25|$|Palomino was {{the first}} K7 core to include the full SSE {{instruction}} set from the Intel Pentium III, as well as AMD's 3DNow! Professional. It is roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird at the same clock speed, {{thanks in part to}} the new SIMD functionality and to several additional improvements. The core has enhancements to the K7's TLB architecture and added a hardware data prefetch mechanism to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of available memory bandwidth. Palomino was also the first socketed Athlon officially supporting dual processing, with chips certified for that purpose branded as the Athlon MP. According to articles posted on HardwareZone, it was possible to mod the Athlon XP to function as an MP by connecting some fuses on the OPGA, although results varied with the motherboard used.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} <b>take</b> <b>better</b> {{advantage}} of passenger traffic, Boeing {{decided that it}} needed a larger aircraft that was more suitable for passenger carrying, and in early 1928 designed a trimotor aircraft capable of carrying 12 passengers, the Model 80. Unlike the Fokker F.VII and Ford Trimotors operated by other airlines, the Model 80 was a biplane, chosen to give good takeoff and landing performance when operating from difficult airfields on its routes, {{many of which were}} at relatively high altitude. The fuselage was of fabric covered steel and aluminium tube construction, and carried its 12 passengers in three-abreast seating in a well-appointed cabin. The flight crew of two sat in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin. The wings were of fabric covered steel and duralumin construction, with detachable wingtips to aid storage in hangars.|$|E
25|$|The Heroninos Archive is {{the name}} given to a huge {{collection}} of papyrus documents, mostly letters, but also including {{a fair number of}} accounts, which come from Roman Egypt in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private estate is named after Heroninos because he was phrontistes (Koine Greek: manager) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers. Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus scroll into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> economic decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.|$|E

In {{the years following}} the premiere, Puccini made modifications to the three operas, but Gianni Schicchi required few. The principal change was to Rinuccio's arioso, [...] "Avete torto", which was set in a higher pitch to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of the tenor voice.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{synthesis}} avoids many of {{the problems}} of the image parameter method. [...] Not only does it <b>take</b> <b>better</b> account of the terminal impedances but the designer has additional degrees of freedom allowing improved matching. [...] The size and gaps of the teeth are tapered in this method of design. [...] That is, the teeth can be different sizes according to their position in the filter, compared with an image design where all sections are identical. [...] With this approach, the original specification for passband and stopband can be kept while simultaneously improving the impedance matching. [...] The stepped impedance transformers can be dispensed with, or at least significantly reduced in size.|$|E
500|$|Production of the 757 {{peaked at}} an annual rate of 100 {{aircraft}} in the early 1990s, during which time upgraded models came under consideration. For over a decade, the narrow-body twinjet had been its manufacturer's only single-aisle airliner without a stretched variant, and while rumors of a long-range [...] and stretched [...] persisted, no formal announcements had been made. European charter carriers were particularly interested in a higher-capacity version which could <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of the 757's range. Besides meeting the needs of charter customers, a larger model would enable Boeing to match the passenger lift capabilities of the [...] with lower operating costs, and counter longer-range versions of the 185-seat Airbus A321, a new stretched variant of the A320 narrow-body airliner.|$|E

500|$|In 1785, {{fifteen years}} after she wrote her plea for female {{household}} education, Rückerschöld published [...] ( [...] "A Small Household Book"). It was published in her own name, and contains various practical advice on efficient household management; cooking, cleaning, washing, brewing, butchering, etc. Rückerschöld {{was influenced by the}} mercantilistic economic ideas of her time, and advised readers to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> advantage of local produce, such as berries and mushrooms and using locally available products in favor of imports, such as substitution of wine with juice or vinegar made from homegrown fruit. There are few actual recipes for cooking, and all of them describe more everyday dishes such as simpler porridge and soup. For more refined cooking, Rückerschöld recommended other contemporary cookbooks, of which Cajsa Warg's is described as the foremost.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of his health, and he grudgingly {{followed}} their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, Ruth entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed {{that he had an}} inoperable malignant tumor {{at the base of his}} skull and in his neck. The malady was a lesion known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or [...] "lymphoepithelioma." [...] His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. Having lost , he was discharged from the hospital in February and went to Florida to recuperate. He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, Happy Chandler (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000.|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
