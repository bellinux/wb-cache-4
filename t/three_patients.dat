All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care.

40|$|Aims To assess {{changes in}} {{reticulocyte}} impedance volume, conductivity and light scatter (reticulocyte population data or RPD) obtained with the volume, conductivity and laser light scatter (VCS) technology in healthy subjects {{and in different}} erythropoietic states. Methods Blood samples were analysed with the BeckmaneCoulter LH 750 system, using the VCS method, {{from a group of}} 40 healthy subjects and <b>three</b> groups of <b>patients</b> with different types of untreated or treated anaemia: 24 cases of iron deficiency at the time of diagnosis, 16 patients with iron deficiency anaemia during intravenous iron administration, and 57 patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and administration of rHu-erythropoietin and intravenous iron. Results RPD data were reproducible. Average mean channels for volume were 50. 9 for controls and 49. 2, 55. 7 and 64. 0 for the <b>three</b> <b>patient</b> groups, respectively. Average mean channels for conductivity were 52. 0 for controls and 59. 8, 55. 7 and 56. 1 for the <b>three</b> <b>patient</b> groups. Average mean channels for light scatter were 108. 4 for controls and 113. 3, 117. 3 and 128. 2 for the <b>three</b> <b>patient</b> groups. SD data indicated increased dispersion in the patient groups. Conclusion When values in the patient groups are compared with reference values obtained in healthy controls, the main differences are found in impedance volume and light scatter, which were both increased in patients with stimulated erythropoiesis. These data indicate the opportunity to further evaluate the clinical usefulness of RPD in haematological diseases...|$|R

25|$|On 14 September, the National Ebola Response Center {{confirmed}} {{the death of}} a 16-year-old in a village in the Bombali district. Swabs taken from the body tested positive for the disease. The village was placed under quarantine. She had no history of traveling outside the village, and it is suspected that she contracted the disease from the semen of an Ebola survivor who was discharged in March 2015. Seven of her immediate contacts were taken to an Ebola treatment center, with a further <b>three</b> <b>patients</b> she had contact with at a health clinic. A new study to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates the possibility that the virus may lurk in the semen of survivors for up to six months. Nearly half of 200 patients tested had traces of the virus in their semen six months after surviving the disease. On 7 November, the World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone Ebola-free.|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in her left eye. The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was voriconazole 200mg, twice a day for two months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and rhinitis. The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with rhinitis. All seven individuals with rhinitis acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of <b>three</b> <b>patients</b> in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the collection process, S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E
