5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E

50|$|Thin film {{composites}} membranes typically {{suffer from}} compaction effects under pressure. As the water pressure increases, the polymers are slightly reorganized into a <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> structure {{that results in}} a lower porosity, ultimately limiting {{the efficiency of the}} system designed to use them. In general, the higher the pressure, the greater the compaction.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{development}} of the Minié ball {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, the main disadvantages of a rifle compared to a musket were a slower reload time due to the use of a <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> lead ball and greater susceptibility to the fouling of the bore after prolonged use - such fouling would eventually prevent loading altogether, rendering the weapon useless until thoroughly cleaned. The adoption of the Minié ball essentially nullified these disadvantages and allowed the rifle to completely replace the musket.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] is an {{ellipsoid}} containing the object. Ellipsoids usually provide <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> than a sphere. Intersections with ellipsoids are done by scaling the other object along the principal axes of the ellipsoid by an amount {{equal to the}} multiplicative inverse of the radii of the ellipsoid, thus reducing the problem to intersecting the scaled object with a unit sphere. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid problems if the applied scaling introduces skew. Skew can make the usage of ellipsoids impractical in certain cases, for example collision between two arbitrary ellipsoids.|$|R

25|$|Visibility: Pilot {{visibility}} may be poorer due to {{the width}} of the engine on single-engine aircraft, although <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> cowlings helped reduce this factor somewhat. Equivalent inline engines often resulted in overly long noses, which similarly impaired visibility directly forward.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{were used}} in women’s gowns for {{emphasizing}} the small waist of the female body. They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> waist would be shown.|$|E

25|$|The road {{began as}} a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and mortar were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with <b>tight</b> <b>fitting,</b> {{interlocking}} stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together. The road was cambered in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches {{on either side of}} the road which were protected by retaining walls.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of female figures in ancient Indian sculptures are devoid of a blouse, there are several instances of ancient Indian women wearing bras. The first historical reference to bras in India is found during the rule of King Harshavardhana (1st century AD). Sewn bras and blouses were very much in vogue during the Vijayanagara empire and the cities brimmed with tailors who specialized in <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> of these garments. The half-sleeved tight bodice or kanchuka figures prominently {{in the literature of}} the period, especially Basavapurana (1237 AD), which says kanchukas were worn by young girls as well.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the general meaning of [...] "jacket", the word kurtka refers to the garment normally worn by Sambo practitioners, similar to the keikogi in style and function, although it is <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> and has epaulettes and belt loops. A kurtka should be made of canvas or other heavy material, should be tight-fitting, should not extend more than eight inches below the belt (roughly equal {{to the bottom of}} the sleeve) and the sleeves must be long enough to cover the arms to the wrists, and wide enough at the end to fit the wrist and four fingers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{black powder}} used in flintlocks would quickly foul the barrel, {{which was a}} problem for rifles and for smooth bore weapons that fired a <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> round for greater accuracy. Each shot would add more fouling to the barrel, making the weapon more and more {{difficult}} to load. Even if the barrel was badly fouled, the flintlock user still had to properly seat the round {{all the way to the}} breech of the barrel. Leaving an air gap in between the powder and the round (known as [...] "short starting") was very dangerous, and could cause the barrel to explode.|$|R
5000|$|Both tools {{can be used}} {{to clean}} up a thread, which is called chasing. However, using an {{ordinary}} tap or die to clean threads will generally result in the removal of some material, which will result in looser and weaker threads. Because of this, threads are typically cleaned using special taps and dies made for this purpose, which are known as [...] "chasers". Chasers are made of softer materials and are not capable of cutting new threads, however they are still <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> than actual fasteners and are fluted like regular taps and dies (to provide a means for debris like dirt and rust to escape). One particularly common use is for automotive spark plug threads, which often suffer from corrosion and a buildup of carbon.|$|R
25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> chromed units, that carefully followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|E

50|$|During {{the period}} when Raffles became the Governor of Java, he changed the style of social {{interaction}} in the Batavian society. Raffles disapproved the relaxed dress code of the Dutch where many men wear Javanese attire. Raffles and his wife Olivia introduced the custom of wearing a European style dress, but with much white because of the tropical climate, in both men and women. When the British left Batavia in 1815, most of the native people reverted to their original Javanese attire, but some of these new aspects persisted. The native males that was chosen to be the governing elite would wear a European outfit on duty, but after hours they would change to wearing sarong and kebaya. Lower ranked Dutchmen might use the local style all day. Women would wear sarongs and kebaya even to official events, where they would wear <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> robes or richly colored or flowered cloth {{in the style of}} British India, and batik shawls.|$|R
5000|$|In today's hockey game, gloves will {{generally}} {{fall into two}} types of categories, the first being the traditional four-roll style. These types of gloves have more room on the inside, giving it a looser feel on the hand than the natural fit gloves. Hockey players who choose the four-roll style have less resistance in their fingers and hands, so wearing the gloves feels less noticeable. The other category of gloves are the <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting,</b> natural or anatomical fit glove. These have a much tighter fit than the four-roll gloves, and are designed to become {{an extension of the}} players' hand. The tapered gloves are tight on the hand, but ergonomically designed for better wrist mobility and range of motion. Hockey gloves also range in sizes, and are generally available in three categories: Youth size hockey gloves run 8", 9"and 10"; Junior sizes are 11" [...] and 12"; and Senior sizes run 13", 14" [...] and 15".|$|R

2500|$|By 1870, {{fullness}} in {{the skirt}} {{had moved to}} the rear, where elaborately draped overskirts were held in place by tapes and supported by a bustle. [...] This fashion required an underskirt, which was heavily trimmed with pleats, flounces, rouching, and frills. [...] This fashion was short-lived (though the bustle would return again in the mid-1880s), and was succeeded by a tight-fitting silhouette with fullness as low as the knees: the cuirass bodice, a form-fitting, long-waisted, boned bodice that reached below the hips, and the princess sheath dress. Sleeves were very <b>tight</b> <b>fitting.</b> Square necklines were common.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the external auditory canal either by <b>tight</b> <b>fitting</b> diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound elastography imaging {{is being}} {{increasingly}} used {{to indicate the}} functional properties of musculoskeletal pathologies. Usually, this involves a real-time free-hand acquisition which has questionable consistency and {{does not provide a}} material deformation that is representative of the material function. This paper presents a novel method for acquiring quantitative ultrasound lateral strain images of in-vivo Achilles tendons in a controlled manner using a computer controlled foot articulation device and a novel 2 D multiscale, multi-compression, sub-pixel precision block matching algorithm. The method has been applied to a longitudinal study of 21 patients with Achilles tendon rupture which have repeated data points taken over 24 weeks of therapy. The controlled lateral motion results are compared to the more conventional freehand axial-decompression method, and also against clinical measures. The results show that the controlled lateral motion strain images have a smaller standard deviation of average value than the freehand decompression motion (σ lat 0. 77 %, σ comp 1. 74 %) and a <b>tighter</b> <b>fitting</b> to a strain improvement model which followed the same form as clinical measures of patient healing over the group (R 2 lat 0. 78, R 2 comp 0. 34). © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
