40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that arterial stiffness may be determined not only by age(ing) and blood pressure, but also by exposure to other cardiovascular risk factors. This chapter reviews the evidence provided by studies adopting an aetiological model of analyses of determinants of arterial stiffness, mainly derived, if available, from prospective designs. Specifically, the following risk factors are examined: the critical axis (central) obesity – metabolic syndrome – (type 2) diabetes, and also smoking. There is convincing evidence, reinforced by recent aetiological prospective studies, that <b>these</b> risk <b>factors,</b> all {{of which may be}} preventable, increase arterial stiffness. This may explain, at least in part, the increased cardiovascular disease risk observed in these conditions. However, the molecular basis of greater arterial stiffness associated with <b>these</b> risk <b>factors</b> remains to be fully elucidated. In addition, the prognostic significance of arterial stiffness indices in individuals with <b>these</b> risk <b>factors,</b> {{and the extent to which}} intervention on <b>these</b> risk <b>factors</b> improves cardiovascular outcome through beneficial impact on arterial stiffness, is still unclear. Given the high and/or increasing prevalence of <b>these</b> risk <b>factors,</b> <b>these</b> issues constitute an important research agenda...|$|R
