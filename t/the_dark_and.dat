The film received generally positive reviews for its action sequences, acting, Danny Elfman's score, effects, and villains, though <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> depressing tone was heavily criticized.|$|E
5|$|Due to the stuffy {{atmosphere}} and vapors in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym {{runs out of}} water. In {{the course of his}} ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a {{mesquite}} thicket. While working their way back towards the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey.

5|$|After {{attending}} a theatre show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing {{from a dark}} alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. Morgan was struck in the right side. The bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of <b>the</b> <b>Dark,</b> <b>and</b> The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E

5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E

5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b> <b>And</b> it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|Rated R: Remixed {{received}} a mixed review from Jean Goon for MSN Entertainment. She praised Fu for remixing some of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> sombre songs into upbeat dance songs, but criticized the album {{as it did}} not provide memorability. The album peaked at number four in Greece and number six on the US Dance/Electronic Albums chart; it peaked at number 33 on the US Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 158 on the US Billboard 200 chart. As of July 2010, Rated R: Remixed has sold 13,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{became more}} popular after the Beatles used it on several tracks. It was {{subsequently}} {{adopted by the}} Moody Blues, King Crimson and Genesis, and became a notable instrument in progressive rock. Later models such as the M400, the best selling model, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls {{in order to be}} used by touring musicians. The instrument became less popular in the 1980s due to the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite a number of high-profile uses from Orchestral Manoeuvres in <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>and</b> XTC.|$|E

5|$|The Peak District is an upland area in England at the {{southern}} end of the Pennines. It is mostly in northern Derbyshire, but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. An area of great diversity, it is split into the northern Dark Peak, where most of the moorland is found and the geology is gritstone, {{the southern}} White Peak, where most of the population lives and the geology is mainly limestone, and the South West Peak, with landscapes similar to both <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>and</b> White Peaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} not a {{significant}} commercial success but received widespread critical praise and has since become a cult classic. It was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by video game journalists to be the best role-playing game of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release, with a source port version of Torment released on April 11, 2017 by Beamdog.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop out of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented {{with the idea of}} putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
