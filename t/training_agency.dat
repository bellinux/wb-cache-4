25|$|The {{basic problem}} with {{estimating}} a gas allowance for contingencies {{is to decide}} what contingencies to allow for. This is addressed in the risk assessment for the planned dive. A commonly considered contingency is to share gas with another diver from {{the point in the}} dive where the maximum time is needed to reach the surface or other place where more gas is available. It is likely that both divers will have a higher than normal RMV during an assisted ascent as it is a stressful situation. It is prudent to take this into account. The values should be chosen according to recommendations of the code of practice in use or the <b>training</b> <b>agency,</b> but if a higher value is chosen it is unlikely that anyone would object. Recreational divers may have the discretion to use RMV values of their own choice, based on personal experience and informed acceptance of risk.|$|E
25|$|Region-wide {{accreditation}} {{has also}} been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification, which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National <b>Training</b> <b>Agency,</b> the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional certification scheme that awards the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ), which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications. The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the certification scheme of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme. At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which {{was approved by the}} Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006. It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place). This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.|$|E

25|$|Many skills {{which are}} {{considered}} advanced by recreational <b>training</b> <b>agencies</b> are considered basic entry-level skills for professional divers.|$|R
500|$|To {{prevent the}} excess {{formation}} of bubbles {{that can lead}} to decompression sickness, divers limit their ascent rate—the recommended ascent rate used by popular decompression models is about [...] per minute—and carry out a decompression schedule as necessary. This schedule requires the diver to ascend to a particular depth, and remain at that depth until sufficient gas has been eliminated from the body to allow further ascent. Each of these is termed a [...] "decompression stop", and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops, or none at all. Dives that contain no decompression stops are called [...] "no-stop dives", but divers usually schedule a short [...] "safety stop" [...] at , , or , depending on the <b>training</b> <b>agency.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 Skin Diver magazine, {{the leading}} {{recreational}} diving publication at the time, published a three-part series arguing that nitrox was unsafe for sport divers.

2500|$|Diving {{with and}} {{handling}} nitrox raise {{a number of}} potentially fatal dangers due to the high partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2). Nitrox is not a deep-diving gas mixture owing to the increased proportion of oxygen, which becomes toxic when breathed at high pressure. For example, the maximum operating depth of nitrox with 36% oxygen, a popular recreational diving mix, is [...] to ensure a maximum ppO2 {{of no more than}} [...] The exact value of the maximum allowed ppO2 and maximum operating depth varies depending on factors such as the <b>training</b> <b>agency,</b> the type of dive, the breathing equipment and the level of surface support, with professional divers sometimes being allowed to breathe higher ppO2 than those recommended to recreational divers.|$|E
2500|$|Solo diving, once {{considered}} technical diving and discouraged by most recreational diver certification agencies as {{more dangerous than}} buddy diving, is now considered by many experienced divers and some certification agencies to be an acceptable practice for suitably trained, equipped, and competent recreational divers, and by some other agencies to be occasionally inevitable. Rather than relying on the traditional buddy diving safety system, solo divers are self-sufficient and willing {{to take responsibility for}} their own safety while diving. The first <b>training</b> <b>agency</b> to offer a Solo Diving certification was Scuba Diving International (SDI) in 1999. In 2011, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) started offering a solo specialty called [...] "Self-Reliant Diver", which in many respects (entry requirements, for example) is very similar to the course offered by SDI.|$|E
