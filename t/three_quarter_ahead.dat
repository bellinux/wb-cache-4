40|$|We {{evaluate}} the out-of-sample forecasting performance of six competing models at horizons {{of up to}} <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> in a pseudo-real time setup. All the models use information in monthly indicators released ahead of quarterly GDP. We estimate two models – averaged vector autoregressions and bridge equations – relying on just a few monthly indicators. The remaining four models condition the forecast on a large set of monthly series. These models comprise two standard principal components models, a dynamic factor model based on the Kalman smoother and a generalized dynamic factor model. We benchmark our results {{to the performance of}} a naÃ¯ve model and the historical near-term forecasts of the Czech National Bank’s staff. The findings are also compared with a related study conducted by ECB staff (Barhoumi et al., 2008). In the Czech case, standard principal components is the most precise model overall up to <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead.</b> However, the CNB staff’s historical forecasts were the most accurate one <b>quarter</b> <b>ahead.</b> Bridge models, dynamic factor models, GDP forecasting, principal components, real-time evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|Even at the {{beginning}} of 2008, the economic recession of 2008 / 09 was not being predicted. The failure to predict recessions is a persistent theme in economic forecasting. The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides data on predictions made for the growth of total output, GDP, in the United States for one, two, <b>three</b> and four <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> {{since the end of the}} 1960 s. Over a <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> horizon, the mean prediction made for GDP growth has never been negative over this period. The correlation between the mean SPF <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> forecast and the data is very low, and over the most recent 25 years is not significantly different from zero. Here, we show that the machine learning technique of random forests has the potential to give early warning of recessions. We use a small set of explanatory variables from financial markets which would have been available to a forecaster at the time of making the forecast. We train the algorithm over the 1970 Q 2 - 1990 Q 1 period, and make predictions one, <b>three</b> and six <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead.</b> We then re-train over 1970 Q 2 - 1990 Q 2 and make a further set of predictions, and so on. We did not attempt any optimisation of predictions, using only the default input parameters to the algorithm we downloaded in the package R. We compare the predictions made from 1990 to the present with the actual data. One <b>quarter</b> <b>ahead,</b> the algorithm is not able to improve on the SPF predictions. <b>Three</b> and six <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead,</b> the correlations between actual and predicted are low, but they are very significantly different from zero. Although the timing is slightly wrong, a serious downturn in the first half of 2009 could have been predicted six <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> in late 2007. The algorithm never predicts a recession when one did not occur. We obtain even stronger results with random forest machine learning techniques in the case of the United Kingdom...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of point and density forecasts of four dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models for output growth, inflation and the interest rate. The model parameters are estimated and forecasts are derived successively from historical U. S. data vintages synchronized with the Fed 2 ̆ 019 s Greenbook projections. In addition, I compute weighted forecasts using simple combination schemes as well as likelihood based methods. While forecasts from structuralmodels fail to forecast large recessions and booms, they are quite accurate during normal times. Model forecasts compare particularly well to nonstructural forecasts and to Greenbook projections for horizons of <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> and higher. Weighted forecasts are more precise than forecasts from single models. A simple average of forecasts yields an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with {{state of the art}} time series methods that can incorporate large datasets. Comparing density forecasts of DSGE models with the actual distribution of observations shows that the models overestimate uncertainty around point forecasts...|$|R

Depending on the set-up at each organisation there may not in fact be much continuity in the forecasting methodology over the sample period.

Executive Summary In this paper we examine the Reserve Bank’s forecasting performance relative to that of 8 external forecasting agencies. Our forecasts of annual target CPI inflation and annual average growth in production-based GDP are examined. Inflation forecast errors In terms of bias, we find that: • We have consistently and significantly under-estimated annual CPI target inflation 3 to 10 <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead.</b> • The NZIER’s forecasts of inflation 4 to 9 <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead</b> are unbiased and hav...|$|R

In a pseudo out-of-sample forecasting context, we select optimal models in the time dimension and the optimal size of the ordered data set in the cross-sectional dimension. The main empirical ?ndings of this paper are that the cross-sectional opti- mization substantially improves the forecasting performance of the factor models. However, only the dynamic factor model systematically outper- forms and encompasses the autoregressive benchmark model with an op- timal subset of the data of around 110 series. The forecasting gains in terms of mean squared errors range from 10 % to 30 % for forecast horizons up to 6 <b>quarters</b> <b>ahead.</b> Factor models; Forecasting; Leading Indicators. ...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty {{associated}} with an optimal number of macroeconomic variables {{to be used in}} factor model is challenging since there is no criteria which states what kind of data should be used, how many variables to employ and does disaggregated data improve factor model’s forecasts. The paper studies an impact of nested macroeconomic data on Latvian GDP forecasting accuracy within factor modelling framework. Nested data means disaggregated data or sub-components of aggregated variables. We employ Stock-Watson factor model in order to estimate factors and to make GDP projections two periods ahead. Root mean square error is employed as the standard tool to measure forecasting accuracy. According to this empirical study we conclude that additional information that contained in disaggregated components of macroeconomic variables could be used to enhance Latvian GDP forecasting accuracy. The efficiency gain improving forecasts is about 0. 15 - 0. 20 percentage points of year on year quarterly growth for the forecasting period 1 <b>quarter</b> <b>ahead,</b> but for 2 <b>quarter</b> <b>ahead</b> it’s about half percentage point. ...|$|R
