5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had with the game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts. Reviewers highly praised its narrative, and some reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> work better as a short film, or an audio drama, {{rather than as a}} game.|$|E
5|$|The game {{originally}} did {{not have}} a cooperative multiplayer mode, as the development team <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> distract from the tonally darker levels of the single-player campaign, not matching the game's narrative. However, a cooperative mode was still added to the game in August 2012 as free downloadable content; it does not follow the storyline of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> negatively {{impact on the}} conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
50|$|Production was in {{stellite}}, arsenic, {{silver and}} cobalt until 1956 when the stellite division moved to Belleville. Only silver ore {{continued to be}} treated there until the plant closed in March 1961. 'Cleanup' and demolition of the mine site followed with tons of arsenite refuse being buried, with the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> eliminate the health hazard.|$|R

60|$|Philip had <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> cost {{at least}} five-and-twenty pounds. It was a large sum to him. He was willing to spend his last penny on her.|$|R
5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} more {{profitable}} {{to have a new}} album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio {{just a couple of months}} before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|Groening <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be funny}} {{to have a}} baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The second draft was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as {{the children of the}} Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film was a step back in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E

5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally {{thought that it}} could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E
25|$|By mid August {{wet weather}} had impeded {{operations}} further {{but for the}} besieging force it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> impede any army of relief.|$|E
25|$|Vishwanath Nayak, one of {{the eight}} producers, a {{chartered}} accountant for Arun Nalawade, a Marathi stage actor, suggested him to make a film. Later, Arun came across a story by writer Madhavi Gharpure, published in the Diwali edition of a magazine and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make a wonderful film storyline.|$|E
6000|$|Ludlow was daunted in his turn; {{he had not}} <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be {{a little}} embarrassing, certainly, {{but he could not}} quite own this. He laughed and said, [...] "I have a notion she will propose it herself, if you give her a chance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "that Junius is away, for he would be very glad to see you, and it never came into my mind to mention to you that he was obliged to be in Washington at this time. And, as for the party, I <b>thought</b> {{afterwards}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be a great deal}} cosier just to have a few persons here." ...|$|R
25|$|While {{working in}} his {{recording}} studio, Cuccurullo heard the voice of Neil Carlill, lead singer of the group Delicatessen on one of that band's music videos, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> fit the project. Cuccurullo found Carlill through the group’s record label, and invited him to record some music at the studio.|$|E
25|$|Some state {{officials}} and Arkansas residents {{objected to the}} creation of the theme park because they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> encourage negative hillbilly stereotypes. Lou Oberste of the Publicity and Parks Commission expressed reservations, and Commission Director Bob Evans agreed that Arkansas had difficulty shedding a similar image created by comedic actor Bob Burns.|$|E
25|$|But, in 1710, Quli Khan {{was brought}} {{back as the}} diwan (revenue officer) of the {{province}} {{on the advice of}} us-Shan. According to Sarkar, he did so to form an allegiance with him, as he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be impossible to occupy the Delhi throne without the support of local nobility. Though he was brought back, his relationship with the Mughal prince remained stained.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had <b>thought,</b> Sire, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{unnecessary}} {{to advance}} proofs of his innocence until there were proofs of his guilt to be refuted. It is unusual, Your Majesty, to apprehend a gentleman {{so that he}} may show cause why he did not deserve such apprehension. The more usual course is to arrest him because there are proofs of his guilt to be preferred against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Askerton <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{perhaps he}} had better come. I told him of all that which we said to each other the other day. He <b>thought</b> at first <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better <b>that</b> I should not see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "I never <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be worth doing. Hulloa, it is twenty minutes past seven, and we dine at half past. I shall catch it from Ida. Come on, Colonel Quaritch; you don't {{know what it}} is to have a {{daughter}}--a daughter when one is late for dinner is a serious thing for any man," [...] and he started off down the hill in a hurry.|$|R
25|$|In 1919 Goddard <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{premature}} {{to disclose the}} results of his experiments, because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report he had submitted in late 1916.|$|E
25|$|This was {{significantly}} different from all other romanization schemes in that, from the very outset, it was intended that the Latinxua Sinwenz system, once established, would supersede the Chinese characters. They {{decided to use the}} Latin alphabet because they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> serve their purpose better than Cyrillic. Unlike Gwoyeu Romatzyh, with its complex method of indicating tones, Latinxua Sinwenz system does not indicate tones at all, and it is not Mandarin-specific and so could be used for other Chinese varieties.|$|E
25|$|Kvachkov {{was adamant}} to entreats of his {{supporters}} {{to run for the}} Duma mandate, which would set him free (elected representatives receive immunity from legal prosecution of any kind, whether it's criminal or civil). Kvachkov <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make him look guilty. He continuously insisted that there was no wrongdoing in his actions, even if it was he who stood behind the assassination masterplan, so he shouldn't look for a way to avoid jail time. However, a group of major nationalist groups nominated Kvachkov for the race without even asking his permission.|$|E
6000|$|Hearing {{this the}} thief <b>thought</b> to himself <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be useless now to destroy her jewels, {{when she had}} promised to give them to him {{presently}} of her own good will. He therefore let her go, and sat down and thus soliloquized: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be so, Knapp. You {{have made}} it fast now, I suppose? That is right. Now lie down and get {{an hour or two}} of sleep; it is scarce likely that he will be back until late.|$|R

25|$|During the {{serialization}} of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakenly {{titled the}} Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and {{was unable to}} correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, because she <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes. She wrote in her final afterword that Setsuna and Sara have reached emotional maturity after their adventures and will live happily together.|$|E
25|$|In 1711, Blackmore {{produced}} The Nature of Man, a physiological/theological poem {{on climate}} and character (with the English climate being the best). This was a tune up for Creation: A Philosophical Poem in 1712, which was praised by John Dennis, Joseph Addison, and, later, Samuel Johnson, for its Miltonic tone. It ran to 16 editions, {{and of all}} his epics it was best received. Its design was to refute the atheism of Vanini, Hobbes and (supposedly) Spinoza, and to unfold the intellectual philosophy of Locke. Johnson <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be the sole memory of Blackmore, and Dennis {{said that it was}} the English De Rerum Natura, but with infinitely better reasoning.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care. Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} modern period to the late eighteenth century, the {{etiquette}} - and medical textbooks - advised to just wash {{the parts of the}} body that were visible to the public. Meaning the face, ears, neck, hands and feet. This is because <b>it</b> was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> bathing <b>would</b> remove the natural protective layer of the skin. Bathing was during the Renaissance mainly reserved for the sick - and then usually dressed in a shirt, and also further preferably in spring water.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, {{they went}} into the forest a little way, where they found that they were {{protected}} from the rain by the trees. This proved, as Forester said, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had not been raining very long; and he <b>thought,</b> from appearances, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> soon clear up.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{too good}} sailors, mother dear, to take many chances, {{and we had}} fair warning of this storm. If we hadn't been in such sore straits, there's no {{question}} but {{that we would have}} been prepared for it. I noticed the clouds gathering, but at the time <b>thought</b> only <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be our misfortune, since we could not keep watch of the Indians. Close-reefed, and with plenty of sea-room, the Future Hopes will ride out this gale without doing more harm to herself than the straining of a seam, perhaps." ...|$|R
