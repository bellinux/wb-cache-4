25|$|The {{eruption}} of the Thera volcano provides a possible <b>time</b> <b>marker</b> for the region. A large eruption, {{it would have}} sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade.

Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627BCE and 1600BCE with a 95% degree of probability. Archaeologist Kevin Walsh, accepting the radiocarbon dating, suggests a possible date of 1628 and believes this to be the most debated event in Mediterranean archaeology.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message of}} CDMA signals is {{transmitted}} as {{a sequence of}} text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains ephemerides for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) {{and part of the}} almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites. The message can also contain Earth rotation parameters, ionosphere models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system <b>time</b> <b>marker</b> is transmitted with each string; UTC leap second correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver. The strings have a version tag to facilitate forward compatibility: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment {{will be able to use}} additional information from newer satellites.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase. It can be inferred from the results that the increase in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized that the increase in copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein. In addition, it was speculated that the increase in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a <b>time</b> <b>marker</b> as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E

40|$|Capillary zone electrophoresis, {{with its}} high {{resolution}} capability in {{the separation of}} different compounds, is well suited for the investigation of metal containing proteins, especially when elemental detection is conducted using hyphenated inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

The migration time of proteins varies significantly, depending {{on the nature of the}} matrix. Electropherograms are consequently difficult to compare and the peak identification is uncertain. Pre analytical steps for the reduction of matrix compounds enhance the quality of the data, but the results are still unsatisfactory.

5000|$|When {{shifting}} {{focus from}} one object {{to a second}} object, the saccadic movement of one’s eyes is also accompanied by a conscious shift of attention. In {{the context of the}} stopped clock illusion, not only do your eyes move, but you also shift your attention to the clock. This led researchers to question whether the movement of the eyes or simply the shift of the observer’s attention towards the second stimulus initiated saccadic masking. Experiments in which subjects diverted only their attention without moving their eyes revealed that the redirection of attention alone was not enough to initiate chronostasis. [...] This suggests that attention is not the <b>time</b> <b>marker</b> used when perception is filled back in. Rather, the physical movement of the eyes themselves serves as this critical marker. However, this relationship between attention and perception in the context of chronostasis is often difficult to measure and may be biased in a laboratory setting. Because subjects may be biased as they are instructed to perform actions or to redirect their attention, the concept of attention serving as a critical <b>time</b> <b>marker</b> for chronostasis may not be entirely dismissed.|$|E
