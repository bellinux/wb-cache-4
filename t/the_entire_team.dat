5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> surviving to <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E

5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. Redemptions story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, {{a writer for the}} source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E

Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production. On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes {{in just a few hours}} before its air time of 10 PM Eastern Time.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} Super Bowl to have {{individual}} player introductions for both teams (both the Ravens' and Giants' defenses were announced).

5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team.</b> Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be tabled until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes.|$|R
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team,</b> and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league {{contract}} {{to return to the}} Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team,</b> and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5000|$|In {{baseball}} statistics, NERD (a wink {{towards the}} mnemonic [...] "Narration, Exposition, Reflection, Description") is a quantitative measure of expected aesthetic value.

5|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, {{one-third of the}} reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title. This year, CMLL resolved the situation differently, but still managed to organize in a tournament. The champions, Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr., and Metro, successfully defended their championship on November 15, 2010, in Arena Puebla. Dorada suffered an ankle injury {{during the course of}} the match. Citing both the injury (which would keep him out a month) and, more so, the demands of his other three championships, Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later. CMLL broke with the precedent of forcing <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada. Voting was held for over two weeks on CMLL.com.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team.</b> In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the 2015 season {{marked the first time}} that the Sounds played at the new {{downtown}} First Tennessee Park, which is located at the former site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark. The Sounds defeated the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, in the inaugural home opener in front of an announced paid attendance of 10,459. First baseman Max Muncy secured the win with a walk-off RBI double, scoring Billy Burns from first base, before being mobbed by his Sounds teammates on the field. Under manager Steve Scarsone, Nashville finished their first season as an A's affiliate in third place with a 66–78 record. Barry Zito, who won the American League Cy Young Award in 2002, made his return to professional baseball with the Sounds in 2015 after sitting out the 2014 season. Zito was lauded by his Nashville teammates for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> on his birthday.|$|E

5|$|Using {{the device}} he created earlier, Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound, killing {{most of the}} Army {{personnel}} there. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is severely wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> in order to battle the now cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor. However, Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains control of his board, restoring his power. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board.|$|E
5|$|While riding for Astana in the 2007 Tour de France, Alexander Vinokourov tested {{positive}} for blood doping, causing <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> {{to be removed from}} the race and Vinokourov to retire after being banned from the sport by his national federation and the UCI. After confirming in October 2008 his intention to return to competitive cycling, Vinokourov stated {{on the eve of the}} 2009 Tour de France that he would rejoin Astana, the team he believes was created expressly for him, at the expiration of his two-year ban on July 24. He indicated that Astana manager Johan Bruyneel will be bound by the team's sponsors to accept him, or else Bruyneel would be forced from the team. Bruyneel publicly stated in April 2008 that he did not want Vinokourov on a team he ran.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{traveling}} without {{key players}} Marion Motley and Bill Willis because of Florida's segregation laws, Cleveland beat Miami in a shutout {{for the second}} time in the season, winning 34–0. Fueled by the ire <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> felt because of leaving friends behind, Otto Graham opened the scoring with a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Browns never looked back. Three other Browns players – Edgar Jones, Gaylon Smith and Gene Fekete – ran for touchdowns. Fekete's touchdown was the only one of his short professional career. Groza kicked two field goals, giving him 12 on the season and tying the all-time professional record set in 1926 by Paddy Driscoll. Cleveland led Miami in all phases of the game, amassing 159 yards rushing to Miami's eight and 233 yards of total offense. Miami gained a total of 46 yards rushing and passing. As the Browns prepared to face the Dodgers in the last game of the regular season, they looked ahead to a matchup in the AAFC championship in Cleveland on December 22 with the New York Yankees, the winners the eastern division.|$|E
