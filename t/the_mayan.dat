5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayan</b> Civilization {{was located}} on the Yucatán Peninsula and into the isthmian portion of North America, and Northern portion of Central America (Guatemala and Honduras) was formed {{of a number of}} ajawil, ajawlel, or ajawlil– {{hierarchical}} polities headed by an hereditary ruler known as a kuhul ajaw (<b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> term indicating a sovereign leader). Despite constant warfare and shifts in regional power, most Maya kingdoms remained a part of the region's landscape, even following subordination to hegemonic rulers through conquest or dynastic union. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> civilization began its decline in the 8th and 9th centuries, and {{by the time of the}} arrival of the Spanish, only a few kingdoms remained, such as Tayasal, Mam, Kaqchikel, and the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj. On 13 March 1697, the last Itza Mayan king was defeated at Tayasal by the forces of King Philip IV of Spain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayan</b> {{language}} {{family is}} extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established, {{except for some}} minor unresolved differences.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}} {{were popular}} figures in <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> codices {{as well as}} in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as least concern by the IUCN, they are decreasing in number, due primarily to habitat loss.|$|E
40|$|Since the 16 th century <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> {{have had}} contact with Christianity, which has been mostly through the Roman Catholic Church. The contact has {{resulted}} in a range of Christianization, consisting of methods such as teaching and evangelism to forced conversion and brutality. No matter the form of proselytization, the impact on <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> has been quite considerable. These outside influences have led <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> to syncretize their beliefs with first the Roman Catholics and in more current history, the Protestants. Although both have tried to move <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> away from their polytheistic religion in order to more fully embrace Orthodox Christianity, <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> have fought to keep their identity. This fight has occurred by means of direct defiance to Christianity through rebellion and violence, but has also been fought more subtly through syncretism. Though defiance through physical confrontation has led to Mayans being pacified by the Spaniards, syncretism has allowed the identity of <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> to be concealed and preserved through Roman Catholicism. Drawing from indigenous testimonials, <b>the</b> history of <b>Mayan</b> interaction with Protestants and Roman Catholics, and anti-syncretic Mayans I will demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> have preserved their identity through syncretism...|$|R
50|$|The Ch'orti' {{belong to}} <b>the</b> Meridional <b>Mayans,</b> and {{are closely related}} to <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> in Yucatán, Belize and Northern Guatemala. They are also {{somewhat}} related to <b>the</b> Choles, <b>Mayans</b> that currently live in Chiapas.|$|R

5|$|The codex {{has played}} a key role in the {{deciphering}} of Mayan hieroglyphs. Dresden librarian Ernst Wilhelm Förstemann published the first complete facsimile in 1880. He deciphered the calendar section of the codex, including the Maya numerals used therein. Förstemann determined that these numbers, along with deities and day names, related to <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> calendar and <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> Long Count calendar. In the 1950s Yuri Knorozov used a phonetic approach based on the De Landa alphabet for decoding the codex, which was followed up in the 1980s by other scholars that did additional deciphering based on this concept.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala, {{matters such}} as {{developing}} standardized orthographies for <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> languages are governed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 peace accords, it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.|$|E
5|$|In {{colonial times}} Mayan {{languages}} {{came to be}} written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).|$|E
50|$|In 1517 Francisco Hernández de Córdoba saled to Isla Mujeres {{where he}} found {{the ruins of a}} Maya village and an observatory. They {{continued}} inland and made contact with <b>the</b> <b>Mayans.</b> They attacked <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> but were defeated, but managed to take two prisoners as translators.|$|R
50|$|There are vines which reach {{from the}} opening {{all the way down}} to the water along with small waterfalls. There are black catfish which swim in the cenote. Cenote Ik Kil is sacred to <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> used this cenote for both {{relaxation}} and ritual services.|$|R
50|$|Season One {{began with}} the Sons of Anarchy finding their weapon storage {{warehouse}} being burned down by <b>the</b> <b>Mayans,</b> a rival motorcycle gang. Juice found out that <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> own two heroin factories near Oakland and an industrial storage warehouse in San Leandro. He also found out that Marcus Álvarez is the President of the Mayans' Oakland chapter and is most likely leading all of their Northern Californian charters. This information allowed Clay, Jax Teller, Tig Trager and Chibs Telford to locate where <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> were storing their weapons and steal them back.|$|R
5|$|Studies {{estimate}} that Mayan languages are spoken {{by more than}} 6 million people. Most of them live in Guatemala where depending on estimates 40%-60% of the population speaks a Mayan language. In Mexico <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> speaking population was estimated at 2,5 million people in 2010, whereas the Belizean speaker population figures around 30,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayan</b> {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are {{understood to be}} due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayan</b> {{language}} {{family is}} one of the best-documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from the Proto-Mayan language, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Ch'olan-Tzeltalan branches.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mayan</b> {{languages}} form {{a language}} family spoken in Mesoamerica and northern Central America. Mayan languages are spoken {{by at least}} 6 million Maya peoples, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognizes eight more within their territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} and glyphs were painted by skilled craftsmen using thin brushes and vegetable dyes. Black and red {{were the main}} colors used {{for many of the}} pages. Some pages have detailed backgrounds in shades of yellow, green, and <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> blue. The codex was written by eight different scribes, who all had their own writing style, glyph designs, and subject matter.|$|E
5|$|Tongue {{piercing}} was {{practiced by}} the Aztec, Olmec and Mayan cultures as a ritual symbol. Wall paintings highlight a ritual of the Mayans during which nobility would pierce their tongues with thorns. The blood would be collected on bark, which would be burned in honor of <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> gods. It was also {{practiced by the}} Haida, Kwakiutl and Tlingit, {{as well as the}} Fakirs and Sufis of the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E
5|$|Belize was, {{until the}} 15th century, {{a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> Empire, {{containing}} smaller states headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ajaw (later k’uhul ajaw). The present monarchy of Belize {{has its roots in}} the Spanish monarchy, under the authority of which the area was first colonised in the 16th century, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 21 September 1981, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Belize. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Belize, Sir Colville Young.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{unaware of}} the {{presence}} of Morbus, a war is raging between three races who have recently come into contact with one another; the Romans, the Vikings and <b>the</b> <b>Mayans.</b> <b>The</b> first to encounter the Dark Lands are the Romans, whose scouts return word of the effects of shadow-weed, which they initially believe to be a new Mayan weapon. As a result, the Romans attack and destroy a nearby Mayan colony, but quickly realise the Dark Lands are not the Mayans' doing. When <b>the</b> <b>Mayans,</b> who have also encountered the Dark Lands, suggest a temporary alliance, the Romans reluctantly agree. However, as they begin to investigate the Dark Lands further, <b>the</b> <b>Mayans</b> turn on them.|$|R

5|$|In ca. 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented {{distinctive}} {{letters for}} ejectives in <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> languages of Guatemala, the tresillo and cuatrillo (and derivatives). These {{were used in}} all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in Otomi (pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.|$|E
5|$|Though Lieder {{herself has}} not {{specified}} a new {{date for the}} object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, {{as it was the}} end of a cycle (baktun) in the long count in <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> calendar. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} records {{have been used}} to interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is <b>the</b> <b>Mayan</b> interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E
