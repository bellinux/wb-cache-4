25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose {{terminal}} section {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib. These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. <b>This</b> <b>whole</b> <b>process</b> takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all these}} ways – the {{organization}} of the new police, the new Poor Law, and in the new municipal councils – the pattern of government in England was changed fundamentally within a single decade. [...] In conjunction with the removal of religious disabilities, these reforms laid the structural foundation for a new kind of State in Britain: a State in which the electoral rights and civil rights of citizens were extended and given greater legal protection, but in which the ordinary citizen was subjected to a much greater degree of administrative interference, direction, and control from the centre. [...] The most spectacular element in <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>process</b> – the Reform Bill of 1832 – ensured that the state should also be partially democratized at the centre. [...] The full significance of 1832 {{in the history of the}} country is appreciated only if it is seen as the central change in this mini-sided transformation of an agricultural nation ruled by squires, parsons, and the wealthy landowners into an industrial nation dominated by the classes produced by industrial expansion and commercial enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced intracellularly {{by the action of}} carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to bicarbonate (...) and an [...] ion (a proton), as previously mentioned. The bicarbonate (...) exits at the basal portion of the cell via sodium (...) symport and chloride (...) antiport and re-enters circulation, where it may accept a proton if blood pH decreases, thus acting as a weak, basic buffer. The remaining [...] left over from the intracellular production of carbonic acid (H2CO3) exits the apical (urinary lumen) portion of the cell by [...] antiport, acidifying the urine. There, it may join with another bicarbonate (...) that dissociated from its [...] in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H2CO3) because bicarbonate (...) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H2CO3) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO2 and H2O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> <b>process,</b> there is a greater net balance of [...] in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate (...) , and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that any bicarbonate (...) that was left over in the lumen diffuses back into the cell as carbonic acid, , or H2O.|$|E
