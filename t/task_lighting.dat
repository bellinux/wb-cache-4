2500|$|Respondents to {{the survey}} said they mostly found the {{building}} pleasant. They gave its daylighting their highest marks. [...] "I prefer the natural light whenever it is available," [...] one said in comments, [...] "and {{have a tendency to}} turn off the lights in the office when the sun is shining in through the atrium glass wall," [...] although two-thirds said they still used <b>task</b> <b>lighting.</b> Three-quarters said they made use of the window blinds to regulate the daylight in their offices. Almost half said their access to it was excellent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Task</b> <b>lighting</b> {{can also}} be applied to home uses. Many people benefit from {{dedicated}} lighting for specific tasks such as cooking, sewing, reading, or paperwork. Home <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> {{can be found in}} fixed or adjustable forms.|$|E
50|$|Often <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> {{refers to}} {{increasing}} illuminance to better accomplish a specific activity. However, the illuminance level {{is not the}} only factor governing visibility. Contrast is also important, and a poorly positioned light source may cause contrast reduction, resulting in loss of visibility. The most important purpose of <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> in the office is not increasing illuminance, but improving contrast. General lighting can be reduced because <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> provides focused light where needed.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>task</b> <b>lights</b> {{also come}} with built in {{magnifying}} glasses for detailed tasks. It {{is hard to}} overstate the benefits of having focused light alongside magnification for small, precise operations such as model building, sewing, or other high-detail activities.

50|$|The {{portable}} {{or table}} lamp {{is probably the}} most common fixture, found in many homes and offices.

5000|$|<b>Task</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is mainly}} {{functional}} {{and is usually}} the most concentrated, for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials.

Special {{instances of}} <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> are examination and operation lights for medicine and surgery, {{as well as}} the dentist's lamp. Task lamps are also used for many home tasks such as sewing, reading, small repairs, model construction, crafts, writing, and many other activities.

The DC power allocation is controlled by sharing the number of LED chips between the terminals and the AC power allocation decides the fraction of the information signal energy to be consumed at the terminals.

We investigate the bit error rate (BER) performance of the relay-assisted VLC system and optimize the performance through optimal ac/dc power allocation under illumination constraints. The dc power allocation is determined by sharing the number of LED chips between the terminals to satisfy a desired luminance ratio. The ac power allocation decides the fraction of the information signal power to be consumed at the terminals in order to minimize the BER. Numerical results reveal that cooperation brings significant performance gains over direct transmission. We further provide comparisons of two relaying techniques under consideration and discuss the effect of clipping noise on the error rate performance. Qatar National Research Fun...|$|R

50|$|Smart {{lighting}} is a lighting technology designed for energy efficiency.

50|$|The {{asymmetric}} <b>task</b> <b>light</b> {{is intended}} to be placed {{at the side of the}} actual task. The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the lamp head. It mostly has an arm system that holds the lamp head horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a parallel arm. Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the fact}} that {{practical}} application of QDs composites is mainly related to the interaction with light, the investigation of irradiation influence on the optical properties of QDs in polymer matrix is an important <b>task.</b> <b>Light</b> interaction with QDs can affect the latter in different ways. Very often, high-energy photons launch photoreactions on the surface of such nanocrystals. Under ambient conditions, there are two possible ways of such influence: (i) modification of nanocrystal surface leading to the increase of luminescence intensity and (ii) photooxidation of nanocrystals resulting in degradation of the luminescence spectra. During prolonged irradiation, the combination of both effects is expected.|$|R
