40|$|The idea of deducing legal rulings in Islamic law, or ijtihād, {{as well as}} the <b>qualifications</b> <b>of</b> {{the person}} who {{practices}} ijtihād, known as the mujtahid, has been a complex issue among Muslim ʿulamāʾ for centuries. Many Muslim ʿulamāʾ and Western scholars have maintained that the gate of ijtihād was closed. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> mujtahid was therefore impossible to attain. The Moroccan intellectual al-Khamlīshī maintains that the strenuous conditions put forth by some of the Sunni jurists to qualify an individual to become a mujtahid actually contributed to the demise <b>of</b> ijtihād. These <b>qualifications,</b> according to al-Khamlīshī, were proven to be unachievable and stood as myriad obstacles in creating new generations to reform the old Islamic fiqh. This essay shows that, despite the extremely strenuous set <b>of</b> <b>qualifications,</b> through the writings of al-Khamlīshī, Moroccan women penetrated men’s domain in Islamic family law, breaking the long-standing monopoly men held therein...|$|R
