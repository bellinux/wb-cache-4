Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where it started. I went to the DC library and {{read some of the}} early stories. I tried {{to get a sense of}} what Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E

500|$|Piper's 2010 {{appearance}} in The End of Time, Tennant's final {{story as a}} series regular, was leaked by the press in May 2009 when Piper was seen photographed on location with Coduri and Tennant. Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part-human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about {{their lives in the}} parallel universe. Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose's story in the perfect way by choosing to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the beginning of her acquaintance with the Doctor. [...] Piper's return for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary episode was confirmed in March 2013. Moffat wished to include Piper in the episode because he felt that she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who. As he did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' story arc, he chose instead to re-introduce her Bad Wolf persona. During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor. Reviewers noted similarities between the characterisation of Bad Wolf Rose and that of a plot device used by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Ted B. Kissell, a journalist for The Atlantic likened the War Doctor to Ebenezer Scrooge and dubbed Rose the [...] "Ghost of Doctors Yet to Come".|$|E
