5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly.

5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> tropical climates and warm temperatures. They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|After these revelations, {{the people}} of Springfield begin to {{distrust}} Armin. Armin decides {{that there is no}} longer any place for him in Springfield. The real Skinner is then offered the chance to realize his dream and take over as school principal.

Armin, however, has already left Springfield and gone to Capital City to resume his old persona as a no-good street thug.|$|E
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants {{are sensitive to}} frost, and <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
50|$|Straight-tusked {{elephants}} probably {{lived in}} small herds {{of about five}} to 15 individuals. <b>They</b> <b>preferred</b> warm conditions and flourished in the interglacial periods during the current Ice Age, spreading from continental Europe to Great Britain during the warmer periods. It is assumed that <b>they</b> <b>preferred</b> wooded environments. During colder periods, the species may have migrated south. The straight-tusked elephant became extinct in Britain {{near the beginning of}} the Weichselian glaciation, about 115,000 years ago. Eventually, the ecological niche of the straight-tusked elephant would be taken by the mammoth.|$|R

5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In semi-arid climates, <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.|$|E
5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. <b>They</b> <b>prefer</b> tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fruit and insects, although small reptiles and frogs have been recorded. The fruits consumed are often from the plant families Lauraceae, Annonaceae, and Rubiaceae, although a few other plant families have also been reported in their diet. They are one of many species recorded following army ants. They occasionally will eat high protein fruits, but <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> to eat the other fruits on their menu.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter <b>they</b> <b>prefer</b> out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E
