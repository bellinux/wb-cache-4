5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Meg {{is given}} {{a job at a}} local {{convenience}} store. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help Chris get a job there, too. Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he {{is given a}} large promotion which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> this, she is fired. Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand up for her.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} sources of {{information}} by which we {{have access to the}} earliest segments of Paul's career are the Bible's Book of Acts and the autobiographical elements of Paul's letters to the early church communities.

The chemistry between Barbara and himself is also evident, although the nature of their relationship is never made explicit in the television series, and their eventual marriage is only revealed forty-five years later.|$|E
25|$|Although often grouped {{with the}} Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as {{a proponent of}} the ancient {{learning}} movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic {{was none other than}} Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's Gomō jigi published long before Jinsai was ready for it to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is clear that in Sorai's later writings, in the Bendō and Benmei (1728) in particular, Sorai <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> Jinsai on nearly every count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.|$|E

Hanson also maintains that [...] "it stretches credulity to believe that the only papists or foreigners being beaten to death or lynched were the ones rescued by the Duke of York", that official figures say very little about the fate of the undocumented poor, and that the heat at the heart of the firestorms was far greater than an ordinary house fire, and was enough to consume bodies fully or leave only a few skeletal fragments.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple {{advances}} {{that the kind}} of sentimentality that he wishes to draw attention to is [...] "an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason" [...] and which is performed [...] "in full public view". Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into how we should react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
500|$|Among {{conservative}} Christians, {{there are}} cultural, political, and moral objections. [...] Attorney Constance Cumbey {{warns that the}} book can be [...] "seductive" [...] to those who lack an adequate Biblical education. [...] Theologians Tim LaHaye and Ron Rhodes are convinced Satin wants a centralized and coercive world government. [...] Moral philosopher Douglas Groothuis says Satin's vision is unsound because it lacks an absolute standard of good and evil. [...] Among left-leaning academics, criticism focuses on Satin's theoretical underpinnings. [...] Political scientist Michael Cummings <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the idea that consciousness is ultimately determining. [...] Science-and-society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to psychocultural class analysis. [...] A lengthy, systemic critique of New Age Politics, by communication studies professor Dana L. Cloud, accuses it of employing a [...] "therapeutic rhetoric generated to console activists after the failure of post-1968 revolutionary movements and to legitimate participation in liberal politics".|$|E
500|$|Wagman <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the way Davis {{moves from}} topic to topic and time period to time period. [...] Davis gives long {{personal}} {{histories of the}} principal players in his history, but fails to explain the reason they are important, and is compelled to repeat every positive claim made about Sesame Street. [...] In spite of this, Wagman states, Davis demonstrates the love and respect Cooney and the show's cast and crew had for each another. [...] For example, when Calloway {{was diagnosed with a}} mental illness, the show never fired him, and Wagman calls Henson's funeral [...] "heartbreaking". [...] Gillespie finds the [...] "nasty backstage wrangling" [...] and behind-the-scenes stories compelling. [...] Alex Altman of Time Magazine agrees, and calls Davis [...] "an unabashed fan of the show's charms rather than a dispassionate historian". [...] He also considers Davis' use of language breathless and his portrayals of the show's creators overly flattering.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple {{begins the}} chapter by citing several {{examples}} {{to illustrate how}} sentimentality is increasing as a cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. He then analyses falling education standards in the country, and links these trends to [...] "powerful intellectual currents" [...] that [...] "feed into the great Sargasso Sea of modern sentimentality about children", and asserts that in this regard {{the ideas of the}} philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau and the psychologist Steven Pinker have been particularly influential. He then examines a newspaper article which advocates reform of the British prison system. Dalrymple states that the article aroused an emotion [...] "whose effect, if not its intention, was to convince the person experiencing it that he was a person of superior sensibility and compassion", and that such emotionality [...] "often attaches to the question of crime and punishment in contemporary Britain". Dalrymple also cites a modern tendency for criminals under the influence of drugs or alcohol not to be held morally responsible for their crimes. Dalrymple <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> this, and agrees with Aristotle that a man is doubly culpable: first for the offence committed, and second for having intoxicated himself. Dalrymple also maintains that it is [...] "the sheerest sentimentality to see drug addicts as the victims of an illness" [...] and that, [...] "sentimentality is now a mass phenomenon almost beyond criticism or even comment".|$|E
500|$|Busoni wrote {{a number}} of essays on music. The Entwurf einer neue Ästhetike der Tonkunst (Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music), first {{published}} in 1907, set out the principles underlying his performances and his mature compositions. A collection of reflections which are [...] "the outcome of convictions long held and slowly matured", the Sketch asserts that [...] "The spirit of an artwork... remains unchanged in value through changing years" [...] but its form, manner of expression, and the conventions of the era when it was created, [...] "are transient and age rapidly". The Sketch includes the maxim that [...] "Music was born free; and to win freedom is its destiny". It therefore <b>takes</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> conventional wisdom on music, caricatured by Busoni as the constricting rules of the [...] "lawgivers". It praises the music of Beethoven and JS Bach as {{the essence of the}} spirit of music ("Ur-Musik") and says that their art should [...] "be conceived as a beginning, and not as an unsurpassable finality." [...] Busoni asserts the right of the interpreter vis-à-vis the purism of the [...] "lawgivers". [...] "The performance of music, its emotional interpretation, derives from those free heights whence descended Art itself... What the composer's inspiration necessarily loses through notation, his interpreter should restore by his own." [...] He envisages a future music that will include the division of the octave into more than the traditional 12 semitones. However, he asserted the importance of musical form and structure: His idea of a 'Young Classicism' [...] "aimed to incorporate experimental features in [...] "firm, rounded forms"... motivated each time by musical necessity." [...] (Brendel).|$|E
