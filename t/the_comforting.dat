25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1918 strike, Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned and was replaced by a serving soldier, General Sir Nevil Macready. Macready immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had <b>the</b> <b>comforting</b> knowledge that, given the circumstances in which his appointment was made, he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance that was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with.|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic commented: [...] "'Umbrella' is [...] to date, {{delivering}} mammoth if spacious drums, {{a towering}} backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned – an ideal spot between {{trying too hard}} and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take." [...] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian, [...] "Umbrella" [...] is [...] "evidence" [...] that Rihanna's [...] "strict work ethic is paying off", adding that she [...] "delivers [...] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork, though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which [...] "takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill {{the space between the}} slow-tempo beats", adding that the song is [...] "uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and <b>the</b> <b>comforting</b> warmth of the lyrics".|$|E

[...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E

500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>comforting,</b> well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{pain and}} {{sedation}} assessments by nurses undertaken with the Objective Pain Scale (OPS) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) {{to the current}} reference scale for paediatric intensive care that is <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale. To compare <b>the</b> unmodified <b>COMFORT</b> scale to a COMFORT "behaviour" scale which does not include physiologic items. To evaluate the ease of use of these scales. METHODS: This prospective observational comparative study {{was carried out in}} children aged 1 year or older who were admitted in an intensive care unit. At 2 to 3 time points within 24 hours, a pain sedation assessment was carried out by the nurse in charge of <b>the</b> child with <b>COMFORT</b> scale, OPS and VAS. Correlation tests were used to compare the scores of each scale. RESULTS: Nurses recorded 55 assessments in 20 children. Correlation studies showed a poor correlation between OPS, VAS and <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale (Spearman's r= 0. 54 and 0. 53 respectively) and a strong correlation between <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale and <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> "behaviour" scale (Spearman's r= 0. 96). <b>The</b> <b>COMFORT</b> behaviour scale was the most frequently fully completed scale. CONCLUSION: Among the 3 scales compared to <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale in this study, <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> "behaviour" scale was the only one to show a strong correlation and it also seemed to be the easiest to use...|$|R

2500|$|In 1937, King visited Germany and {{met with}} Adolf Hitler. [...] Possessing a {{religious}} yearning for direct insight into the hidden mysteries {{of life and the}} universe, and strongly influenced by the operas of Richard Wagner (who was also Hitler's favourite composer), King decided Hitler was akin to mythical Wagnerian heroes within whom good and evil were struggling. He thought that good would eventually triumph and Hitler would redeem his people and lead them to a harmonious, uplifting future. These spiritual attitudes not only guided Canada's relations with Hitler but gave the prime minister <b>the</b> <b>comforting</b> sense of a higher mission, that of helping to lead Hitler to peace. King commented in his journal that [...] "he is really one who truly loves his fellow-men, and his country, and would make any sacrifice for their good". [...] He forecast that [...] "the world will yet come to see a very great man–mystic in Hitler... I cannot abide in Nazism– the regimentation– cruelty– oppression of Jews– attitude towards religion, etc., but Hitler... will rank some day with Joan of Arc among the deliverers of his people." ...|$|E

This scale excludes the physiologic items from <b>the</b> <b>COMFORT</b> scale and retains only the behavioural items. It showed very good correlation with the Nurse Interpretation Score of Sedation.

For negative disparity, we cannot directly follow <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone model [20] to design our <b>comfort</b> value. <b>The</b> {{reason for this is that}} there is a conflict between the pop-out effect and comfort zone. If we directly use <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone model [20] to measure saliency, in some cases, stereo contrast model and stereo focus model may give quite different results for an object with negative disparity, which will reduce the performance our proposed model. For example, if the pixel has a large negative disparity and is far from <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> value, its pop-out value becomes big, and its comfort value is small. After the fusion of two models, the results may be not reliable. To reduce the errors caused by such conflicts, we increase the importance of the negative disparity in <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone by using α to balance <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> value of <b>the</b> negative disparity. There are two benefits in this modification. Firstly, this modification increases the importance of the pop-out effect for the object with the negative disparity. Secondly, it still keeps a high importance for the object in <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone in stereoscopic saliency analysis. According to our experiments, our modification for <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> zone works in most cases and improves the performance of the proposed model.|$|R
