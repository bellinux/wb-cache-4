5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> old public houses, {{which have}} been {{continuously}} open, such as the Golden Cross in Princess Street, the Dun Cow in Abbey Foregate, and the King's Head in Mardol. The Golden Cross is reputed to be the oldest licensed public house in Shrewsbury and records show that it {{was used as an}} inn as far back as 1428. Its original name was the Sextry, because it was originally the sacristy of Old St Chad's Church.|$|E

25|$|A strong {{influence}} on the play is the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on The Catcher in The Rye to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.|$|E

There are also a handful of songs by European classical composers (Ignaz Pleyel, Thomas Arne, and Henry Rowley Bishop).The book even includes five hymns by Lowell Mason, long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that The Sacred Harp has preserved to this day.|$|E

25|$|In France this {{flat and}} simple {{treatment}} {{was to a}} certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.|$|E

[...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, [...] "Enchantment {{on the cutting}} edge, a dark yet heartfelt {{portrait of the artist}} as a young mannequin." [...] She too praised Depp's performance in stating, [...] "... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.|$|E

The ranghung [...] "self-created" [...] image of Avalokiteśvara enshrined in the utse of the dzong (brought by the Zhabdrung from Tibet) is displayed during the festival. During this five-day festival, also known as Punakha festival, held in February/March, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> impressive displays.

500|$|In 2014, to {{celebrate}} the show's 15th anniversary, IGN published {{a list of the}} 15 best Family Guy episodes, with [...] "Petarded" [...] ranked the best, saying: [...] "The show is at its comedic best with this episode, with musical numbers and family drama to back up the offensive humor." [...] In his review of Family Guy, volume 3, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] " [...] I will say <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good episodes in this set, starting with 'Petarded', which sees Peter declared mentally retarded. The ways he takes advantage of this status is classic Family Guy material, while the musical montage here, involving phone calls all over town, is actually quite funny. Plus, the appearance of the Naked, Greased-Up Deaf Guy gave hope that the creators still had that sense of the bizarre in them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The prison {{has come}} under far less scorn than {{comparable}} facilities at the state level, which tend to suffer heavily from overpopulation, low staff-to-inmate ratios and security issues inherent to attempting to enforce a supermax system in a non-purpose-built facility. Jamie Fellner of Human Rights Watch said after {{a tour of the}} facility, [...] "The Bureau of Prisons has taken a harsh punitive model and implemented it as well as anybody I know." [...] Notorious escape artist Richard Lee McNair wrote to a journalist from his cell in 2009 to say [...] "Thank God for prisons [...] <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> sick people in here...

2500|$|In a pure xenon lamp, the {{majority}} of the light is generated within a tiny, pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma situated where the electron stream leaves the face of the cathode. [...] The light generation volume is cone-shaped, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving from cathode to anode. [...] Electrons passing through the plasma cloud strike the anode, causing it to heat. As a result, the anode in a xenon short-arc lamp either has to be much larger than the cathode or be water-cooled, to dissipate the heat. The output of a pure xenon short-arc lamp offers fairly continuous spectral power distribution with a color temperature of about 6200K and color rendering index close to 100. However, even in a high pressure lamp <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> strong emission lines in the near infrared, roughly in the region from 850–900nm. This spectral region can contain about 10% of the total emitted light. Light intensity ranges from 20,000 to 500,000cd/cm2. An example is [...] "XBO lamp", which is an OSRAM trade name for pure xenon short-arc lamp.|$|E
