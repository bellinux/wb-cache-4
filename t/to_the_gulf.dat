As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E

In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
