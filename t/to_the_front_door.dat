5000|$|In Argentina and Chile the 4 van (Fourgonette) {{is known}} as [...] "Renoleta", {{following}} <b>the</b> nickname given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Citroën 2CV van, [...] "Citroneta". Due to heavy taxation on passenger vehicles in the late 1950s, the first 2CVs were imported unfinished, only up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> and completed with an Argentine-made pickup truck bed. The Spanish word for pickup truck is [...] "camioneta", hence [...] "Renoleta".|$|R

25|$|A couple {{stopped at}} Seascape and Bryant met them outside. When they {{asked if they}} could {{have a look at the}} accommodation, Bryant told them that they could not because his parents were away and his girlfriend was inside. His {{demeanor}} was described as quite rude and the couple felt uncomfortable. They left at about 12:35p.m. Bryant's car was seen reversed up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> It is assumed he unloaded ammunition.|$|E
25|$|A second {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} new era was that flat lead roofs now often replaced the former attics where the servants had slept. However, this lack of space was compensated in the new houses by the entire ground floor being given over to the servants. This floor, usually built of rusticated stone, was beneath the larger and grander piano nobile occupied by the employers. Ornate external staircases were built <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> which was now clearly on the first floor. The nobility now had very obvious minimal contact with those living downstairs.|$|E

He next saw Goldman's body a short {{distance}} away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle's name is German for chamber, berth, room, space, expanse, scope, area, or sphere and {{attempts}} <b>to</b> emphasize <b>the</b> {{vast amount of}} space it contains relative to its size. This is because <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> on both <b>the</b> driver and passenger sides open conventionally, but the rear doors slide open rearward and attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{top and bottom of}} the door openings and interlock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> Raum uses a similar door approach also used on the first-generation Mitsubishi RVR/Space Runner.|$|R

500|$|Allenville Mill Storehouse (also {{known as}} Company Storehouse or Allenville) is a {{historic}} mill storehouse at 5 Esmond Street in Esmond, Rhode Island within the town of Smithfield, Rhode Island. The exact date of construction is unknown, but it was built with rubble-construction as was typical of mill construction {{during and after the}} War of 1812. In 1813, Phillip Allen purchased 4.5 acres of land and constructed a mill on the site, but the first specific record to refer to the storehouse was an insurance policy from 1836. Allen sold the property in 1857 and it changed ownership several times before it became Esmond Mills in 1906. In 1937, the building was used as a post office and described erroneously as the [...] "Old Allenville Mill".

The Allenville Mill Storehouse was added to National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E
50|$|When firefighters {{were called}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire at around 03:30 {{they could see}} smoke seeping from the {{shuttered}} windows. When {{an attempt was made}} <b>to</b> force <b>the</b> locked <b>front</b> <b>door</b> open they were showered with sparks and embers and were forced to retreat. Once firefighters were able <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> it took four minutes to break it down - behind it they found that the staircase was completely on fire.|$|R
50|$|Externally {{the block}} is a {{seamless}} whole, but it’s {{made up of}} seven individual buildings (including the one in Cessnock Street).

Round the basement areas there are cast iron railings with arcaded detailing.|$|R
2500|$|GSA's design {{specifications}} required that extensive underground parking {{be incorporated into}} the building. Breuer designed a lightweight, six-acre (2.4 hectares) plaza to fit as a sort of roof over the underground parking garage. The plaza surface would be covered in masonry [...] "stones", with a curving driveway (mimicking <b>the</b> building facade) <b>to</b> lead vehicular traffic into the garage entrance and exit (which were situated {{in the center of the}} plaza). An offshoot of the driveway (set off by bollards) came up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> limousines of high-ranking visitors to pull up directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> Because <b>the</b> weight of <b>the</b> plaza/roof had <b>to</b> be kept light, no plantings (lawns, trees, shrubs, etc.) were envisioned for the plaza. Although the plaza was devoid of plants, its shape and vast expanse were designed to relate aesthetically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby National Mall.|$|R
500|$|Phoebe and Ross {{arrive at}} the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable {{to deal with his}} {{confession}} and gets on the plane anyway. Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is where they want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?". The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
500|$|Black {{determines that}} {{another set of}} numbers visible on the feed are {{latitude}} and longitude co-ordinates for San Francisco. The San Francisco Police Department are uncooperative, however. [...] After Black, Roedecker and Watts attempt to keep the feed counter from rising by recreating the live feed and substituting it, the second girl is murdered before the feed's counter reaches the allotted number. Avatar leaves another clue after the killing, which leads to two further video feeds—one shows a third set like the others, again with an empty chair, while the other shows the exterior of a mobile home. Police are able to locate the mobile home, but an officer is killed by a shotgun rigged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> before the trailer is obliterated {{by a series of}} explosions. Black travels to San Francisco, finding an abandoned theater whose marquee is displaying The Mikado. He is shot at by a masked gunman and give chase; however, he soon sees that the attacker is another kidnap victim, a gun tied to her arm in an attempt to trick Black into shooting her. [...] Watts tells Black that they found a charred body in the remains of the trailer, but Black tells him it is just another victim, and Avatar will most likely fall silent again - for a while.|$|E
