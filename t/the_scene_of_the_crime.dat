5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal {{only a handful of}} items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|Many {{accounts}} {{claim that}} Cascioferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend {{has it that}} Cascioferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society {{at the home of}} his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascioferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again. Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascioferro at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

Macbeth kills the sleeping king while Lady Macbeth waits nearby. When he brings the daggers from the king's room, Lady Macbeth orders him to return them to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> He refuses.

(In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a {{handkerchief}} found at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals {{that he is a}} big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels held an {{exhibition}} marking {{fifty years of}} The Adventures of Tintin. As part of this, they included artefacts that featured in the series, with the broken-eared Peruvian statue that inspired Hergé's Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show; however, they feared {{that it might be}} stolen, so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article. Imitating the events of The Broken Ear, a thief broke in and stole the statue. A letter was then sent to Le Soir in which an individual alleging to be the thief stated that the item would be returned if Hergé returned to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm. Hergé did so, but carried the book under his left arm; the thief never appeared, and the replica fetish was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching {{in the corner of the}} room, and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

5|$|Taking {{place in}} 1997, {{the story begins}} when Laura Harris is {{contacted}} by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, has gone on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> desperate to find {{an explanation for the}} well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so horrified at the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers her eyes. When she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father.|$|E
5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who has settled in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E
