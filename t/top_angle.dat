60|$|The {{outbreak}} of war was upon October 11th. On the 12th the Boer forces crossed the frontier {{both on the}} north and on the west. On the 13th they occupied Charlestown at the <b>top</b> <b>angle</b> of Natal. On the 15th they had reached Newcastle, a larger town some fifteen miles inside the border. Watchers from the houses saw six miles of canvas-tilted bullock wagons winding down the passes, and learned {{that this was not}} a raid but an invasion. At the same date news reached the British headquarters of an advance from the western passes, and of a movement from the Buffalo River on the east. On the 13th Sir George White had made a reconnaissance in force, but had not come in touch with the enemy. On the 15th six of the Natal Police were surrounded and captured at one of the drifts of the Buffalo River. On the 18th our cavalry patrols came into touch with the Boer scouts at Acton Homes and Besters Station, these being the voortrekkers of the Orange Free State force. On the 18th also a detachment was reported from Hadders Spruit, seven miles north of Glencoe Camp. The cloud was drifting up, and it could not be long before it would burst.|$|E

30|$|Figure  8 a {{shows that}} contact {{pressure}} is almost uniformly developed {{on the back}} of the <b>top</b> <b>angle’s</b> vertical leg under the bolt head area by the bolt tightening force and the contact nodal forces are moved to the upper area of the left-hand side of vertical leg as the connection moment increased up to the plastic range (Fig.  8 b, c). The contact pressure distribution on the column surface facing <b>top</b> <b>angle’s</b> vertical leg is accumulated at the upper area of the left-hand side of vertical leg. The resultant force due to the contact pressure is determined by summing up nodal forces developed on the contact surface that was defined as slave surface in contact definition between the two surfaces. This resultant is located in the contact area at a distance b from the centerline of bolt hole at the ultimate state of the connection (Fig.  9). It should be noted that this contact pressure resultant at the ultimate state of a connection should be considered as the prying force.|$|R

Six full-scale <b>top</b> and seat <b>angles</b> with double web angle bolted connections were tested. Static vertical load was applied until the specimens to reach a condition that cannot resist any additional load after that. In parallel, a finite element analysis was developed to simulate the aforementioned test and in particular, to determine the contact area between the <b>top</b> <b>angles</b> with the column flange, given rise to additional forces, the so-called prying forces. The finite element results were compared to the experimental ones and to those derived theoretically from the application of a model that recently has been proposed in the literature...|$|R

In parallax, the triangle is extremely long and narrow, and by measuring both its shortest side (the motion of the observer) and the small <b>top</b> <b>angle</b> (always less than 1 arcsecond, leaving the other two close to 90 degrees), the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and simple (pin) connections. In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and simple connections cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and simple connections have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of <b>top</b> and seat <b>angle</b> available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical <b>top</b> and seat <b>angle</b> connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as <b>top</b> and seat <b>angle</b> connection with bracket and <b>top</b> and seat <b>angle</b> connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top and seat connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of <b>top</b> and seat <b>angle</b> connection increased when attached bracket or gusset plate in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|R

5000|$|When {{introducing}} the iPhone 4, Steve Jobs said {{the number of}} pixels needed for a Retina Display is about 300 PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye. One way of expressing this as a unit is pixels-per-degree (PPD) which takes into account both the screen resolution and the distance from which the device is viewed. Based on Jobs' predicted number of 300, the threshold for a Retina Display starts at the PPD value of 57 PPD. 57 PPD means that a tall skinny triangle with a height equal to the viewing distance and a <b>top</b> <b>angle</b> of one degree will have a base on the device's screen that covers 57 pixels. Any display's viewing quality (from phone displays to huge projectors) can be described with this size-independent universal parameter. Note that the PPD parameter is not an intrinsic parameter of the display itself, unlike absolute pixel resolution (e.g. 1920×1080 pixels) or relative pixel density (e.g. 401 PPI), but {{is dependent on the}} distance between the display and the eye of the person (or lens of the device) viewing the display; moving the eye closer to the display reduces the PPD, and moving away from it increases the PPD in proportion to the distance.It can be calculated by the formulawhere [...] is the distance to the screen, [...] is the resolution of the screen in pixels per unit length, and [...] is the aperture of a cone having the apex on focus, height , and the base in the eye lens [...] - the optical correspondent to a cone inside the eye having the same base and the apex in the other focus, the fovea. That aperture, which can be measured by visual field tests, varies widely among different human subjects.|$|E
50|$|Kathantara {{seemingly}} {{looks like}} a very simple film but it does pack {{in a lot of}} issues and is multi-layered and rich in subtexts. One just wished that its treatment also reflected the same richness, but unfortunately it does not. The camera work of Sameer Mahajan does manage to capture the landscape of Orissa in all its expansive beauty. One is particularly impressed by a sequence where in one long take the character of Rupa enters her house from outside at dusk; the camera which is placed at the door, pans left along with her as she enters her room, interacts with her husband who is lying on a bed in long shot, and he gets up and walks out of the house while the camera holds on to her in the foreground. The outdoor and indoor matching of lights in the sequence is quite an impressive stroke and the mise-en-scene is quite noteworthy. But otherwise, overall, the mise-en-scenes are too simplistic and the scenes too informative. Specially the scenes inside the Kolkata hotel room; they are too rudimentary and bland, shot mostly in <b>top</b> <b>angle</b> mid-long shots. In fact the entire film has a propensity for long takes and long and mid-long shots and is peculiarly averse to close-ups. The ride from Howrah station to the hotel in a taxi (which does not have a meter!) fails to capture the essence of the big city; it is left to the lead characters to speak about its enormity and monotony instead. At places the film is too loaded with dialogues, which are solely meant to convey information, quite often superfluous; and what makes matters worse is that they are stilted, specially the Bengali lines spoken by Dipankar. Also, the actor playing Dipankar tries hard to deliver but falls far short of expectation. With his full-sleeved dull coloured shirts tucked inside dark pleated pants, he {{looks like a}} stuffed bureaucrat and lacks the flamboyance or mannerisms of a television journalist. In fact, he affects the entire look of the film. The only saving grace are the two actresses even if Anu Choudhury in the role of Kalpana looks too urbane and her starched cotton printed sarees do not help matters in lending her character the required rural look that was so necessary for the film. But her face has an elegance and sublime quality and her fine performance compensates for these shortcomings and one wishes there were at least some close-ups of her beautiful face.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of beam-column joint {{plays an}} important role in the response of a steel moment resisting framed structure especially under seismic excitation. Semi rigid connections like bolted joints, allow better energy dissipation and provide good response under lateral loads. In this paper the ductility and energy dissipation characteristics of semi rigid bolted connections using double web <b>angle</b> with <b>top</b> and seat <b>angles</b> is discussed based on experimental investigation. Non-linear analysis was also performed using finite element method to compare the results. The study revealed that ductile behaviour of beam-column connection is improved by increasing the number of bolts on the <b>top</b> and seat <b>angles</b> and the thickness of <b>top</b> and seat <b>angles.</b> The analytical results are in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

30|$|In {{the cases}} of Type I and Type II mechanisms, {{it is assumed that}} the prying force {{develops}} in between the centerline of bolt hole and the top edge of the <b>top</b> <b>angle</b> (Ahmed and Hasan 2015), and the prying force and beam flange force (hereinafter, indicated as shear force) are determined considering the location of the prying force and the plastic moment capacity at the plastic hinges of the <b>top</b> <b>angle.</b> The least value of shear force among those estimated from these three mechanisms is taken as the shear resistance of a given connection and is used to evaluate the ultimate moment capacity of that connection.|$|E
