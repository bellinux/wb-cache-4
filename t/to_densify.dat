25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is <b>to</b> <b>densify</b> the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product.

In our previous study, OHT was successfully applied <b>to</b> <b>densified</b> veneer, which resulted in improved dimensional stability. In the present study, the impact of OHT on densified wood veneer hygroscopicity and mechanical properties was determined. OHT at 180, 200, and 220 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 hours was applied <b>to</b> <b>densified</b> Aspen (Populus tremuloides) veneers.

However, due to the contribution of densification, the hardness of oil-heat treated veneers was still two to three times higher than that of non-densified veneers. Similar results were found for tensile strength. Bending strength increased slightly at low OHT temperature, and then decreased at high temperature. Bending strength of oil-heat treated densified veneer samples was higher than that of non-densified ones. No significant effect of OHT was found on tensile MOE, but bending MOE increased after OHT.

40|$|AbstractHot {{isostatic}} compression {{involves the}} simultaneous {{application of pressure}} and elevated temperature to materials. The pressure applied, usually by a gas, is isostatic because it's developed in a suitable pressurized vessel by a fluid. Therefore in prin ciple no alteration in component geometry occurs. Under these conditions of heat and pressure, internal pores or defects within a solid body or a powder compact collapse and weld up. Encapsulated powder and sintered components densify easily and faster than due to sintering alone. Therefore HIP is today used {{for a lot of}} applications, like upgrading castings (removing shrinkage pores in interdendritic space), densifying pre-sintered components, consolidation of powders and interfacial bonding.

In particular, the density values of both control samples and the samples densified at a low compression ratio (20 %) decreased {{as a result of}} the increase in temperature of the thermal treatment. The minimum density value (0.550  g/cm 3) was identified in the undensified samples thermally treated at 212  °C. In the samples densified at the high compression ratio (40 %), an increase of the thermal post-treatment temperature influenced density values positively (Table  3; Fig.  1).

Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures.

5000|$|... 3D {{printing}} {{is being}} explored {{as a possible}} manufacturing technique {{that could be used}} to make SOFC manufacturing easier by the Shah Lab at Northwestern University. This manufacturing technique would allow SOFC cell structure to be more flexible, which could lead to more efficient designs. This process could work in the production of any part of the cell. The 3D printing process works by combining about 80% ceramic particles with 20% binders and solvents, and then converting that slurry into an ink that can be fed into a 3D printer. Some of the solvent is very volatile, so the ceramic ink solidifies almost immediately. Not all of the solvent evaporates, so the ink maintains some flexibility before it is fired at high temperature <b>to</b> <b>densify</b> it. This flexibility allows the cells to be fired in a circular shape that would increase the surface area over which electrochemical reactions can occur, which increases the efficiency of the cell. Also, the 3D printing technique allows the cell layers to be printed on top of each other instead of having to go through separate manufacturing and stacking steps. The thickness is easy to control, and layers can be made in the exact size and shape that is needed, so waste is minimized.|$|E
