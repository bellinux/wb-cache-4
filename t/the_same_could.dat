5|$|The {{sponsorship}} of Boit and Bitok consisted of $200,000, {{to cover their}} training, accommodation and equipment while in Finland. The logic had been that since Nike sent Finnish runners were sent to Kenya to train, then <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> be done in reverse. Following their training, both athletes tried {{to qualify for the}} Winter Olympics, but failed to do so. Instead, Kenya opted to use a single automatic qualification spot to send Boit to the Games in 1998. Shortly prior to the Games, Boit missed two weeks of training when he was hospitalised with a stomach problem.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E

Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be said for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E
25|$|The Celestial Masters' {{activities}} did {{hasten the}} downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now Sichuan province. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> be said of their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning Yellow Turban sect.|$|E
25|$|Formed {{out of the}} Society for the Reformation of Pashtuns (Anjuman-e-Islah-e-Afghan), it {{initially}} targeted social reformation {{and launched}} campaigns against prostitution.

25|$|The works not {{assigned}} {{as a part}} of Cassiodorus's {{educational program}} must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of protecting himself. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> easily be said about his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening in their approach to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.|$|E

He wrote an article against indigo merchants and sent it for publication in the Hindu Patriot but <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be published owing to the untimely death of its editor, Harish Chandra Mukherjee. He joined Presidency College in 1861 and while a student there, he developed a friendship with Keshub Chunder Sen. Together they started the Indian Mirror.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{ruled in}} {{accordance}} to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy.

25|$|Planning {{permission}} for the competing Tesco {{development on the}} opposite side of the A2 road had been granted on 28 November 1998. Following the quashing of planning {{permission for}} D5 its developers sought judicial review of the permission granted to Tesco, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> apply to that development, however this was refused on 17 September 1999. This judgement was slightly controversial, given that the judge refused to rescind planning permission solely because the £13million Tesco store was almost complete.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> be {{said for}} Lillywhite’s team which, being {{selected}} from only four counties, meant that some of England’s best players did not take part. In addition, the team had a rough voyage back across the Tasman Sea and many members had been seasick. The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered. On top of that, wicket-keeper Ted Pooley was still in a New Zealand prison after a brawl in a Christchurch pub.|$|E
25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be said about the Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E
25|$|The Governor {{had failed}} to take an {{accurate}} territorial census before the first election of representatives to help ensure valid results. The February 1855 census showed 36 residents in Pawnee, but 75 votes were cast there in the March 30 election, held {{at the home of}} Robert Klotz. The number reflected emigrants who had arrived within that month, and election returns indicated no illegal voters at Pawnee. But <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be said at polling places throughout {{much of the rest of}} the territory, as more than 800 illegal votes were identified in both Lawrence and Leavenworth and more than 4,000 territory-wide.|$|E

25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Mac and Rachel {{were married}} on Valentine's Day 1975. Mac {{accepted}} Jamie {{as his own}} child, but <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be said for Rachel and Mac's daughter, Iris Carrington (Beverlee McKinsey). Iris was a glamorous socialite who had left her husband, Eliot (James Douglas), and their son, Dennis (Mike Hammett), to go jet-setting. She was insanely jealous and resented Rachel, who she saw as beneath her family. The drama produced by Iris interfering in Mac and Rachel's marriage carried the show {{for the rest of}} the '70s. Iris pulled numerous schemes to drive Rachel and Mac apart, but, unfortunately for her, they often backfired. After the birth of Mac and Rachel's daughter, Amanda (Nicole Catalanotto), it was revealed that Iris was adopted, which devastated her.|$|E
25|$|Edgerton {{was born}} in Cazenovia, New York, on August 17, 1818. His parents were Amos and Zerviah (Graham) Edgerton, both of Connecticut. Zerviah was a cousin of millionaire philanthropist Anson Greene Phelps. As a child, Edgerton was so sickly and frail that burial clothes were {{prepared}} for him. Whereas the young Edgerton avoided death, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>could</b> not be said for his father, a teacher by trade who had been blind for years. Amos Edgerton died when Sidney was still an infant. Left with six children to raise, Zerviah Edgerton struggled to maintain her family. By age eight, young Sidney {{was out of the}} home and working himself through school. He eventually attended the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York, where his cousin taught, and where he would later become an instructor as well.|$|E
