60|$|Honest Montaigne goes yet farther: Nous ne sommes que ceremonie; la ceremonie nous emporte, et laissons la {{substance}} des choses: Nous nous tenons aux branches, et abandonnons le <b>tronc</b> et le corps. Nous avons appris aux dames de rougir, oyans seulement nommer ce qu'elles ne craignent aucunement à faire; Nous n'esons appeller à droict nos membres, et ne craignons pas de les employer à toute sorte de debauche.

60|$|We {{were now}} shown {{into a room}} {{where there was a}} small {{collection}} of minerals, and of Roman remains found about the ruins of the temple. At seven we received {{a cup of coffee and}} some bread and butter, after which the prior entered, and invited us to look at the chapel, which is of moderate dimensions, and of plain ornaments. There is a box attached to a column, with <b>tronc</b> pour les pauvres, and as all the poor in this mountain are those who enjoy the hospitality of the convent, the hint was understood. We dropped a few francs into the hole, while the prior was looking earnestly the other way, and it then struck us we were at liberty to depart. The body of Desaix lies in this chapel, and there is a small tablet in it, erected to his memory.|$|E

6000|$|For German philosophers, {{who hold}} that Nature is [...] "petrified intelligence," [...] and that logical forms are the {{foundations}} of all things, it is a consistent hypothesis that as thought is serial, Nature is serial; but that M. Comte, who is so bitter an opponent of all anthropomorphism, even in its most evanescent shapes, should have committed the mistake of imposing upon the external world an arrangement which so obviously springs from a limitation of the human consciousness, is somewhat strange. And it is the more strange when we call to mind how, at the outset, M. Comte remarks that in the beginning [...] "toutes les sciences sont cultivées simultanément par les mêmes esprits;" [...] that this is [...] "inevitable et même indispensable;" [...] and how he further remarks that the different sciences are [...] "comme les diverses branches d'un <b>tronc</b> unique." [...] Were it not {{accounted for by the}} distorting influence of a cherished hypothesis, it would be scarcely possible to understand how, after recognising truths like these, M. Comte should have persisted in attempting to construct [...] "une échelle encyclopédique." ...|$|E

50|$|Dutilleux first {{encountered}} Cassou's poems in 1944, {{shortly after they}} were published. Ten years later, he reread them and decided to set to music two of them, for baritone and piano: Il n'y avait que des <b>troncs</b> déchirés (There was nothing but torn trunks) and J'ai rêvé que je vous portais entre mes bras (I dreamed that I carried you in my arms). The songs are markedly contrasted. The first one is violent and depicts a ruined castle, the second one is calm and dream-like, a remembrance of past love.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tronc's</b> history {{dates back}} to 1847; when the Chicago Tribune (for which {{the company and its}} former parent, Tribune Media, are named) {{published}} its first edition on June 10 of that year, in a one-room plant located at LaSalle and Lake Streets in Chicago. The Tribune constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn Street (Chicago)|Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869; however the building was destroyed, along with most of the city, by the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871. The Tribune resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring [...] "Chicago Shall Rise Again". The newspaper's editor and part-owner, Joseph Medill, was elected mayor and led the city's reconstruction. A native Ohioan who first acquired an interest in the Tribune in 1855, Medill gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tronc</b> is an {{arrangement}} for the pooling and distribution to employees of tips, gratuities and/or service {{charges in the}} hotel and catering trade.
