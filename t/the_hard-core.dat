25|$|Converse et al. (1969) {{assesses the}} {{significance}} of the 1968 presidential election. Many people were dissatisfied with Johnson but not with the Democratic Party. Their dissatisfaction was connected to the Vietnam War, civil rights, and law and order. Humphrey, the choice of an older generation, suffered from identification with the Johnson administration. Wallace attracted many Richard Nixon-bound Democrats and thus was a threat to Nixon. McCarthy's popularity in the New Hampshire primary was a nondifferentiated anti-Johnson vote from which many voters went to Wallace. These were not, however, <b>the</b> <b>hard-core</b> McCarthyite followers. Wallace's success {{was the result of the}} voter's identification with his stand on the primary issues – continuing segregation, getting out of Vietnam, a focus on liberal economic policies and law and order. Wallace's supporters were rural and small town residents in the South and skilled labor in the North. They were disgusted with public policy and were often alienated from politics.|$|E

The game did not generate much excitement in either America or Japan, {{although it is}} thought to have appealed to younger fans. The game ultimately failed in its bid to bring mainstream North American popularity to console RPGs (a feat that wouldn't be accomplished until Final Fantasy VII five years later), and simultaneously alienated fans of the series anticipating another epic following Final Fantasy IV.

The sound-recording, cinematography, and story-line of The Devil in Miss Jones were of a considerably higher quality than any previous porn film. The lead, Georgina Spelvin, who had been in the original Broadway run of The Pajama Game, combined vigorous sex with an acting performance some thought as convincing as anything to be seen in a good mainstream production.

2500|$|Despite its {{simplifying}} nature, {{the independence}} {{property of the}} Poisson process {{has been criticized for}} not realistically representing the configuration of deployed networks. For example, it does not capture node [...] "repulsion" [...] where two (or more) nodes in a wireless network may not be normally placed (arbitrarily) close to each other (for examples, base stations in a cellular network). In addition to this, MAC protocols often induce correlations or non-Poisson configurations into the geometry of the simultaneously active transmitter pattern. Strong correlations also arise in the case of cognitive radio networks where secondary transmitters are only allowed to transmit if they far from primary receivers. To answer these and other criticisms, a number of point processes have been suggested to represent the positioning of nodes including the binomial process, cluster processes, Matérn hard-core processes, and Strauss and Ginibre processes. For example, Matérn hard-core processes are constructed by dependently thinning a [...] Poisson point process. The dependent thinning is done in way such that for any point in the resulting hard-core process, there are no other points within a certain set radius of it, thus creating a [...] "hard-core" [...] around each point in the process. [...] On the other hand, soft-core processes have point repulsion that ranges somewhere between <b>the</b> <b>hard-core</b> processes and Poisson processes (which have no repulsion). More specifically, the probability of a point existing near another point in a soft-core point process decreases in some way as it approaches the other point, thus creating a [...] "soft-core" [...] around each point where other points can exist, but are less likely.|$|E

The keyboard functionality was [...] "designed basically {{to answer that}} staleness factor" [...] that has been seen in music games, as said by Sussman.

Pro keys, on the other hand, was designed so that it would be fun playing the accurate actual notes of the song. The team also included Pro mode to help invigorate existing players to give them new challenges, aimed at those that [...] "had any aspirations of connecting with the music in a deeper way", according to senior designer Sylvain Dubrofsky. Sussman commented that the combination of existing and new gameplay modes provides [...] "an experience that is both accessible to players who are just getting into this thing, and builds something for <b>the</b> <b>hard-core</b> player who is maybe a little bored with where music games are". Sussman noted that there still remains a large gap between mastering the Pro modes and playing real instruments: [...] "We see Pro as a different experience from the five-button simulation, but not necessarily a track to expertise." [...] Sussman further commented that inclusion of Pro mode, particularly at higher difficulty levels, was [...] "because it shows the potential ceiling of where this can take you". However, Harmonix was still dedicated to helping to [...] "open doors" [...] for players interested in learning real musical instruments, such as by including appropriate music fundamentals that can be used outside of the game. Harmonix created the Pro Guitar charts for songs through careful audio interpretation of master tracks and through watching live performances of the songs to ensure they were using the correct chords.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} briefly reviews {{some recent}} work demonstrating the partial {{breakdown of the}} colloidal fluid atomic fluid analogy. The success of liquid state theory for atomic fluids stems {{in part from the}} van der Waals picture, where steric interactions dominate the structure, and attractive interactions can be added as a perturbation. For complex fluids described by effective potentials, this picture may break down. In the first example discussed, depletion potentials in non-additive hard-sphere mixtures are shown to be surprisingly complex, leading to fluid structure and fluid-solid transitions dominated by properties of the attractive potentials instead of by <b>the</b> <b>hard-cores.</b> Many colloidal suspensions, and possibly globular proteins, fall into this energetic fluid category. In the second example, the coarse-graining of polymers leads to soft-core effective potentials and associated mean field fluid behaviour distinguished by a breakdown of the virial expansion, an equation of state that is nevertheless nearly linear in density, and correlation functions well described by the random phase approximation.
