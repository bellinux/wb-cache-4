After being added to various soil mixtures, the {{mutualism}} can begin as seedlings are grown in nurseries or plantations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> becoming quite commonplace, and there are many companies that are beginning to sell a variety of mycorrhizal inoculum, Pisolithus tinctorius being quite widespread among the EcM fungi.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} working pressures in depleted reservoirs, about 50 percent of the natural gas in the formation must be kept as cushion gas. However, since depleted reservoirs were previously filled with natural gas and hydrocarbons, they do not require the injection of gas that will become physically unrecoverable as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> present in the formation. This provides a further economic boost {{for this type of}} facility, particularly when the cost of gas is high.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation {{can be reduced to}} a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{science of}} negative-index {{materials}} is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that travel over cables, wires, or air. The materials, devices and {{systems that are}} involved with this work could have their properties altered or heightened. Hence, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> happening with metamaterial antennas and related devices which are commercially available. Moreover, in the wireless domain these metamaterial apparatuses continue to be researched. Other applications are also being researched. These are electromagnetic absorbers such as radar-microwave absorbers, electrically small resonators, waveguides that can go beyond the diffraction limit, phase compensators, advancements in focusing devices (e.g. microwave lens), and improved electrically small antennas.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E

25|$|His {{word has}} given {{warning of the}} {{impending}} danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when {{it is too late}} to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.|$|E
