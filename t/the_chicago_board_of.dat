5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations.

Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality.
