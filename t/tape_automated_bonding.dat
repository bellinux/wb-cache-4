To meet these demands, strong interfacial adhesion between the ACF, sub-strate, and chip is a major issue. We have developed a multilayered ACF that has functional layers on both sides of a conventional ACF layer to improve the wetting properties of the resin on two-layer ex for better interface adhesion and to control the ow of conductive particles during thermocompression bond-ing and the resulting reliability of the interconnection using ACF.

40|$|Mismatch between outer lead bonds (OLBs) of a <b>tape</b> <b>automated</b> <b>bonding</b> (TAB) and a {{glass panel}} during {{fabrication}} is studied using the finite element method. A two-dimensional finite element model for the TAB-on Glass (TOG) connector is presented for determining the deformation of the connector. The deformation of the TOG connector induced by residual thermal stresses are determined via a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the TOG connector is under heat and pressure. The anisotropic conductive film (ACF) in-between the TAB and glass panel {{is assumed to be}} in a melting condition so that both TAB and glass panel can expand freely. At the second stage, the connector is cooled down to room temperature and the ACF becomes solidified. The deformations of the connector at the two stages are determined in the finite element analysis in which the temperature dependence of material properties is considered. Effects of particular parameters on the mismatch between the OLBs are studied by means of a number of numerical examples. A method for compensation design of the lead locations of the OLBs is proposed. It has been shown that the compensation design can produce results that will avoid the occurrence of unwanted mismatch. 1...|$|E

30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the cured parts, release agents are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external release agents are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, release agent residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a release agent transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These release agent residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially <b>automated</b> <b>bonding</b> pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|R

Since the last reports (Snowmass LHC workshop ’ 99) considerable {{progress has been made}} and designs have been refined and adapted to facilitate production, which will start early next year. This paper describes the design of the three major interconnection parts: • The TAB-frame chipcable connects the front-end chips to the detector and to the flex. These cables are mounted in carrier frames for testing and have unique coding to identify cable type as well as coding to check correct alignment in the test connector. • The flex is essentially a multi-layer interconnecting bus supplying power and control to the front-end chips, with integrated LVDS terminating resistors. The flex is the constructive basis of the hybrid, SMD components can be mounted by soldering or gluing as well as by means of TAB bonds. Ultrasonic bonding and pulsed-bar reflow soldering techniques are used to interconnect the flex to the other parts. • The laddercable is a 60 cm long cable connecting the front-end modules to the endcaps. This flatcable is designed as a differential stripline for analog and LVDS signals using ultra-low density polyimide foam as spacer material.

40|$|The Boeing Company has {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} <b>Tape</b> <b>Automated</b> <b>Bonding</b> (TAB) and Surface Mount Technology (SMT) for a highly reliable, low cost interconnect for concentrator solar cell arrays. TAB and SMT are currently used in the electronics industry for chip interconnects and printed circuit board assembly. TAB tape consists of sixty-four 3 -mil/ 1 -oz tin-plated copper leads on 8 -mil centers. The leads are thermocompression gang bonded to GaAs concentrator solar cell with silver contacts. This bond, known as an Inner Lead Bond (ILB), allows for pretesting and sorting capability via nondestruct wire bond pull and flash testing. Destructive wire pull tests resulted in preferred mid-span failures. Improvements in fill factor were attributed to decreased contact resistance on TAB bonded cells. Preliminary thermal cycling and aging tests were shown excellent bond strength and metallurgical results. Auger scans of bond sites reveals an Ag-Cu-Tin composition. Improper bonds are identified through flash testing as a performance degradation. On going testing of cells are underway at Lewis Research Center. SMT techniques are utilized to excise and form TAB leads post ILB. The formed leads' shape isolates thermal mismatches between the cells and the flex circuit they are mounted on. TABed cells are picked and placed with a gantry x-y-z positioning system with pattern recognition. Adhesives are selected to avoid thermal expansion mismatch and promote thermal transfer to the flex circuit. TAB outer lead bonds are parallel gap welded (PGW) to the flex circuit to finish the concentrator solar cell subassembly...|$|E

The {{goal was to}} provide a management tool for making yield projections, resource allocations, understanding operating practices, and performing what-if analyses. The model was developed using a series of case studies of packages entering manufacturing. These studies were a tape carrier package (TCP) at Intel, Chandler, AZ, a ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) and plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) at IBM, Bromont, P. Q., Canada, and a plastic ball grid array (PBGA) at Motorola, Austin, TX. These packages covered a wide range of technologies, including liquid and overmolded encapsulation, wirebond and controlled collapsed chip connection (C 4) chip connections, and <b>tape</b> <b>automated</b> <b>bonding</b> (TAB), ceramic, laminate, and leadframe substrates. The factors that affect yield learning rates (e. g. process complexity, production volumes, personnel experience) were identified and a nonlinear spreadsheet-based response surface model was built. The model separates out the underlying chronic yield from excursions due to human error, equipment failure, etc. The model has been shown to accurately predict the yield ramp {{as a function of the}} factor values. One of the conclusions of this work is that all of the very dissimilar assembly processes had very similar factors, with very similar factor sensitivities and rankings in terms of how each affected the yield learning rate. In all cases, the most important factors were operator experience, changes in line volume, types of work teams, process complexity, equipment upgrades, and technology type. Since the yield ramp for a new product will hopefully be short, the model must be calibrated for a particular product very quickly. We have developed a graphical interface an [...] ...|$|E
