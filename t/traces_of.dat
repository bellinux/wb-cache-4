There is also a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> another line in the cell, and a fair sized mark on the inner margin. There is a <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> two very short black costal dashes beyond the cell, followed by a black wedge-shaped costal mark. A bare <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> a black subterminal line is mainly noticeable by a fair sized black mark on the inner margin almost in the tornus. The hindwings are uniform white.|$|R

50|$|Given some linear map f : V → V (where V is a finite-dimensional vector space) generally, we {{can define}} the <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> this map by {{considering}} the <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> matrix representation of f, that is, choosing a basis for V and describing f as a matrix relative to this basis, and taking the <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> this square matrix. The result will {{not depend on the}} basis chosen, since different bases will give rise to similar matrices, allowing for the possibility of a basis-independent definition for the <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> a linear map.|$|R

5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. <b>Traces</b> <b>of</b> painted decoration were found in the nave, including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.|$|E
