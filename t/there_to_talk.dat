5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
25|$|The Graham Norton Show {{based in}} UK has invited Gervais {{many times over}} the years. He has been on Norton's couch with Stephen Merchant, the co-creator & co-writer of The Office, to promote Cemetery Junction. Another time, he was <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his series Life's Too Short and Johnny Depp who was there to promote his own film was also present.|$|E
25|$|The loft, {{located in}} Toronto's Entertainment District near the {{intersection}} of Peter and Richmond streets, had 21 cameras filming 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in all rooms of the house including the bathrooms, although the bathroom camera was only broadcast if Lofters went in <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> The full live stream could be viewed at U8TV.com, while Life Network broadcast a nightly episode to recap the day's highlights.|$|E

5000|$|His {{first book}} was the novella-length What <b>To</b> <b>Talk</b> About When <b>There’s</b> Nothing <b>To</b> <b>Talk</b> About, {{designed}} <b>to</b> {{help those who}} struggle to have anything <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about at social events, such as dinner parties, where conversation is imperative.|$|R
500|$|On another occasion, {{a prostitute}} {{was brought to}} Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the sex worker, asking why she was a prostitute, whether {{she wanted to have}} sex with him, and how much it would cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him. The prostitute then {{proceeded}} to unbutton her blouse, exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to [...] "put them back". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to [...] "get off". Jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left, stating that he would perhaps call her one day, though he never did.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after noon}} on August 14, 1980, Snider and Stratten met at Snider's house, {{where the two}} had once lived as a couple, and which Snider was by then sharing with its owner, their mutual friend, Dr. Stephen Cushner. Stratten had gone <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about an amicable divorce and took along $1,000 to give to Snider.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is an {{extremely}} attractive girl," [...] she said; and added, [...] "to some people. Of course, one doesn't like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about things until <b>there</b> are things <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|R

50|$|Kennedy was outspoken in {{his views}} about Northern Ireland's {{constitutional}} question. In October 1971, {{he called for}} the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland, and for all political participants <b>there</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>talks</b> on creating a United Ireland.|$|R
2500|$|Kimiko and Miho are in {{the same}} diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has {{disrupted}} his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Kimiko. [...] After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone. [...] Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, Sight. Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.|$|E
6000|$|The pretty boy {{bowed to}} each in turn, {{but he made}} no pretence of being <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Ellen. [...] "Have you been ill, too?" [...] he {{actively}} addressed himself to Lottie.|$|E
6000|$|Cal. [...] Not I; for if I did so, [...] Thou wouldst not now be <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of trust: [...] It is thy softness, not thy want of faith, [...] Which makes thee to be doubted.|$|E
50|$|If {{your friend}} isn't <b>there</b> then <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a {{different}} friend of yours.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Mother, I'll find her," [...] replied Pan happily. [...] "We'll be in <b>to</b> dinner pronto. <b>There's</b> a lot <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. Dad {{will tell}} you." ...|$|R
50|$|From October 2007 <b>to</b> February 2008 <b>there</b> were <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> {{merge with}} First Milk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder whether}} you love anybody, {{and whether he}} loves you,' said Marie. Hetta {{certainly}} had not come <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of her own affairs, and made no reply to this. 'I suppose you won't tell me about yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{sit on the}} doorstep. But what is <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about? You don't {{want your}} rabbits {{tortured}} so that somebody may make thirty cents apiece. It {{has got to be}} stopped, and why not stop it now? Where does the fellow live?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{appeared}} {{only too}} {{evident that the}} two old friends were again {{on the verge of}} one of their distressing fallings-out: but Jane Hubbard intervened once more. This practical-minded girl disliked the introducing of side-issues into the conversation. She was <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about burglars, and she intended to do so.|$|E
60|$|L. You are {{all such}} wise children, <b>there's</b> no <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you; you won't believe anything.|$|R
60|$|He hobbled in at Merevale's gate, {{and went}} up to his study. The Babe was in <b>there</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Welch.|$|R
60|$|So the fairies, and knooks, and pixies, and ryls all escorted {{the good}} man to his castle, and <b>there</b> left him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over {{the events of}} the night with his little assistants.|$|R
6000|$|... "C'est juste," [...] cried she {{with an air}} of bonté; and she kindly {{recommended}} me {{to confine}} myself to it as much as I chose, saying, that as I was not charged with the surveillance, I need not trouble myself to walk with the pupils: only I might permit her children to come <b>there,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> English with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the beginning," [...] he {{announced}} triumphantly. [...] "And I'm {{going to stop}} in the porch and talk as long as there's anybody <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. I'm going to squirm and wriggle and whisper, and I'm going to say I don't know the Golden Text. And I'm going to throw away both of my collections RIGHT NOW." ...|$|E
60|$|She had but one jealousy--he {{admired and}} trusted Mrs. Baker and {{occasionally}} rode over <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her, and Fan {{could not understand}} that he sought intellectual refuge from the mental squalor of the Blondells, but she perceived a difference in his glance on his return. Mrs. Baker, being a keen-sighted, practical little woman, soon fell upon the plainest kind of speech with the young Englishman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that. I {{like the}} {{excitement}} of facing danger boldly. But <b>there's</b> ample time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over details. I see you've had your supper, so I'll just fry myself a beefsteak." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s <b>there</b> were <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> {{build an}} artist village in Britannia's hills, but that plan did not proceed.|$|R
6000|$|It was Lapham who resumed the talk. [...] "I'm {{afraid we}} can't {{either of us}} see this thing in the right light. We're too near to it. I wish <b>to</b> the Lord <b>there</b> was {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{came in a}} tall, large, handsome, dashing-looking man, {{with the}} air of a [...] "beau sabreur," [...] whom Lady Belamour {{presented}} to her cousins as [...] "Colonel Mar, my son's commandant, you know who has been kind enough to take Carminster on his way, so as to escort me to the Bath. I am such a sad coward about highwaymen. And we are to meet dear Lady Aresfield <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over a little matter of business." ...|$|E
60|$|L. Yes, {{it is very}} absurd. The {{quite right}} thing, I believe, is to go <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> I confess, however, that in most music, when very well done, the doing of it is to me the chiefly {{interesting}} part of the business. I'm always thinking how good {{it would be for}} the fat, supercilious people, who care so little for their half- crown's worth, to be set to try and do a half-crown's worth of anything like it.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps our {{dullness}} may {{be accounted}} for by {{the fact that there was}} so much of excitement on this night and the next day, that we hardly had time to think of ourselves. Those yet remaining in Boston, who were devoted to the Cause, gathered here and <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over what at the same time brought us sorrow and rejoicing--sorrow that so many of our people had been slaughtered, and rejoicing that the struggle against British misrule had finally begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have it!" [...] Hazard's face lighted up {{with the}} coming of understanding. [...] "I have it! That fellow up <b>there</b> is trying <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us. He's {{flashing}} the sunlight down to us on a pocket-mirror--dot, dash; dot, dash; don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Cambridge <b>there</b> {{are people}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to," [...] Helen echoed him, rhythmically and absent-mindedly. Then she woke up. [...] "By the way, have you settled what you're going to do--is {{it to be}} Cambridge or the Bar?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then the damsel Elose fled {{away from}} that place, lest those who would come to slay Sir Ewaine should find her <b>there</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
