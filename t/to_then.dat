5000|$|Next, {{there is}} the often {{confusing}} question as to {{the order in which}} payments are to be applied. In simple interest situations, the possibilities are (1) apply a payment first <b>to</b> interest, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> principal; (2) apply a payment first <b>to</b> principal, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> interest; (3) apply a payment first to the current month's obligation, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> interest, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> principal. There is fourth payment allocation description in use in some states (e.g. California Code of Civil Procedure Section 695.221, effective January 1, 2009) which calls for payment [...] "first <b>to</b> current month, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> principal, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> interest." [...] In fact, however, this method of allocation is mathematically the same as method #2 above - first <b>to</b> principal, <b>then</b> <b>to</b> interest - for the reason the current month's obligation becomes part of the principal immediately upon falling due.|$|R

5|$|The {{objectives}} of the German, Austrian and Ottoman advance were to capture Romani and <b>to</b> <b>then</b> establish a strongly entrenched position opposite Kantara, from which place their heavy artillery would be within range of the Suez Canal. The attacking force assembled in the southern Ottoman Empire at Shellal, north-west of Beersheba, and departed for the Sinai on 9 July 1916; they reached Bir el Abd and Ogratina ten days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{success of}} the Ottoman Army's operations during the Battle of Katia demonstrated the attacking strength and determination of Kress von Kressenstein's force in 1916, and their efficient implementation of appropriate tactics, particularly timing and false intelligence. This success was underpinned by the Ottoman infantry's ability to make the gruelling march across the Sinai Peninsula and be fit enough <b>to</b> <b>then</b> launch attacks with force and determination.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up <b>to</b> <b>then</b> there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up <b>to</b> <b>then</b> charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E

With his fourth goal in five matches, he equalised in a 2–2 draw away <b>to</b> <b>then</b> league leaders AFC Bournemouth on 10 February 2015. Bent scored 12 goals from 17 appearances as Derby finished in eighth place in the Championship table, missing out on a play-off place by one point.

5|$|An {{apartment}} on the 16th and 17th floors has been the official residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001. These two floors, the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery, had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite. There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence. In 1994, the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it <b>to</b> <b>then</b> premier Jacques Parizeau. There were issues of security and neighbour relationships, however, and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it. He {{lived in a small}} {{apartment on}} Parliament Hill for most of his mandate.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was <b>to</b> <b>then</b> bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at {{the outbreak}} of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased in the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up <b>to</b> <b>then</b> most Irish-registered ships had been flying the red ensign of the United Kingdom Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the Red Ensign, but some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With {{the outbreak of}} hostilities, choices were forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which could be described as British also choose the Tricolour. Kerrymore, which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour.|$|E

After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up <b>to</b> <b>then</b> had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops who fired on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd <b>to</b> <b>then</b> find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon {{from both sides of the}} river. Others who saw this turned back to the city in despair.|$|E
