25|$|For {{incidentally}} discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound {{by their}} pathognomonic echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, {{which have a}} crumpled <b>tissue-paper</b> appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E
2500|$|... "The French Revolution first {{introduced}} into Europe {{the notion of}} the <b>tissue-paper</b> frontier. [...] Hitherto, all boundaries had been marshes, forests, mountains, dikes; that is to say, significant boundaries. [...] But when boundaries can be drawn on paper, they need have no more significance than the stroke of a pen or a piece of chalk." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{management}} of Ngee Ann City [...] "called the police more than 30 times" [...] in early 2017, alleging that Zeng was [...] "masquerading as a cripple to sell <b>tissue-paper</b> packs"; Zeng countered {{that they were}} simply [...] "not happy" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] and dismissed their allegations as [...] "nonsense". Additionally, a notice urging passers-by not to donate to Zeng was put up by the mall. Zeng was charged with begging, using abusive language on a police officer, and assaulting a Ngee Ann City security officer.|$|E

6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] He {{nods his}} head toward the frosty panes, and wraps a sheet of <b>tissue-paper</b> around the cotton and the flowers.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "No {{irrelevant}} insults, Mrs. Campbell, if you please! Now, Agnes, try {{to collect}} yourself. When you had folded his dress-suit in <b>tissue-paper</b> so nicely, {{what did you}} do with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She drew it {{forth from}} her purse, {{carefully}} but loosely {{wrapped up in}} a small tag of <b>tissue-paper.</b> [...] "Here it is!" [...] she said, displaying it. [...] "Now, I want you to test it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{brought him}} back to himself, but without a start. Those sudden returns to fact had ceased to bewilder him; they were grown so common that he passed between dreams and reality as through <b>tissue-paper.</b>|$|E
6000|$|After a while {{coal and}} {{potatoes}} {{began to be}} awfully scarce, so many [...] had been wrapped up in <b>tissue-paper</b> to fool papas and mammas with. [...] Turkeys got to be about a thousand dollars apiece-- ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he began}} anew his fumblings and contortions. At last his efforts were rewarded by his producing, {{apparently}} from his right ear, a many-folded piece of <b>tissue-paper.</b> Unwrapping this carefully, he at last disclosed two twenty-dollar gold-pieces, which he handed to Mrs. Tretherick.|$|E
60|$|From {{the bottom}} of the craft had {{suddenly}} burst a cluster of red, white and blue <b>tissue-paper</b> streamers. These floated under and behind the Dartaway, producing a beautiful effect. Then suddenly came floating down through the air a quantity of many-colored confetti--tiny bits of pretty paper that settled everywhere.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "He {{can forgive}} you, probably, but he cannot forget; we must {{leave that to}} women. And here we were, searching every nook and corner of the house, and every hole and cranny, for that dress-suit, which you'd poked away in <b>tissue-paper</b> and Chuddah, while you were enjoying {{yourself}} at Mrs. Miller's." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{his pocket}} he drew {{and opened a}} leather case, from which he took an object wrapped in <b>tissue-paper.</b> Unwrapping it, he dropped into my hand a chip of pure soft gold, {{the size of a}} ten-dollar gold-piece. I could make out the greyish {{substance}} on one side with which it had been painted.|$|E
6000|$|He drew it {{from the}} zinc-well {{in which it was}} packed in moss and cotton-wool, and {{wondered}} what he should do with it. He could not leave such a thing about, nor would he take it away. Suddenly an idea struck him, and he repacked it in its case as carefully as he could in the original moss and cotton-wool, and then looked about for the sheet of <b>tissue-paper</b> that should complete the covering. He had destroyed it, and had to search for a substitute. In so doing his eye fell upon a long envelope on his dressing-table and he smiled. It contained his marriage licence, and he bethought him that it was a very fair substitute for <b>tissue-paper,</b> and quite as worthless. He extracted it, and, placing it over the flowers, closed up the box. Then he carefully directed it to [...] "Mrs. George Caresfoot, Abbey House," [...] and, ringing the bell, desired the boots to find a messenger to take it over.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she paused}} for water to cool the boiling radiator, the bug panted up, and with the first grin she had seen on his face since Dakota Milt chuckled, [...] "The Teal is a grand car for mountains. Aside from overheating, bum lights, thin upholstery, faulty ignition, <b>tissue-paper</b> brake-bands, and this-here special {{aviation}} engine, specially built for a bumble-bee, it's what the catalogues call a powerful brute!" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the outer}} office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and {{incidentally}} rubbed {{the side of his}} nose with a folded piece of <b>tissue-paper</b> that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.|$|E
60|$|When {{they stopped}} work that evening they {{surveyed}} their theatre {{with a great}} deal of pride; for it was now so nearly completed that any one could tell, at a very searching glance, what it was intended for. The scenery was all in its place, and Nelly had made a quantity of rosettes out of <b>tissue-paper</b> of various colors, which were to be fastened as ornaments on the rough, unpainted boards.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had found}} under the heavier {{wrapping}} {{a layer of}} <b>tissue-paper,</b> and under that a further envelope of linen, lightly stitched together. A knife blade quickly separated the stitches, and the linen was carefully unfolded. It displayed a beautifully trimmed evening dress of pale blue satin, with a dressing-gown of some exquisite white fabric armed with lace. The men gazed at it in silence, and then the one single expression broke from their lips,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Kim slunk away, {{his teeth}} in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a small wad of folded <b>tissue-paper</b> wrapped in oilskin, with three silver rupees--enormous largesse. He smiled and thrust money and paper into his leather amulet-case. The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub's Baltis, was already asleep {{in a corner of}} one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside him and laughed. He knew he had {{rendered}} a service to Mahbub Ali, and not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion's pedigree.|$|E
60|$|The road {{crosses the}} Yangma (which is about fifteen feet wide), and {{immediately}} ascends steeply to the south-east, over a rocky moraine, clothed with a dense thicket of rhododendrons, mountain-ash, maples, pine, birch, juniper, etc. The ground {{was covered with}} silvery flakes of birch bark, and that of Rhododendron Hodgsoni, which is as delicate as <b>tissue-paper,</b> and of a pale flesh-colour. I had never before met with this species, and was astonished at the beauty of its foliage, which was of a beautiful bright green, with leaves sixteen inches long.|$|E
6000|$|The two went {{round and}} ascended the crooked stair in {{darkness}} till Clym's sitting-room {{on the upper}} floor was reached, where he lit a candle, Charley entering gently behind. Yeobright searched his desk, and taking out a sheet of <b>tissue-paper</b> unfolded from it two or three undulating locks of raven hair, which fell over the paper like black streams. From these he selected one, wrapped it up, {{and gave it to}} the lad, whose eyes had filled with tears. He kissed the packet, put it in his pocket, and said in a voice of emotion, [...] "O, Mr. Clym, how good you are to me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{certainly}} will not, for I'm ashamed of myself when I remember what a romp that {{was and how}} sober Uncle looked as he let me in {{at three in the}} morning, all fagged out my dress in rags, my head aching, my feet so tired that I could hardly stand, and nothing to show for five hours' hard work but a pocketful of bonbons, artificial flowers, and <b>tissue-paper</b> fool's caps. Uncle said I'd better put one on and go to bed, for I looked as though I'd been to a French bal masque. I never want to hear him say so again, and I'll never let dawn catch me out in such a plight anymore." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{taken his}} dose of {{ready-made}} science (to use his own expression) {{the first thing}} in the morning on an empty stomach, Captain Wragge joined his small family circle at breakfast-time, inflated with information for the day. He observed that Magdalen's face showed plain signs of a sleepless night. She made no complaint: her manner was composed, and her temper perfectly under control. Mrs. Wragge--refreshed by some thirteen consecutive hours of uninterrupted repose--was in excellent spirits, and up at heel (for a wonder) with both shoes. She brought with her into the room several large sheets of <b>tissue-paper,</b> cut crisply into mysterious and many-varying forms, which immediately provoked from her husband the short and sharp question, [...] "What have you got there?" ...|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the evening}} was to be devoted to the German; and, as Polly knew nothing about it, she {{established}} herself in a window recess to watch the mysteries. For a time she enjoyed it, for it was all new to her, and the various pretty devices were very charming; but, by and by, that bitter weed, envy, cropped up again, and she could not feel happy to be left out in the cold, while the other girls were getting gay <b>tissue-paper</b> suits, droll bonbons, flowers, ribbons, and all manner of tasteful trifles in which girlish souls delight. Everyone was absorbed; Mr. Sydney was dancing; Tom and his friends were discussing base-ball on the stairs; and Maud's set had returned to the library to play.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "I {{never can}} look any {{one in the}} face again! To think of my doing such a thing when I've always prided myself on being so thoughtful, and remembering things so perfectly! And here I've been {{reproaching}} Edward and poor Willis the whole evening for not coming to that horrid musicale, and accusing them {{of all kinds of}} things, and all the time I knew I'd forgotten something and couldn't think what it was! Oh, dear! I shall simply never forgive myself! But it was all because I wanted him to look so nice in it, and I got it pressed while he was away, and I folded it up in the <b>tissue-paper</b> myself, and took the greatest care of it; and then to have it turn out the way it has!" ...|$|E
60|$|Those things I remember, {{but what}} I {{was reading the}} day before my writing life began I have forgotten. I have only a vague notion {{that it might have}} been one of Trollope's {{political}} novels. And I remember, too, the character of the day. It was an autumn day with an opaline atmosphere, a veiled, semi-opaque, lustrous day, with fiery points and flashes of red sunlight on the roofs and windows opposite, while the trees of the square, with all their leaves gone, were like the tracings of India ink on a sheet of <b>tissue-paper.</b> It was one of those London days that have the charm of mysterious amenity, of fascinating softness. The effect of opaline mist was often repeated at Bessborough Gardens on account of the nearness to the river.|$|E
6000|$|The Young Man: [...] "Oh, a dozen--two dozen; I don't know! I want very long, slender stems, and {{the flowers}} with loose open petals; none of those stout, tough-looking little buds. Here! This, and this, and all these; no, I don't want any of those at all." [...] He selects the {{different}} stems of roses, and while the florist gets a box, and prepares it with a lining of cotton and <b>tissue-paper,</b> he leans over and writes on a card. He pauses and puts up his pencil; then he takes it out again and covers the card with writing. He gives it to the florist. [...] "I wish that {{to go into the}} box where it will be found the first thing." [...] He turns away, and encounters the lady's eyes as she chances to look toward him. [...] "I beg your pardon! But"-- ...|$|E
60|$|On {{their return}} to the window, they saw that Grizel had {{finished}} her ca'ming and was now {{sitting on the floor}} nursing a doll. Tommy had not thought her the kind to shut her eyes to the truth about dolls, but she was hugging this one passionately. Without its clothes it was of the nine-pin formation, and the painted eyes and mouth had been incorporated long since in loving Grizel's system; but it became just sweet as she swaddled it in a long yellow frock and slipped its bullet head into a duck of a pink bonnet. These articles of attire and the others that you begin with had all been made by Grizel herself out of the colored <b>tissue-paper</b> that shopkeepers wrap round brandy bottles. The doll's name was Griselda, and it was exactly six months old, and Grizel had found it, two years ago, lying near the Coffin Brig, naked and almost dead.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a great}} pile {{of candles}} lying {{down on the floor}} near me, which a very old man in a rusty black gown with an {{open-work}} tippet, like a summer ornament for a fireplace in <b>tissue-paper,</b> made himself very busy in dispensing to all the ecclesiastics: one a-piece. They loitered about with these for some time, under their arms like walking-sticks, or in their hands like truncheons. At a certain period of the ceremony, however, each carried his candle up to the Pope, laid it across his two knees to be blessed, took it back again, and filed off. This was done in a very attenuated procession, as you may suppose, and occupied a long time. Not because it takes long to bless a candle through and through, but because there were so many candles to be blessed. At last they were all blessed: and then they were all lighted; and then the Pope was taken up, chair and all, and carried round the church.|$|E
60|$|As for the cross-eyed Q.C., he rose {{to reply}} with humorous confidence. Swaying his big body to and fro, he {{crumpled}} our will and our case in his fat fingers like so much flimsy <b>tissue-paper.</b> Mr. Ashurst had made a disposition of his property twenty years ago--the right disposition, the natural disposition; {{he had left the}} bulk of it as childless English gentlemen have ever been wont to leave their wealth--to the eldest son of the eldest son of his family. The Honourable Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst, the testator, was the scion of a great house, which recent agricultural changes, he regretted to say, had relatively impoverished; he had come to the succour of that great house, as such a scion should, with his property acquired by honest industry elsewhere. It was fitting and reasonable that Mr. Ashurst should wish to see the Kynaston peerage regain, in the person of the amiable and accomplished young nobleman whom he had the honour to represent, some portion of its ancient dignity and splendour.|$|E
6000|$|You cannot trust these employees. Mr. Wrenn {{was getting}} so absorbed {{in his work}} that he didn't even act {{as though it was}} a favor when Mr. Guilfogle allowed him to have his letters to the trade copied by carbon paper instead of having them blurred by the wet <b>tissue-paper</b> of a copy-book. The manager did grant the request, but he was justly indignant at the curt manner of the rascal, whereupon our bumptious revolutionist, our friend to anarchists and {{red-headed}} artists, demanded a [...] "raise" [...] and said that he didn't care a hang if the [qualified] letters never went out. The kindness of chiefs! For Mr. Guilfogle apologized and raised the madman's wage from seventeen dollars and fifty cents a week to his former nineteen dollars. [He had expected eighteen dollars; he had demanded twenty-two dollars and fifty cents; he was worth on the labor market from twenty-five to thirty dollars; while the profit to the Souvenir Company from his work was about sixty dollars minus whatever salary he got.] ...|$|E

60|$|Although I am {{satisfied}} that Wang's general performance {{was the first}} of that kind ever given on American soil, it has, probably, since become so familiar to many of my readers, that I shall not bore them with it here. He began by setting to flight, with the aid of his fan, the usual number of butterflies, made before our eyes of little bits of <b>tissue-paper,</b> and kept them in the air during the remainder of the performance. I have a vivid recollection of the judge trying to catch one that had lit on his knee, and of its evading him with the pertinacity of a living insect. And, even at this time, Wang, still plying his fan, was taking chickens out of hats, making oranges disappear, pulling endless yards of silk from his sleeve, apparently filling the whole area of the basement with goods that appeared mysteriously from the ground, from his own sleeves, from nowhere! He swallowed knives to the ruin of his digestion for years to come; he dislocated every limb of his body; he reclined in the air, apparently upon nothing. But his crowning performance, which I have never yet seen repeated, was the most weird, mysterious, and astounding. It is my apology for this long introduction, my sole excuse for writing this article, and the genesis of this veracious history.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{made a very}} showy-looking Hamlet, to say the least. He wore a pair {{of rubber}} boots many sizes too large for him, with tops that reached his knees, and were ornamented with <b>tissue-paper</b> rosettes; a black frock-coat, which on close {{inspection}} proved to be Johnny's best one, that he had worn when he called upon Mrs. Green, hung about his shoulders, covering his hands completely with its profusion of sleeves, and giving him a singular, if not distinguished appearance. This coat had been made more gorgeous than it originally was by having gilt paper pasted to each button, and a red sash tied about the waist, in which were two table-forks and a wooden sword, the latter article interfering sadly with his knees when he walked. On his head he wore a huge paper cap that had been painted red, white, and blue, and ornamented with a tuft of feathers that had once done service in a dusting-brush. He also had a gun, {{and the weight of}} it was about {{as much as he could}} stagger under when he tried to carry it over his shoulder, so he dragged it along behind him, very much as a person of Hamlet's melancholy temperament would have been likely to do. He also could sit down, which was no small comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "No true-hearted {{woman can}} find herself, in real, actual life, unskilled and unfit to {{minister}} to the wants and sorrows of those dearest to her, without a secret sense of degradation. The feeling of uselessness is an extremely unpleasant one. Tom Hood, in a very humorous paper, describes a most accomplished schoolmistress, a teacher of all {{the arts and crafts}} which are supposed to make up fine gentlewomen, who is stranded in a rude German inn, with her father writhing in the anguish of a severe attack of gastric inflammation. The helpless lady gazes on her suffering parent, longing to help him, and thinking over all her various little store of accomplishments, not one of which bears the remotest relation to the case. She could knit him a bead purse, or make him a guard-chain, or work him a footstool, or festoon him with cut <b>tissue-paper,</b> or sketch his likeness, or crust him over with alum crystals, or stick him over with little rosettes of red and white wafers; but none of these being applicable to his present case, she sits gazing in resigned imbecility, till finally she desperately resolves to improvise him some gruel, and, after a laborious turn in the kitchen,--after burning her dress and blacking her fingers,--succeeds only in bringing him a bowl of paste! ...|$|E
