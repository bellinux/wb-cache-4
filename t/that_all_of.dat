5|$|Born in Idaho, Bleak {{dropped out}} of school to become a combat medic, and was {{deployed}} to Korea with the 40th Infantry Division. During a mission north into Chinese territory, Bleak's patrol came under heavy attack by fortified Chinese positions. Despite being wounded himself, Bleak rushed the Chinese troops multiple times and killed five Chinese soldiers—four using only his hands—before assisting the wounded, and shielding another soldier from a grenade blast. Bleak is credited with saving the patrol's wounded and ensuring <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its members returned to allied lines. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Deprived of a {{rationale}} for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by Janet Reno.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E

At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found.
