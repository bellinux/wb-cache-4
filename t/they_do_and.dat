5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. <b>They</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E

The stages are fenestrated, from top to bottom, with a single lancet arched window, double lancet-arched windows, a diamond panel and louvered Gothic window.|$|E
25|$|Time {{independent}} {{solutions to}} field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking {{set out to}} show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> {{in just the right}} way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
25|$|Her main {{argument}} was that sex and domestic economics went hand in hand; {{for a woman}} to survive, she was reliant on her sexual assets to please her husband so that he would financially support his family. From childhood, young girls are forced into a social constraint that prepares them for motherhood by the toys that are marketed to them and the clothes designed for them. She argued {{that there should be no}} difference in the clothes that little girls and boys wear, the toys they play with, or the activities <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> described tomboys as perfect humans who ran around and used their bodies freely and healthily.|$|E

When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm sure people are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have always liked it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't think I could do what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> still be alive." ...|$|E

500|$|Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson), {{following}} an [...] "unfortunate encounter" [...] with the Fountain of Youth in 1892, is 170 {{years old and}} living in Toronto, Canada. Burton, now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a Museum of Natural History, is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes {{up with the idea}} of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America, Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero's doctor (Brenda Kamino), mother (Charlotte Boisjoli) and former airline colleague Mary (Dianne Heatherington), who is now with ACT UP, all refuse to demonize Zero, Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi's sarcoma. He presents this preliminary version to the press.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} {{helped push}} their romance into [...] "top gear". Kate {{went to the}} police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues. McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
500|$|The red-throated loon is a monogamous species {{which forms}} {{long-term}} pair bonds. Both sexes build the nest, {{which is a}} shallow scrape (or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers, and placed within a half-metre (18in) of {{the edge of a}} small pond. The female lays two eggs (though clutches of one and three have also been recorded); they are incubated for 24–29days, primarily by the female. The eggs, which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black, measure [...] and have a mass of , of which 8% is shell. Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid, so they hatch asynchronously. If a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding, for example) before the young hatch, the red-throated loon usually lays a second clutch, generally in a new nest. The young birds are precocial upon hatching: downy and mobile with open eyes. Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially, then small fish for 38–48days. Parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young. Ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> others the opposite.|$|E

500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent what they need to survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E
500|$|Votta {{criticized the}} show for the [...] "pointless adult love triangle" [...] {{involving}} Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins. VanDerWerff described Jones as [...] "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her [...] "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State". Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be about kids {{who are looking for}} approval and the various ways <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages. Chaney thought that Sue [...] "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that [...] "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly". This last point did not sit well with Berk, who wrote that the show resolved [...] "what was {{one of the more interesting}} subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have [...] "more with Burt". As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to [...] "leap through the television and explain to him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" [...] to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself [...] "sick" [...] of that plot thread, which he called [...] "just plain moronic".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E
