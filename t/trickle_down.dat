5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, {{the pace}} of {{structural}} reforms, including fiscal, monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislations, helped Egypt move towards a more market-oriented economy and prompted increased foreign investment. The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results which averaged 8% annually between 2004 and 2009 but the government largely failed to equitably share the wealth {{and the benefits of}} growth have failed to <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> to improve economic conditions for the broader population, especially with the growing problem of unemployment and underemployment. After the 2011 revolution Egypt's foreign exchange reserves fell from $36 billion in December 2010 to only $16.3 billion in January 2012, also in February 2012 Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered the Egypt's credit rating from B+ to B in the long term.|$|E
25|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the likelihood of}} a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work remains {{to be done in the}} region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.|$|E

The Waldorf's Oscar Tschirky recalled that Gates {{did not like the}} nickname, but did little to repudiate the claims as he would bet on practically everything. Oscar recalled a rainy afternoon in the Waldorf's Oak Room as Gates and two associates watched raindrops <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> the windows. Gates remarked that the drops did not move down the window at the same speed. [...] One of Gates' associates spotted two raindrops that were moving at the same rate and pointed them out to him. [...] Gates selected a raindrop and bet his associate that it would reach the bottom of the window first. [...] His associate took him up on the bet and before Gates' raindrop had won the race, the bets had changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands. Gates believed that all life was a gamble; a farmer gambled that he would have a successful harvest when planting crops, a merchant gambled that customers would buy items when ordering stock and a traveler gambled on arriving safely when setting out on a journey.|$|E

2500|$|According to International Monetary Fund economists, {{inequality}} in wealth and income is {{negatively correlated with}} the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also {{the quality of a}} country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, [...] "if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not <b>trickle</b> <b>down.</b> In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1st {{millennium}} BC, during the Zhou dynasty, members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different namespersonal names (míng 名), clan names (xìng 姓), lineage names (shì 氏), and [...] "style" [...] or [...] "courtesy" [...] names (zì 字)and up to two titles: standard titles (jué 爵), and posthumous titles (shì 諡 or shìhào 諡號). [...] Commoners possessed only a personal name (ming), and the modern concept of a [...] "surname" [...] or [...] "family name" [...] did not yet exist at any level of society.

2500|$|Top icing is the {{practice}} of placing a [...] to [...] layer of crushed ice on top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the cooling agent sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). Cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top iced just before shipment. Top icing added considerable dead weight to the load. Top-icing a [...] reefer required in excess of [...] of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that {{the water from the}} melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued.|$|E

2500|$|Bongo went on {{to preside}} over an oil boom that {{undoubtedly}} fueled an extravagant lifestyle {{for him and his}} family—dozens of luxurious properties in and around France, a US$800 million presidential palace in Gabon, fancy cars, etc. This enabled him to amass enough wealth {{to become one of the}} world's richest men. He carefully allowed just enough oil money to <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> to the general population of 1.4 million, thus avoiding mass unrest. He built some basic infrastructure in Libreville and, ignoring advice to establish a road network instead, constructed the US$4bn Trans-Gabon Railway line deep into the forested interior. Petrodollars funded the salaries of a bloated civil service, spreading enough of the state's wealth among the population to keep most of them fed and dressed. Gabon under Bongo was described in 2008 by the UK Guardian newspaper:Gabon produces some sugar, beer and bottled water. Despite the rich soil and tropical climate, there is only a tiny amount of agricultural production. Fruit and vegetables arrive on trucks from Cameroon. Milk is flown in from France. [...] And years of dependence on relatives with civil service jobs means that many Gabonese have no interest in seeking work outside the state sector – most manual jobs are taken by immigrants.|$|E
