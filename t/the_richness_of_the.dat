5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E
5|$|With its rhythmic {{arrangement}} of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, {{the exterior of}} Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which is an unusual feature as England's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16thcentury. <b>The</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th-century tracery is accentuated {{by the presence of}} ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.|$|E

5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E
5|$|There Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{had entered}} {{the service of a}} local Greek magnate against his rivals, and had gained the {{impression}} that the country was easy to take. When the magnate died, his son broke off the alliance with him, but Villehardouin, learning that the Crusaders under Boniface were besieging the Greek magnate Leo Sgouros in Nauplia and the Acrocorinth in the northwest, set out to seek his aid. Boniface sought to retain him in his own service, but Villehardouin teamed up with his fellow Champenois, Champlitte, whom he enticed with tales of <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land and with a pledge to recognize him as his lord. Boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking, and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers, Champlitte and Villehardouin set out together to conquer the Morea. The towns of Patras and Andravida fell without struggle, and at the latter Champlitte received the homage of the local magnates and people of the Skorta and Mesarea. From there the Franks moved south along the coast, accompanied by a fleet, easily taking the fortress of Pontikon, which they repaired and garrisoned. They bypassed the strong fortress of Arkadia (Kyparissia), and passing through Navarino, arrived at Modon. They repaired the fortress walls, long ago torn down by the Venetians to stop its use as a pirate base, and assaulted the nearby fort of Coron, which fell after a single day, and the town of Kalamata, which surrendered.|$|E

25|$|The name Clonmel {{is derived}} from the anglicisation of the Irish name Cluain Meala meaning honey meadow or honey vale.

25|$|Later in 216 AD, a small amphitheater for {{soldiers}} {{was built in}} the military area, while the new synagogue, completed in 244 AD, and a house of Christians were embellished with frescos of important characters wearing Roman tunics, caftans and Parthian trousers. These splendid paintings that cover the walls testify to <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish and Christian community. The population of Dura Europos, at the rate of 450-650 houses grouped to eight per island, is estimated at about 5000 people per maximum.|$|E
25|$|The Ghaznavid conquests were {{initially}} {{directed against the}} Ismaili Fatimids of Multan, who were engaged in an ongoing struggle with the Abbasid Caliphate in conjunction with their compatriots of the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa and the Middle East; Mahmud apparently hoped to curry the favor of the Abbasids in this fashion. However, once this aim was accomplished, he moved onto <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loot of wealthy temples and monasteries. By 1027, Mahmud had captured parts of North India and obtained formal recognition of Ghazni's sovereignty from the Abbassid Caliph, al-Qadir Billah.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the period}} from François I through Henri IV often is heavily {{inspired}} by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments {{commonly referred to as}} Mannerism, which is associated with Michelangelo and Parmigianino, among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} also {{is affected}} by the amount and <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, tempo, and rhythms used. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{contributed to}} the {{independence}} of the British Thirteen Colonies together with France. Despite France taking all the glory, the Spanish intervention in the American Revolution was decisive. The Spanish governor of Louisiana (New Spain) Bernardo de Gálvez carried out an anti-British policy due to the numerous British attacks to take control of <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Empire from more than a century ago. Spain and France were allies because of the Bourbon Pacte de Famille carried out by both countries against Britain. Bernardo de Gálvez took measures against British smuggling in the Caribbean sea and promoted trade with France. Under royal order from Charles III of Spain Gálvez continued the aid operations to supply the American rebels.|$|E
25|$|In 1827, Berlioz watched Irish actress Harriet Smithson at the Odéon theatre playing Ophelia and Juliet in Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. This led to two intense infatuations. One was to Smithson, {{which would}} result in a {{disastrous}} marriage. The other was to Shakespeare, which would become a lifelong love. He followed the rest of the 1827 season closely, until the company moved to the Salle Favart, and began learning the plays from pocket translations on sale. Though the performances were in English, of which Berlioz knew virtually none, he was still able to grasp the grandeur and sublimity of Shakespeare's language along with <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plays' dramatic design.|$|E

30|$|Global {{agreement}} was reached for all questions and recommendations, irrespective of divergences arising in interpretation and assessment of some studies. Evidence, in fact, showed overall homogeneity, and the clinical opinions from each member converged without affecting <b>the</b> <b>richness</b> <b>of</b> information. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> review are therefore coherent with current trends in clinical practice, although they do supply robust scientific data to support <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> graft in ACL primary surgery.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLACS sample <b>of</b> gravitational lenses. <b>The</b> {{local and global}} environments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lenses are characterized using SDSS photometry and, when available, spectroscopy. We find that the lens systems that are best modelled with steeper than isothermal density profiles {{are more likely to}} have close companions than lenses with shallower than isothermal profiles. This suggests that the profile steepening may be caused by interactions with a companion galaxy as indicated by N-body simulations <b>of</b> group galaxies. <b>The</b> global environments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLACS lenses are typical of non-lensing SDSS galaxies with comparable properties to <b>the</b> lenses, and <b>the</b> <b>richnesses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens groups are not as strongly correlated with the lens density profiles as the local environments. Furthermore, we investigate <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> line-of-sight contamination affecting the lens models but do not find a significant over-density of sources compared to lines of sight without lenses.
