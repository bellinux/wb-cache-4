The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it <b>to</b> be cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> be cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent.

Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies.
