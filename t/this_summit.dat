5|$|The 2006 Riga summit or the 19th NATO Summit was a NATO summit {{held in the}} Olympic Sports Centre, Riga, Latvia from 28 to 29 November 2006. The most {{important}} topics discussed were the War in Afghanistan and the future role and borders of the alliance. Further, the summit focused on the alliance's continued transformation, taking stock {{of what has been}} accomplished since the 2002 Prague Summit. NATO also committed itself to extend further membership invitations in the upcoming 2008 Bucharest Summit. <b>This</b> <b>summit</b> was the first NATO summit held on territory of a former USSR republic.|$|E
25|$|The Summit is also of {{significance}} considering that Muslims constitute {{a quarter of}} the world population and their countries possess abundant natural resources, although many Islamic countries still suffer poverty and diseases. It is therefore imperative to address these challenges using available resources, especially as <b>this</b> <b>Summit</b> is only the starting point for finding solutions to the countless problems facing the Muslim world using science and technology.|$|E
25|$|On December 30 Nigerian President {{and then}} African Union {{chairman}} Olusegun Obasanjo suggested a five-way, one-day summit grouping {{the leaders of}} Egypt, Libya, Chad, Sudan and Nigeria to solve the conflict and Egypt proposed the location and date of the summit as Tripoli on January 4, 2006, but <b>this</b> <b>summit</b> has been postponed.

25|$|The Group of Six (G6) was an {{unofficial}} forum which brought together {{the heads of}} the richest industrialized countries: France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. <b>This</b> <b>summit,</b> and the others which would follow, were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a kind of frustrated rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was an element in the genesis of cooperation between France's President and West Germany's Chancellor as they conceived the first summit of the G6.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before <b>this</b> <b>summit,</b> the Commission {{moved into}} the Breydel building. This was due to {{asbestos}} being discovered in the Berlaymont, forcing its evacuation in 1989. The Commission threatened {{to move out of}} the city, which would have destroyed Brussels's chances of hosting the Parliament, so the government stepped in to build the Breydel building a short distance from the Berlaymont in 23 months, ensuring the Commission could move in before the Edinburgh summit. Shortly after Edinburgh, Parliament bought its new building in Brussels. With the status of Brussels now clear, NGOs, lobbyists, advisory bodies and regional offices started basing themselves in the quarter near the institutions.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} was on August 23, 1994, when Syria officially linked the water {{issue to the}} PKK in the summit between Turkey, Syria and Iran. During <b>this</b> <b>summit</b> another interesting {{development was}} the Hatay issue, which was brought to table. While the summit was going at Damascus, the PKK was building its structure in Hatay; in July 1995, it performed its first activity there, later using this province as a base to extend its activities to Adana and Mersin; the PKK was extending to the East Mediterranean. This region {{was one of the}} centers of immigration from the southeast, and also is a temporary summer work area for the southeast region. For Turkey the region was sensitive, not because of the Kurds, but because of the Arab population. Beginning late 1995, Syrian backing of PKK operations at Hatay was perceived by Turkish governments as an active hostile threat from Syria more than the PKK. The PKK's Hatay operations ended with the undeclared war with Syria.|$|E

25|$|European leaders {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} alleged mistreatment of Tymoshenko. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding boycotted the Euro 2012 football tournament held in Ukraine and Poland. French public figures have appealed to FIFA, the world football authority, to cancel Euro 2012. Germany has announced that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit would depend on Tymoshenko fate. Ukraine compared the threats of a football boycott by European powers as a return to Cold War tactics. The German President, Joachim Gauck canceled a visit to Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities confirmed that the presidents of Austria, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia would no longer attend a summit {{to be held in}} Ukraine on 11 to 12 May 2012 (on 8 May 2012 Ukraine postponed <b>this</b> <b>summit).</b> Meanwhile, Switzerland offered to mediate between Ukraine and the European Union to resolve the issue on neutral grounds. Tymoshenko ended her hunger strike and was transferred to a hospital near Kharkiv on 9 May 2012, accompanied by German neurologist Lutz Harms of the Charité clinic Berlin.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, under Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine sent an {{official}} letter of application a Membership Action Plan (MAP), {{the first step}} in joining NATO. These leaders however guaranteed their opposition that membership in any military alliance would not pass without public approval in a referendum. This idea had gained support from a number of NATO leaders, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe. Russian leaders like Prime Minister and President-Elect Dmitry Medvedev made clear their opposition to Ukraine membership, and leading up to the April 2008 Bucharest summit their emissary actively lobbied against a Ukrainian MAP. After some debate among members at the summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Ukraine, together with Georgia, would someday join NATO, but neither would begin Membership Action Plans. At <b>this</b> <b>summit,</b> Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his last international speech before switching jobs with Medvedev, listed his grievances with NATO, and called Ukrainian membership [...] "a direct threat" [...] to his country.|$|E

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), their absence was interpreted to be [...] "a sign of dissatisfaction with the conclusions of <b>this</b> <b>summit,</b> which granted president Laurent Gbagbo the right to organise a referendum to seek adoption of the revision of article 35 of the Constitution on the conditions for eligibility for {{the presidency of the}} Republic".|$|E

It can be climbed from Gerlan, above Bethesda, taking the path following Afon Llafar then continuing to the summit of Yr Elen before following the short ridge to Carnedd Llewelyn. Another path starts from Helyg on the A5, taking the track to the reservoir then following the slopes above Craig yr Ysfa to the summit. An alternative is to reach it by following the main ridge, either from Pen yr Ole Wen or from Foel-fras.|$|E

2500|$|The {{headwaters}} of Eskdale and the Duddon {{are separated by}} a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15miles, finally meeting the sea {{on the slopes of}} Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott, Harter Fell and Green Crag. Alfred Wainwright considered the remainder of the range unworthy of inclusion in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, stating that [...] "south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. <b>This</b> <b>summit</b> has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country." [...] Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow, Black Combe and the low hills around Devoke Water to their hill lists. Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.|$|E
2500|$|In a communiqué, G-7 ministers {{committed}} to acting jointly to support world growth and employment {{and strengthen the}} financial sector, while avoiding protectionism.

2500|$|German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said [...] "Bretton Woods II" [...] {{should bring}} about [...] "genuine, all-encompassing {{reform of the}} {{international}} financial system". The Council of the European Union sees the meeting as [...] "tak early decisions on transparency, global standards of regulation, cross-border supervision and crisis management, to avoid conflicts of interest and to create an early warning system, so as to engender confidence among savers and investors in every country." [...] In announcing the meeting, the spokesperson for US President George Bush said that [...] "leaders will review progress being made to address the current financial crisis, advance a common understanding of its causes, and, {{in order to avoid}} a repetition, agree on a common set of principles for reform of the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world's financial sector". UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in a mid-October speech, set out several principles. These include transparency (internationally agreed accounting standards, credit insurance market standards), integrity (credit agencies, executive pay), responsibility (board member competency and expertise), sound banking practice (protecting against speculative bubbles). While addressing the G20 leaders, Chinese President Hu Jintao listed four priorities in reforming the international financial system: stepping up international cooperation in financial regulation; advancing reform of international financial institutions; encouraging regional financial cooperation; and improving the international currency system. Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the agreement was [...] "comprehensive, positive and balanced". Prior to <b>this</b> <b>summit,</b> Japan's Prime Minister, Taro Aso, had contributed feasible action plan based on the analysis of the surplus of Japan's international balance of payments in spite of her prolonged economic slump to Wall Street Journal, and also provided his idea includes funding in the meeting.
