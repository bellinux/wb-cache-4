6000|$|In the retrospect {{each of us}} {{seems to}} have been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> outlook almost continually. Each of us, you see, was full of the same question, very near and {{altogether}} predominant to us, the question: [...] "What am I going to do with my life?" [...] He saw it almost as importantly as I, but from a different angle, because his choice was largely made and mine still hung in the balance.|$|E

60|$|I {{do not ask}} you to tell me. I am {{not going}} to tell you what is in my heart; and I do not ask you to tell me what is in yours.

6000|$|... "You may think," [...] said she, [...] "that, {{knowing what}} I did, {{it was very}} queer {{for me to come}} out to you this morning, but I could not help it. You were getting dreadfully careless, and were staying so late and doing things which people would have been bound to notice, {{especially}} as father is always <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> enjoying the fresh hours of the morning, that I felt I could not let you go on any longer. And when it came to that fan business I saw plainly that you must either immediately start for Europe or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|On that afternoon, {{immediately}} on the husband's {{return to the}} house, his wife spoke to him as her father had desired. On that evening Mr. Wharton was dining at his club, and therefore there was the whole evening before them; but the thing to be done was disagreeable, and therefore she did it at once,--rushing into the matter almost before he had seated himself in the arm-chair which he had appropriated to his use in the drawing-room. [...] "Papa was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> affairs after you left this morning, and he thinks {{that it would be}} so much better if you would tell him all about them." ...|$|E

60|$|The men {{had already}} dismounted, and, having watered their horses, were eating their suppers. For my own part I {{went into the}} sitting-room of the inn with the Abbot and the Bart, that we might <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> plans.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning her father, Shabazz told an interviewer, [...] "My {{mother always}} <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> father, her husband, but ... she didn't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{these things that}} defined my father as the icon." [...] To learn about her father, Shabazz read his {{autobiography}} as a college student, and enrolled in a class to learn more.|$|R
60|$|We sat there, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> {{pleasant}} old Canterbury days, {{an hour or}} two. Mr. Wickfield, left to Agnes, {{soon became}} more like his former self; {{though there was a}} settled depression upon him, which he never shook off. For all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he remembered very well. He said it was like those times, to be alone with Agnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed. I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes, and in the very touch of her hand upon his arm, that did wonders for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think they}} are beautiful, very beautiful," [...] she said; [...] "but you can't sell them, can you? You see what I mean," [...] she said, almost pleaded. [...] "This writing of yours is not practical. Something is the matter--maybe {{it is with the}} market--that {{prevents}} you from earning a living by it. And please, dear, don't misunderstand me. I am flattered, and made proud, and all that--I could not be a true woman were it otherwise--that you should write these poems to me. But they do not make our marriage possible. Don't you see, Martin? Don't think me mercenary. It is love, the thought of our future, with which I am burdened. A whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day is no nearer. Don't think me immodest in thus <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake. Why don't you try to get work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing? Why not become a reporter?--for a while, at least?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom Goldsmith {{and myself}} now put our heads {{together}} {{as to what}} was best to be done. We were both afraid of falling into the enemy's hands, for, they might have bore up in the squall, and run down near us. On the whole, however, we thought the distance between the two squadrons was too great for this; at all events, something must be done at once. So we began to row, in what direction even we did not know. It still rained as hard as it could pour, though there was not a breath of wind. The lightning came now at considerable intervals, and the gust was evidently passing away towards the broader parts of the lake. While we were rowing and <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> chance of falling in with the enemy, Tom cried out to me to [...] "avast-pulling." [...] He had seen a vessel, by a flash, and he thought she was English, from her size. As he said she was a schooner, however, I thought it must be one of our own craft, and got her direction from him. At the next flash I saw her, and felt satisfied she belonged to us. Before we began to pull, however, we were hailed [...] "boat ahoy!" [...] I answered. [...] "If you pull another stroke, I'll fire into you"--came back--"what boat's that? Lay on your oars, or I'll fire into you." [...] It was clear we were mistaken ourselves for an enemy, and I called out to know what schooner it was. No answer was given, though the threat to fire was repeated, if we pulled another stroke. I now turned to Tom and said, [...] "I know that voice--that is old Trant." [...] Tom thought [...] "we were in the wrong shop." [...] I now sung out, [...] "This is the Scourge's boat--our schooner has gone down, and we want to come alongside." [...] A voice next called from the schooner--"Is that you, Ned?" [...] This I knew was my old shipmate and school-fellow, Jack Mallet, who was acting as boatswain of the Julia, the schooner commanded by sailing-master James Trant, one of the oddities of the service, and a man with whom the blow often came as soon as the word. I had known Mr. Trant's voice, and felt more afraid he would fire into us, than I had done of anything which had occurred that fearful night. Mr. Trant, himself now called out--"Oh-ho; give way, boys, and come alongside." [...] This we did, and a very few strokes took us up to the Julia, where we were received with the utmost kindness. The men were passed out of the boat, while I gave Mr. Trant an account of all that had happened. This took but a minute or two.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the maiden}} article of his Philippine Daily Inquirer column, he {{proposed}} [...] "A middle {{way of looking}} at Filipino culture, avoiding one extreme of protracted Lenten self-flagellation that could see nothing good in the Filipino, but also being mature enough to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> faults." ...|$|R

"But it is {{essential}} to remember that in the final analysis - and all talk about global functions of the various sorts to the contrary notwithstanding - there are no such things as global functions: and when we speak of such functions we are ultimately <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> own notational conventions for referring to sets." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Greens {{state that}} their vlog has no {{consistent}} format: [...] "Really, it's not about anything in particular.

40|$|In this paper, we will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> {{experiences}} with implementing a {{first set of}} tools for our software maintenance project, called AEMES 2 which is currently being developed at the Institut fur Informatik of the University of Zurich, using the functional programming language Standard ML. We will first <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> some experiences we made with this fairly new programming language {{and then go on}} to sketch the ideas that are behind our implementation of a functional COBOL parser/recognizer. We will further elaborate on why we had to introduce gross-grain scanning when dealing with COBOL programs and then <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> cross referencer. The paper closes with conclusions and an outlook on our future work. 1 INTRODUCTION Functional programming languages are well established today and the advantages of the functional programming approach are also widely known.
