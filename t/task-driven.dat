50|$|Within {{modelling}} and simulation, a {{model is}} a <b>task-driven,</b> purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints. It is <b>task-driven,</b> because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail {{as the object of}} interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a model in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the propertied concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and {{is often referred to as}} a Conceptual model. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a Computer simulation. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics. Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.|$|E

40|$|Sparse {{representation}} models {{a signal}} as a linear {{combination of a}} small number of dictionary atoms. As a generative model, it requires the dictionary to be highly redundant in order to ensure both a stable high sparsity level and a low reconstruction error for the signal. However, in practice, this requirement is usually impaired by the lack of labelled training samples. Fortunately, previous research has shown that the requirement for a redundant dictionary can be less rigorous if simultaneous sparse approximation is employed, which can be carried out by enforcing various structured sparsity constraints on the sparse codes of the neighboring pixels. In addition, numerous works have shown that applying a variety of dictionary learning methods for the sparse representation model can also improve the classification performance. In this paper, we highlight the <b>task-driven</b> dictionary learning algorithm, which is a general framework for the supervised dictionary learning method. We propose to enforce structured sparsity priors on the <b>task-driven</b> dictionary learning method in order to improve the performance of the hyperspectral classification. Our approach is able to benefit from both the advantages of the simultaneous sparse representation and those of the supervised dictionary learning. We enforce two different structured sparsity priors, the joint and Laplacian sparsity, on the <b>task-driven</b> dictionary learning method and provide the details of the corresponding optimization algorithms. Experiments on numerous popular hyperspectral images demonstrate that the classification performance of our approach is superior to sparse representation classifier with structured priors or the <b>task-driven</b> dictionary learning method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Dictionary {{learning}} algorithms {{have been}} success-fully used for both reconstructive and discriminative tasks, where an input signal is represented with a sparse linear combination of dictionary atoms. While these methods are mostly developed for single-modality scenarios, {{recent studies have}} demonstrated the advantages of feature-level fusion based on the joint sparse representation of the multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose a multimodal <b>task-driven</b> dictionary learning algorithm under the joint sparsity constraint (prior) to enforce collaborations among multiple homogeneous/heterogeneous sources of information. In this <b>task-driven</b> formulation, the multimodal dictionaries are learned simultaneously with their corresponding classifiers. The resulting multimodal dictionaries can generate discriminative latent features (sparse codes) from the data that are optimized for a given task such as binary or multiclass classification. Moreover, we present {{an extension of the}} proposed formulation using a mixed joint and independent sparsity prior, which facilitates more flexible fusion of the modalities at feature level. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms for multimodal classification is illustrated on four different applications—multimodal face recognition, multi-view face recognition, multi-view action recognition, and multimodal biometric recognition. It is also shown that, compared with the counterpart reconstructive-based dictionary learning algorithms, the <b>task-driven</b> formulations are more computation-ally efficient {{in the sense that they}} can be equipped with more compact dictionaries and still achieve superior performance.
