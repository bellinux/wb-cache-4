5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{developing}} nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine {{may be seen in}} southern Brazil. Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> medical residency training is also present.|$|E
5|$|Five {{thousand}} people were evacuated <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters as Winifred neared. With {{the approach of}} the hurricane, watches and warnings were issued.

5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
5|$|In Baja California Sur, 2,500residents were {{evacuated}} <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters. Officials closed the port at Mazatlán and recommended fisherman {{along the coast}} of the Gulf of California to remain at port. Officials set up 49shelters on the mainland to provide evacuees with food, clothing and medical attention. The Mexican Army assisted residents in evacuation, and the Navy provided medical aid and assistance to boat owners. More than 24,000people were sheltered during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In Veracruz, 124people {{were killed}} in the event, {{including}} three in a rescue helicopter crash. About 23,500people statewide had to evacuate <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters in 452communities. The governor declared the state as a disaster zone after 13rivers exceeded their banks, and two entire villages were washed away. A total of 75,135people were injured in Veracruz, about one third of whom became homeless due to the floods. In rural areas, 77,123people lost power. Statewide, 11bridges were damaged, and 22portions along the Poza Rica-Veracruz highway was damaged. In Zaragoza, the floods destroyed 91% of the year's crops.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters, but residents only occupied 47 {{of them before}} the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E
5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E

5|$|The board noted that: {{the test}} {{planners}} {{had failed to}} identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> response such as steps, sliding doors, and sharp turns.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded <b>to</b> <b>Emergency</b> Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{people in}} Guam evacuated <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters {{in advance of}} Typhoon Tingting. Several schools throughout Guam were being used as shelters. A tropical storm warning and a flash flood warning, which were issued several hours before the typhoon warning, were kept in place for Guam until June29. A small craft advisory was also issued for rest of the Mariana Islands. A typhoon warning was declared {{for most of the}} islands on June27. The United States Air Force Base in the Mariana Islands was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Four, the lowest level of readiness, as Tingting approached.|$|E
5|$|As Gert {{was several}} {{days away from}} Bermuda, the NHC advised {{residents}} there to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm, Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the size and strength of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September19, about two days prior to its closest approach. As Gert moved closer to the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September20, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away. Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters. Police workers advised 700families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships away, while hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas. By 12weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2million (2003USD, ($ USD)).|$|E

5|$|Due to Lane's {{projected}} path {{near the}} western coast of Mexico, authorities closed ports to small {{boats in the}} cities of Acapulco. Just weeks after Hurricane John took a similar path through the area, several tourists voluntarily left their vacations to fly home. Many residents boarded up buildings and bought hurricane supplies {{in preparation for the}} storm. Officials also closed schools across the state of Guerrero. In all, 40,400tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline. According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican Civil Protection Service operates, there were 5.5million homes and 21million people in 21states threatened by the system in all of Mexico. As a result, authorities evacuated about 2,000people <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm. Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico. Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, Mexico. Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster. At least 1,400people were evacuated in Chiapas <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> shelters.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened <b>to</b> <b>emergency</b> diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E
