5|$|Hurricane Winifred was {{the last}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> 1992 Pacific hurricane season.

5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ella was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} on record in Canadian waters. It formed on August30, 1978 {{to the south of}} Bermuda, and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. By September1, Ella reached winds of 125mph (205km/h), and it was expected to pass close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> Labor Day Weekend. The hurricane became stationary for about 24hours, and later turned to the northeast away from the coast. On September4, Ella reached Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale off the coast of Nova Scotia. It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger business {{on the line to}} <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) to take charge of railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> preceding season, this season had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there}} was a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal. However, the number of days with a tropical cyclone was slightly above normal at 15. In general, the southern hemisphere as a whole had the least active season since 1954. There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage was much less than the preceding year.|$|E
