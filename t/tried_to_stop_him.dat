5|$|Pattle {{had flown}} several patrols {{that morning and}} was {{suffering}} from a high temperature and fever. He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under the blankets. He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran for the door towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him,</b> but Pattle was determined to fly. On {{the way to his}} fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the {{committee}} began work, a CD was released that appeared to be a recording of conversation between Shanti Bhushan and Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party. The recording, related to 2G spectrum scam, would discredit Shanti Bhushan, if found to be genuine. Prashant Bhushan stated that labs had shown the CD was doctored, and that its purpose was to obstruct the anti-corruption movement. Later, Singh claimed that Bhushan telephoned him and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> from talking, a charge which Bhushan denied.|$|E

Both men took control during the match. Vickie Guerrero interrupted the match and tried to stop both men from fighting. She pulled Chavo {{out of the ring}} and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him,</b> but he kept on fighting. Vickie then tried to plead with Mysterio but accidentally shoved him off the ropes. Chavo took advantage by performing a frog splash on Mysterio for the victory.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May 1880 a {{case was}} heard before the Nottingham Magistrates' Court where James Crabbe a tram driver {{was charged with}} {{offences}} from 4 May of using abusive language {{to the police and}} with running his tramcar into the Yeomanry. The officer reported that his was on duty at the junction of Clumber Street and Parliament Street when the defendant came along driving his tram, and persisted in pushing his way into the Cavalry.

The officer reported that the defendant used bad language and told the officer to go somewhere. James Crabbe was found guilty and the bench imposed a fine of 40s.|$|E
25|$|During these events, Ezio {{uses the}} keys in his {{possession}} to witness Altaïr's life after the events depicted in the first game. After killing Al-Mualim, Altaïr took possession of the Apple of Eden and assumed leadership of the Assassins. One of the Assassins, Abbas, did not support Altaïr due to past events, and for killing Al Mualim. When Altaïr and his wife Maria left Masyaf for 10 years to repel the Mongol invasion, Abbas staged a coup d'etat, seizing control of the Assassins and executing Altaïr's youngest son Sef. Altaïr sought revenge; but as Maria <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him,</b> another Assassin stabbed Maria in the back. Altaïr was forced to flee with his elder son, Darim, and went into self-imposed exile for 20 years. Altaïr finally returned to Masyaf, killed Abbas, then took his rightful place as the Assassins' leader. In the process, Altaïr told the dying Abbas {{the truth of the}} latter's father's death. Years later, an aged Altaïr encodes his memories on the five keys Ezio would find, entrusting them to Niccoló.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event cage match wrestlers could escape the cage and thus unmasking only by {{climbing}} {{over the top of}} the cage and all the way to the floor. The first escapee was Coco Armarillo who climbed over the top within minutes of the opening bell. When Máscara Sagrada Jr. tried to escape the Killer, the real one this time, climbed up the cage from the outside and pushed Máscara Sagrada Jr. off the top of the cage, back inside the ring. A few minutes later Coco Azul was able to leave the cage as well, leaving his two partners at a four-on-two disadvantage in the cage. During the match Máscara Sagrada tried to even the sides as he tried to prevent the Killer from interfering on several occasions. When Tinieblas Jr. climbed the cage the Killer <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> as he had done before, but this time Tinieblas Jr. was able to knock Killer down and become the third man to leave the cage, moments later Máscara Sagrada Jr. also left the cage. At this point Lady Victoria, who was siding with Los Payasos and Karis locked Miss Janeth to the cage with a pair of handcuffs. Blue Demon Jr. managed to kick a chair into the face of Karis La Momia and then use the break in the action to climb {{over the top of the}} cage to the floor. When the match came down to Karis La Momia and Halcón Dorado Jr. Máscarita Sagráda Jr. ran to ringside to help his regular-sized friends out, helping unlock the handcuffs used on Miss Janeth. Looking to help out the diminutive Mini-Estrella climbed up the outside of the cage and dove off the top. He intended to hit Karis La Momia, but at the last moment Karis moved and Máscarita Sagráda Jr. landed on Halcón Dorado Jr. instead. Karis use the opening to handcuff Máscarita Sagráda Jr. to Halcón Dorado Jr., then began to climb the cage, when Halcón Dorado Jr. <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> he was slowed down by the fact that he was dragging Máscarita Sagráda Jr. behind him, making him too late to stop Karis from leaving the cage. After the match a frustrated Halcón Dorado Jr. revealed that his real name was Antonio Olmos, then angrily pulled his mask off and attacked Máscarita Sagráda Jr. and Máscara Sagráda Jr. blaming them for his mask loss.|$|E

25|$|Batista {{returned}} on the April 6, 2009, {{episode of}} Raw, to save Triple H, Shane McMahon, and Vince McMahon from The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr.). Vince McMahon then announced that Batista {{would take his}} place at Backlash, where he would team up with WWE Champion Triple H and Shane McMahon to face The Legacy. During the match, Batista had brought out a chair, but Triple H <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him,</b> so they would not get disqualified. This distraction however, cost Triple H his championship, after he lost it to Orton. The following night on Raw, Batista won a singles match against Big Show due to a distraction by John Cena, to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Judgment Day. Batista went on to defeat Orton in a rematch at Extreme Rules in a Steel Cage match to capture the WWE Championship. However, on June 8 episode of Raw, Batista was to vacate the title due to a staged brutal attack by Orton and the Legacy. It was later revealed that Batista had suffered a legitimate torn left biceps similar to what he suffered in 2006. Legacy was given on-screen credit for his injury.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
2500|$|Mangal {{was spotted}} by then Afghanistan coach Taj Malik. Mangal’s father <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> playing, citing the sport {{as not being}} a living.

Mangal made his debut for Afghanistan against Nowshehra in the 2001 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Grade II). He made his international debut for Afghanistan against Oman in the 2004 ACC Trophy. During the tournament, Mangal was Afghanistan's leading run scorer with 271 runs. It {{was the first time}} the team participated in the competition and they progressed to the quarter-finals where they lost to Kuwait.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his injury, Liu Zan {{remained}} headstrong and unyielding. He {{was particularly}} fond of reading military and history books. Whenever he read about how military commanders {{in ancient times}} deployed their troops in battle, he would sigh because he thought that he could never be like them. He once told his family and friends, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos, with so many people fighting for power. Throughout history, only extraordinary people will succeed in becoming rich and famous. Now that I can't do anything with this crippling injury, I am no different from being dead. I intend to cut my leg. If I am lucky enough to survive and be able to straighten my leg, then I'll be able to pursue my dreams. If I die, then so be it." [...] His family and friends <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> but to no avail. He cut himself in the leg and let blood flow freely, but became unconscious because of the pain.

2500|$|Michigan scored four {{additional}} {{touchdowns in}} the second half. [...] Reimenschneider fumbled the opening kickoff to start the second half, and Michigan recovered the ball at Case's 20-yard line. [...] After the turnover, Michigan quarterback Harry Workman ran for a touchdown. [...] Michigan's third touchdown {{was set up by}} a poor punt by Case from behind its own goal line. [...] A penalty was tacked on, and Michigan got the ball at the Case 10-yard line. [...] Workman again ran for the touchdown. [...] Clarence Schenk scored Michigan's fourth touchdown on a [...] "cross buck" [...] from the five-yard line. [...] The final touchdown was scored by Arthur [...] "Waukegan" [...] Wright, a substitute right tackle who was described as [...] "the 'pompadour' haired medic from Illinois," [...] on a 35-yard run following an on-side kick. [...] A rule change enacted in 1906 allowed the punting team to recover a punt as a live ball. [...] The Detroit Free Press described Wright's touchdown as follows:"Garrels made an on-side punt to the Case thirty-five yard line. [...] Wright brought the ball to his breast after the bound as if it was his long-lost child, and was saving it from the kidnappers. [...] Three Case men <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> as he was making the run for his fireside home, but he seemed to have a through ticket without a [...] punch, and scored the first touchdown of the year on the new rules." ...|$|E
