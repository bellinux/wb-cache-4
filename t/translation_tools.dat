2500|$|Meedan’s {{translation}} {{technology has been}} developed in collaboration with The Watson Research Group at IBM with which it entered into a research partnership in 2006. Development has focused on Machine and Machine Augmented <b>Translation</b> <b>tools</b> that enable users to improve translations collaboratively, including IBM’s Transbrowser – a browser tool for creating a translation layer on the web. Perhaps most significantly, Meedan is open licensing the linguistic data generated from its efforts. Improved translation automation and augmentation has profound implications in global media, education, and business and information services; [...] Meedan hopes to play a small part by leading an effort to steer the global computational linguistics community to embrace open licensing of linguistic corpora. [...] Meedan aims {{to contribute to the}} Arabic English linguistic corpus, and therefore improve MT quality, by providing translation services to individuals and partner organizations. Meedan is especially interested in advancing progress in the under served direction of source English to target Arabic Machine Translation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> that automatically generates efficient target programming language code (C, C++, Java and C#) from Event-B formal specification {{related to the}} analysis of complex problems. This tool is a collection of plug-ins, which are used for translating Event-B formal specifications into different kinds of programming languages. The <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> is rigorously developed with safety properties preservation. The results detailed in this paper are an architecture of the translation process, to generate a target language code from Event-B models using Event-B grammar through syntax-directed translation, code scheduling architecture and verification of an automatic generated code. The translator checks syntax and type consistency before generating the target programming language code. The <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> has been developed as a set of Rodin plug-ins under the Eclipse development framework. An assessment of the proposed approach is given through a case study, relative {{to the development of a}} cardiac pacemaker system...|$|R
