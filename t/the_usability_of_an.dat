50|$|Component-based {{usability}} testing (CBUT) is {{a testing}} approach which aims at empirically testing <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction component. The latter {{is defined as}} an elementary unit of an interactive system, on which behaviour-based evaluation is possible. For this, a component needs to have an independent, and by the user perceivable and controllable state, such as a radio button, a slider or a whole word processor application. The CBUT approach {{can be regarded as}} part of component-based software engineering branch of software engineering.|$|E
5000|$|... 6. Usability testing:Usability {{testing is}} carried out to verify if the {{application}} is achieving its goals and getting a favorable response from users. This is important as <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> application is its key to commercial success (it is nothing but user friendliness). Another important part of usability testing {{is to make sure}} that the user experience is uniform across all devices. This section of testing hopes to address the key challenges of the variety of mobile devices and the diversity in mobile platforms/OS, which is also called device fragmentation. One key portion of this type of usability testing is to be sure that there are no major errors in the functionality, placement, or sizing of the user interface on different devices., ...|$|E

50|$|CBUT {{is based}} on both {{software}} architectural views such as model-view-controller (MVC), presentation-abstraction-control (PAC), ICON and CNUCE agent models that split up the software in parts, and cognitive psychology views where a person's mental process is split up in smaller mental processes. Both software architecture and cognitive architecture use the principle of hierarchical layering, in which low level processes are more elementary and for humans often more physical in nature, such as the coordination movement of muscle groups. Processes that operate on higher level layers are more abstract and focus on a person's main goal, such as writing an application letter to get a job. The layered protocol theory (LPT), which is a special version of perceptual control theory (PCT), brings these views together by suggesting that users interact with a system across several layers by sending messages. Users interact with components on high layers by sending messages, such as pressing keys, to components operating on lower layers, which on their turn relay a series of these messages into a single high level message, such as 'DELETE *.*', to a component on a higher layer. Components operating on higher layers, communicate back to the user by sending messages to components operating on lower level layers. Whereas this layered-interaction model explains how the interaction is established, control loops explain {{the purpose of the}} interaction. LPT sees the purpose of the users' behaviour as the users' attempt to control their perception, in this case the state of the component they perceive. This means that users will only act if they perceive the component to be in an undesirable state. For example, if a person have an empty glass but want a full glass of water, he or she will act (e.g. walk to the tap, turning the tap on to fill the glass). The action of filling the glass will continue until the person perceives the glass as full. As interaction with components takes places on several layers, interacting with a single device can include several control loops. The amount of effort put into operating a control loop is seen as an indicator for <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction component.|$|E

40|$|In this work, <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{randomized}} numeric keypad {{was examined}} and compared to <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conventional numeric keypad.

The {{results showed that the}} average completion time with a randomized keypad is longer than with a conventional keypad. Additionally, the number <b>of</b> errors with <b>a</b> randomized keypad was significantly higher than with a conventional keypad, particularly when using long PINs.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{a new approach}} of using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) modeling technique to improve the design of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) user interfaces. <b>The</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EMR medication dosage calculator used for placing orders in an academic hospital setting was investigated. The proposed method captures and analyzes the interactions between user interface elements of the EMR system and groups elements based on information exchange, spatial adjacency, and similarity to improve screen density and time-on-task. Medication dose adjustment task time was recorded for the existing and new designs using a cognitive simulation model that predicts user performance. We estimate that the design improvement could reduce time-on-task by saving an average of 21 hours of hospital physicians’ time {{over the course of}} a month.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our attempts at using the Cognitive Dimensions framework to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object oriented (OO) {{application programming interface}} (API). The Cognitive Dimensions framework was originally designed {{as a tool to}} evaluate and describe the usability of a programming language but to our knowledge, no reports of it being used to evaluate an API are publicly available. Since many popular OO languages come with an existing set of APIs in the form of OO class libraries, it is important to ensure that the APIs developers use are usable, just as it is to ensure that a programming language is usable also. Thus, in order to measure <b>the</b> <b>usability</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API, we have adapted the Cognitive Dimensions framework so that it better measures those aspects of an API that we feel have an impact on its usability. This paper describes these modifications and the reasons we chose to make them. In addition, using the framework in an industrial setting has presented some interesting challenges, and so we describe those challenges here and our attempts to address them. Keywords: POP-III.
