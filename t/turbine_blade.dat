40|$|The {{conventional}} {{means of}} improving {{gas turbine engine}} performance typically involves increasing the turbine inlet temperature; however, at these higher operational temperatures the high pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>blades</b> require air-cooling to maintain durability.

50|$|Variable Geometry Turbomachine {{technology}} {{is used in}} turbocharger of diesel engines, where the turbo has variable vanes which control the flow of exhaust onto the <b>turbine</b> <b>blades.</b> A Variable Geometry Turbocharger has movable vanes which direct the flow of exhaust onto the <b>turbine</b> <b>blades.</b> Actuators are used to adjust the vane angles. Agle of vanes vary hroughout the range of RPM to optimize turbine behaviour. At high engine speed vanes are fully open and the exhaust is fully directed onto the <b>turbine</b> <b>blades.</b> At low engine speeds vanes are almost closed creating a narrow passage for the exhaust. This accelerates the exhaust towards the <b>turbine</b> <b>blades,</b> making them spin faster.|$|R

25|$|Dilution air is airflow {{injected}} {{through holes}} in the liner {{at the end of}} the combustion chamber to help cool the air to before it reaches the turbine stages.

25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where {{one or two of}} the high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings.

25|$|The rate of {{deformation}} is {{a function}} of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied structural load. Depending on the magnitude of the applied stress and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves tensile stresses that might otherwise lead to cracking.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{reactive}} centrifugal is rarely used in analyses in the physics literature, {{the concept is}} applied within some mechanical engineering concepts. An example {{of this kind of}} engineering concept is an analysis of the stresses within a rapidly rotating <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> The blade can be treated as a stack of layers going from the axis out {{to the edge of the}} blade. Each layer exerts an outward (centrifugal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially inward layer and an inward (centripetal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially outward layer. At the same time the inner layer exerts an elastic centripetal force on the middle layer, while and the outer layer exerts an elastic centrifugal force, which results in an internal stress. It is the stresses in the blade and their causes that mainly interest mechanical engineers in this situation.|$|E

2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a <b>turbine</b> <b>blade,</b> commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E
