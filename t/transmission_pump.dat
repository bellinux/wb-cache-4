40|$|This project {{treats the}} {{analysis}} of the hydrostatic transmission dynamic properties using a simulation model, which has been done with the simulation program AMESim. That simulation has been the main work in the project, especially because it {{is a good way to}} understand how a hydrostatic transmission works. The hydrostatic transmission are used in heavy vehicles such as earth moving machines, agriculture machines, forest machines, industrial and mining lifters. Nowadays, the demand of that kind of transmissions is increasing because of hydraulic drives have many advantages over other technologies. That is because of hydrostatic transmission has a high output capacity combined with high overall efficiency over a wide velocity range, and all that, with a low weight and volume. So, the first step was to develop a simulation for a transmission used in heavy machinery. Thus, that model has a gearbox, high inertias and high torque corresponding to the wheels and the shafts of the vehicle. Also a simulation of a transmission located in a test stand has been done. Next to that, the efficiency has been improved in a wide used range. To do that, a control system for the <b>transmission</b> <b>pump</b> and motor has been implemented. With it, the controllability of the system is much better in different loading conditions. And also with all this information, the objective is to be able to choose the main transmission components (pump, motor and gearbox). The real transmission which is in a test stand in the Linköping University laboratories has been taken as a model to set the parameters of this simulation model. Another important thing has been the validation of the simulation model by comparing its results with the theoretical results, which has been calculated using the hydraulic equations.

40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} are a step towards more environmentally friendly way of transportation. This type of vehicles will {{play an important}} role in the foreseeable future to decrease the overall dependence on oil reserves but also to reduce the combustion engine's negative impact on e. g. pollution and noise in urban areas. Hybrid propulsion systems can be accomplished in several different ways, but the common idea is to add an electrical motor for additional tractive power. This also gives possibility to recuperate the kinetic energy which is otherwise lost when braking. The hybrid transmission under development uses pressurized oil for gear shifting operations, clutch activation and cooling. Conventional automatic transmissions usually have a hydraulic pump driven by the combustion engine for pressurizing the oil. In the hybrid transmission, oil pressure is necessary also when the combustion engine is not running. In this Master's Thesis a design proposal for an electric oil pump for the transmission are developed. The goal has been to design a pump concept able to operate in all possible driving modes for a hybrid vehicle. The concept was designed considering capacity and pressure requirements, winter temperature performance, efficiency and package space. Three different hydraulic pump concepts has been developed and analyzed. A current transmission oil pump has also been analyzed for reference purposes. The different concepts have been extensively evaluated by methods described by Pahl & Beitz [5]. The chosen concept is a single stage spur gear pump driven by an electric motor. The volume displaced at each revolution is 5 cm 3 and the output flow can be varied by altering the rotational speed of the electric machine. The output produced by the pump can by an intelligent control system be precisely matched to the flow demanded by the hydraulic system in the transmission. Compared to a conventional <b>transmission</b> <b>pump</b> where the output is constrained to the engine speed, less power is needed because of the demand oriented flow production. A reduction in driving power of up to 46 % for a highway cruise cycle can be achieved by incorporating the electro- hydraulic pump concept into a transmission. This corresponds to a total fuel saving of approximately 1. 8 %. The overall efficiency for the pump concept developed is 85 % under optimal operation conditions, for the reference pump, overall efficiency is 64 % under the same conditions. Packing size of the proposed design is strongly dependent on electric motor size since the motor is 5 times larger than the actual pump unit. This is due to the cold operation performance of the pump where low temperatures increase viscous friction dramatically and increases torque loss. If the cold operation performance was irrelevant and the motor could be designed for optimum operation conditions, the size of the motor could be reduced by 40 %. The complete package including pump and electric motor is however substantially larger than the reference pump design, even if designing for optimum operation conditions.

40|$|How {{an animal}} matches feeding to food {{availability}} {{is a key}} question for energy homeostasis. We addressed this in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which couples feeding {{to the presence of}} its food (bacteria) by regulating pharyngeal activity (pumping). We scored pumping in the presence of food and over an extended time course of food deprivation in wild-type and mutant worms to determine the neural substrates of adaptive behavior. Removal of food initially suppressed pumping but after 2 h this was accompanied by intermittent periods of high activity. We show pumping is fine-tuned by context-specific neural mechanisms and highlight a key role for inhibitory glutamatergic and excitatory cholinergic/peptidergic drives in the absence of food. Additionally, the synaptic protein UNC- 31 [calcium-activated protein for secretion (CAPS) ] acts through an inhibitory pathway not explained by previously identified contributions of UNC- 31 /CAPS to neuropeptide or glutamate <b>transmission.</b> <b>Pumping</b> was unaffected by laser ablation of connectivity between the pharyngeal and central nervous system indicating signals are either humoral or intrinsic to the enteric system.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of dispersive optical bistability {{in a system of}} cold atoms enclosed in a bidirectional ring cavity. This analysis is carried out using a system of equations which extend the so-called Maxwell-Bloch model to self-consistently include atomic centre-of-mass motion. When the atomic sample is sufficiently cold and dense, the atomic centre-of-mass motion causes the low <b>pump</b> <b>transmission</b> state to become unstable when the pump is blue-shifted with respect to the atomic resonance. This recoil-induced instability results in the exponential growth of the radiation field counterpropagating to the pump and an atomic density grating. The density grating strongly influences the dispersive properties of the atomic sample and causes the <b>pump</b> <b>transmission</b> to jump from the low transmission state to the high transmission state. It is expected that these effects should be observable in a cold (T K), dense (n similar to 10 (11) cm(- 3)) sample of Rb, enclosed in a high quality ring cavity (R approximate to 99 %).

These tests show that the piston with a matching valve indeed ensures a good matching of the system components over a wide range of solar insolations. Daily average solar panel maximum power point tracking efficiencies of over 80 % were measured. Daily average subsystem efficiencies (solar panel power output to hydraulic power output) measured were about 40 %, which is lower than expected.

30|$|During mud {{pulse signal}} <b>transmission,</b> mud <b>pumps</b> {{generate}} down-going mud flow which creates pressure signals by simultaneously {{opening and closing}} intake and exhaust valves and moving a piston back and forward within a cylinder. Reciprocating motion of mud pump pistons generates pump signals propagating downstream in opposite direction from the downhole pulse information carrying signal wave (Hahn et al. 2008). Forcing mud through the exhaust valve create mud pressure variations which pass through the surface transducer down the drill string to the drill bit and results into cumbersome mud pump noise signals (Reckmann 2014). Despite pressure random noise and signal interferences, generated mud pump pressure fluctuations create notable signal amplitude and frequency variations within the frequency ranges 1 – 20 Hz, commonly used for LWD data telemetry systems (Brackel 2016; Li and Reckmann 2009; Shen et al. 2013 a, b). The MPT pulse signal is lost in the pump noise which affects surface pressure transducers as are located close to mud pumps than to the mud pressure pulsar generators (Brackel 2016; Brooks 2015).

For non-interacting electrons, we give a quantitative account of the detailed exchange of electrons between the dot and the leads (to the electron reservoirs) during a pumping cycle. Near isolated distinct resonances, we use approximate Breit-Wigner expressions for the dot's Green function to discuss the loading/unloading picture of the pumping: the fractional charge exchanged between the dot and each lead through a single resonance point is related to the relative couplings of the dot and the leads at this resonance. If each resonance point along the pumping contour is dominated by the coupling to a single lead (which also implies a very small transmission), then the crossing of each such resonance results in a single electron exchange between the dot and that lead, ending up with a net quantized charge. When the resonance approximation is valid, the fractional charges can also be extracted from the peaks of the transmissions between the various leads. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
