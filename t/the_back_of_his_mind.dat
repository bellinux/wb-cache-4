500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> was trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2003 remastered {{version of the}} album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he {{constantly}} had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song [...] "What Goes On" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up Here to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.|$|E

Fichtner notes the erratic {{behavior}} of his character, commenting, [...] "The more twisted the better! Who wants to play a straight-away FBI guy?" [...] He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by [...] "some of the things that Mahone has {{in the back of his}} closet—and in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> the voices he is hearing about his own life."

500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott had {{accepted}} the job Demme had rejected, he said: [...] "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" [...] Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." [...] He also [...] "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a vampire movie." [...] He asked Harris if he was [...] "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.|$|E
500|$|Although {{this was}} his 12th {{published}} novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was [...] "20 years in the making". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run had been in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> for {{as long ago as}} 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the last sentence, {{said in an interview with}} The Independent in October 2009: [...] "For the longest time the last sentence eluded me, but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad." [...] Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing [...] "Tangled Up in Blue" [...] in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885 Lambert {{moved to}} Ohio City, Ohio, {{previously}} known as Enterprise, in Van Wert County. There {{he had an}} agricultural implement store, a grain elevator, and a lumber yard. Lambert also owned the town's opera house, town hall, jail and other town properties. Lambert always kept in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> the gas engine he saw in 1876.
