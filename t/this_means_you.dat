25|$|There is now (~2014) a retro {{movement}} {{which is}} {{resulting in a}} slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than {{the internet as a}} whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with ASCII text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.|$|E

60|$|Education means {{leading out}} the {{individual}} nature in each {{man and woman}} to its true fullness. You can't do that by stimulating the mind. To pump education into the mind is fatal. That which sublimates from the dynamic consciousness into the mental consciousness has alone any value. This, in most individuals, is very little indeed. So that most individuals, under a wise government, would be most carefully protected from all vicious attempts to inject extraneous ideas into them. Every extraneous idea, which has no inherent root in the dynamic consciousness, is as dangerous as a nail driven into a young tree. For the mass of people, knowledge must be symbolical, mythical, dynamic. <b>This</b> <b>means,</b> <b>you</b> must have a higher, responsible, conscious class: and then in varying degrees the lower classes, varying in their degree of consciousness. Symbols must be true from top to bottom. But {{the interpretation of the}} symbols must rest, degree after degree, in the higher, responsible, conscious classes.

60|$|By <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> {{may know}} how the Colours {{from the center of}} the Rings outward ought to succeed in order as they were {{described}} in the 4th and 18th Observations. For if you move the Ruler gradually from AH through all distances, having pass'd over the first Space which denotes little or no Reflexion to be made by thinnest Substances, it will first arrive at 1 the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green, which together with that violet compound blue, and then at the yellow and red, by whose farther addition that blue is converted into whiteness, which whiteness continues during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from I to 3, and after that by the successive deficience of its component Colours, turns first to compound yellow, and then to red, and last of all the red ceaseth at L. Then begin the Colours of the second Series, which succeed in order during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from 5 to O, and are more lively than before, because more expanded and severed. And for the same reason instead of the former white there intercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute and imperfect green. So the Colours of the third Series all succeed in order; first, the violet, which a little interferes with the red of the second order, and is thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blue and green, which are less mix'd with other Colours, and consequently more lively than before, especially the green: Then follows the yellow, some of which towards the green is distinct and good, but that part of it towards the succeeding red, as also that red is mix'd with the violet and blue of the fourth Series, whereby various degrees of red very much inclining to purple are compounded. This violet and blue, which should succeed this red, being mixed with, and hidden in it, there succeeds a green. And this at first is much inclined to blue, but soon becomes a good green, the only unmix'd and lively Colour in this fourth Series. For as it verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the Colours of the fifth Series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and red are very much diluted and made dirty, especially the yellow, which being the weaker Colour is scarce able to shew it self. After this the several Series interfere more and more, and their Colours become more and more intermix'd, till after three or four more revolutions (in which the red and blue predominate by turns) all sorts of Colours are in all places pretty equally blended, and compound an even whiteness.|$|E

Always treat the fathers of the Society with great mildness and respect; as well those who inhabit with you, as {{those who live in}} other places at a distance. Let not the least roughness, or haughty carriage, appear in you, if it be not when your moderation and humility are turned into contempt; for on such occasions, having nothing in your intentions but the good of your interiors, and not making the contempt of your authority the object of your vengeance, you are to make the guilty somewhat sensible of your power. But you shall only punish them so far as need requires, and for their amendment, and the edification of our brethren, who were witnesses of their fault. All the offences which shall be committed, either by the fathers or the brothers, against the rule of obedience, ought to be punished by some correction; and in so doing, the character of priesthood must be no privilege to the offender. If any of your inferiors act presumptuously against you, and, full of self-opinion, resist you with stubbornness, raise yourself in opposition to their pride, and speak magisterially to them. Let your behaviour towards them have more of severity than of mildness. Impose some public penance on them; and beware, of all things, that they may not observe in you the least remissness, which they will be sure to interpret fear; for nothing more encourages the untractable and haughty to rebellion, than the softness and fearful spirit of a governor. And it is not credible, how assuming, proud, and peremptory, they will grow, when once they find the reins are slackened, and that their pusillanimous superior is afraid of punishing their want of due respect. Impunity hardens that sort of people in their insolence; or rather, it makes them more and more audacious; which disturbs the peace of religious houses. Execute then my orders, without fearing the opinion or speech of people; and let no consideration, no regard of persons, hinder you from the performance of your duty. Amongst your inferiors, you will find some who are neither obstinate nor disobedient, but who are weak; who are forgetful of what is enjoined them, who indeed despise not the orders of their superiors, but sometimes neglect them, either out of faintheartedness, or want of sense. Reprehend such men with more gentleness and moderation, and temper your reproof with the mildness of your countenance; and if you find it necessary to punish them, impose but an easy penance on them. Never admit into the Society such as are not endued with judgment, and good natural parts; nor those who are of a weak constitution, and proper for no employment, or of whom you may reasonably suspect, that they would enter into religion for secular respects, rather than out of a sincere devotion of serving God. When they shall have ended their exercises, you are to employ them {{in the service of the}} sick in the public hospitals, and in the meanest offices of the house. You shall cause them to give you an account of the endeavours they have made, to acquit themselves well of their ordinary meditations, according to the form prescribed. If you are assured, that they are lukewarm and faint at their devotions, you will do well to dismiss them, and turn them out of the Society betimes; or if there be any hope of their amendment, you shall withdraw them for some days from those interior exercises; depriving them, by way of penance, of an honour which their negligence has made them unworthy to enjoy; and such indeed is that of communicating with God in prayer, to the end, that, being ashamed to stand excluded from that celestial commerce, they may desire more ardently to be re-admitted to it. I recommend extremely to you, that you pay an extraordinary respect to my lord the bishop; and that you be obedient to him. Beware of doing any thing which may displease him; endeavour, on the contrary, to serve him in all things according to your power; and acknowledge, by all manner of good offices, those infinite obligations which we have to so charitable a father and benefactor. Command those fathers who are out of Goa, to write to him from time to time, but not too prolixly; and to give him an account of the fruit of their labours. That they mention in their letters, as far as truth will give them leave, the commendation of his vicars; and omit not the other good actions of the religious; and if they can say no good of them, let them be silent of them; for we are not to imagine that our duty obliges us to complain to the bishop, of the ill conduct of his vicars, or of other gospel-labourers; there will never be wanting those who will ease us of that trouble. Beware, not to trouble yourself with the management of worldly business; nor even to encumber your inferiors with it, on any occasion whatsoever. When secular men shall desire to engage you in the employments of civil life, return this answer, 'That the time which remains free to you from preaching, and the administration of the sacraments, is scarce sufficient for your studies and devotions, which are yet necessary to you before you go into the pulpit, or appear in the tribune of penance; that you cannot prefer the care of worldly things, before the cure of souls, without perverting the order and rule of charity.' By <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>you</b> shall disengage yourself from all those sorts of encumbrances; and without this circumspection, you will do great prejudice to the Society; for you ought to understand, that the world often enters by this door into religious houses, to the extreme damage both of the religious, and of religion.|$|E
