5|$|Perhaps Simpson's {{most ambitious}} project was the laying of a {{submarine}} cable between Cape York and New Guinea. A cable laying ship, the SS Mernoo, was chartered, and two old cables that {{ran across the}} Bass Strait were lifted and re-laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943. When the land connections were completed in December 1943, it became possible {{to send a message}} all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby.

5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, {{following}} years of rising tension, the French Republic that {{had emerged from}} the French Revolution declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the Royal Navy {{one of the most}} immediate concerns was to contain the French Atlantic Fleet based in the massively fortified harbour at Brest in Brittany. This port was ideally positioned to disrupt the merchant shipping convoys that passed through the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay en route to Britain from all over the world, and it was therefore imperative that the French fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged. For the French, Brest was a vital port for <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> grain supplies from the Americas and so French fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into the harbour and to disrupt British convoys entering the English Channel.|$|E

Authorities stated that the information that he provided in return was false because the house in which he said Holloway's body was located had not yet been built {{at the time of her}} disappearance. On June 3, Van der Sloot was charged in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama with extortion and wire fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance obtained an arrest warrant and transmitted it to Interpol. On June 30, Van der Sloot was indicted on the charges.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{consisted}} of about forty missionaries, {{some of whom}} were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return, which Gregory refused, and instead sending Augustine back with letters to encourage the missionaries to persevere. Another reason for the pause may have been <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> news of the death of King Childebert II, who had been expected to help the missionaries; Augustine may have returned to Rome to secure new instructions and letters of introduction, as well as to update Gregory on the new political situation in Gaul. Most likely, they halted in the Rhone valley. Gregory also took the opportunity to name Augustine as abbot of the mission. Augustine then returned to the rest of the missionaries, with new instructions, probably including orders to seek consecration as a bishop on the Continent if the conditions in Kent warranted it.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{classical}} name for Japan, Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony.

5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later.

5|$|The victory {{consolidated}} Vitalian's position. With the spoils, he {{was able}} to lavishly reward his followers, and at the news of the imperial army's annihilation, the remaining cities and forts in Lower Moesia and Scythia surrendered to him. Soon after, he had another stroke of luck: at Sozopolis, his men captured an embassy sent by Anastasius to ransom Hypatius, including the ransom money of 1,100 pounds of gold. Hypatius, whom Vitalian hated because he had once insulted his wife, was not released until a year later. In 514, Vitalian marched again towards Constantinople, this time gathering, in addition to his army, a fleet of 200 vessels from the Black Sea ports, which sailed down the Bosporus menacing the city from the sea as well. Anastasius was further disquieted by riots in the city, which left many casualties, and resolved to once again negotiate with Vitalian. Vitalian accepted, on the conditions of his nomination to the post of magister militum per Thracias and <b>the</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> ransom money and gifts worth in total 5,000 pounds of gold for the release of Hypatius. Anastasius also conceded the removal of the changes from the Trisagion, the restoration of the deposed Chalcedonian bishops, and the convocation of a general church council at Constantinople on 1 July 515.|$|E
