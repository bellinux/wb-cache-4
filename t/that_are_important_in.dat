5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that miR-122 is regulated by Rev-ErbA alpha which is involved in circadian gene expression, suggesting that miR-122 is a circadian metabolic regulator. miR-122 regulates the expression of several mRNA molecules <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the circadian cycle, such as PPARβ/δ. Mature miR-122 is subject to modification by the poly(A) polymerase GLD-2, which adds a single adenosine to the miRNA 3' end. This results {{in an increase in}} miR-122 stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} amplitudes {{described}} above {{is relevant to}} quantum state vectors. It is also used {{in the context of}} unitary operators <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the scattering theory, notably in the form of S-matrices. Whereas moduli of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, moduli of matrix elements squared are interpreted as transition probabilities just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional unit vector specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional unitary matrix specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states. Note that columns of a unitary matrix, as vectors, have the norm 1.|$|E

The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island.

The fact that such bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other celestial bodies, both within and beyond the solar system.|$|E
500|$|The Human Genome Project has {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} numerous viral DNA sequences scattered throughout [...] the human genome. These sequences make up around eight per cent of human DNA, and {{appear to be the}} remains of ancient retrovirus infections of human ancestors. These pieces of DNA have firmly established themselves in human DNA. Most of this DNA is no longer functional, but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel genes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> human development. Viruses have transferred important genes to plants. About ten per cent of all photosynthesis uses the products of genes that have been transferred to plants from blue-green algae by viruses.|$|E

2500|$|Systems biology {{approaches}} to Alzheimer’s disease that consider the biochemical pathways <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> CNS disease evolution {{have been developed}} by research that was funded outside NASA. Figure 6-8 shows a schematic of the biochemical pathways <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued. Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros [...] have developed an in silico model of senile plaques {{that are related to}} Alzheimer’s disease. In this model, the biochemical interactions among TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 are described within several important cell populations, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Further, in this model soluble amyloid causes microglial chemotaxis and activates IL-1B secretion. Figure 6-9 shows the results of the Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros model simulating plaque formation and neuronal death. Establishing links between space radiation-induced changes to the changes that are described in this approach can be pursued to develop an in silico model of Alzheimer’s disease that results from space radiation.|$|E

[...] While on some of the islands there are stories of spirits creating the islands, a creation story that is found on many of the islands is that te Pusi mo te Ali (the Eel and the Flounder) created the islands of Tuvalu; te Ali (the Flounder) {{is believed to be the}} origin of the flat atolls of Tuvalu and the te Pusi (the Eel) is the model for the coconut palms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the lives of Tuvaluans.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of masonic manuscripts <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the study of the {{emergence}} of Freemasonry. Most numerous are the Old Charges or Constitutions. These documents outlined a [...] "history" [...] of masonry, tracing its origins to a biblical or classical root, followed by the regulations of the organisation, and the responsibilities of its different grades. More rare are old hand-written copies of ritual, affording a limited understanding of early masonic rites. All of those which pre-date the formation of Grand Lodges are found in Scotland and Ireland, and show such similarity that the Irish rituals are usually assumed to be of Scottish origin. The earliest Minutes of lodges formed before the first Grand Lodge are also located in Scotland. Early records of the first Grand Lodge in 1717 allow an elementary understanding of the immediate pre-Grand Lodge era and some insight into the personalities and events that shaped early 18th century Freemasonry in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{relatively}} few minerals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> {{the formation of}} common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term [...] "trace element" [...] is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).|$|E

2500|$|As {{chemical}} {{treatments are}} often ineffective for long term control and mechanical removal is likewise difficult and costly for long-term control, kudzu {{makes a good}} candidate for biological control. There are several biological means that are already in place and more that may be implemented to control the growth of kudzu. Bacterial blights, insect herbivory, and insect seed predation occur in high levels in field populations of kudzu. [...] Seed predation is quite prevalent, with up to 81% of seeds incurring damage in populations studied in North Carolina. A different survey found twenty-five different species of insect feeding on the kudzu. From this survey, several leaf-feeding beetles and sawflies that have no other known hosts were identified. [...] A separate study also found two weevils that attacked the stems of kudzu and eight beetles that complete larval development in the kudzu roots. When evaluations of potential control agents are made, the range of the control agents must be taken into account. Organisms that feed on kudzu will often feed on similar non-target species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> agriculture such as soybeans and hog-peanuts. Potential control agents have to be rejected if they are shown in lab and field tests to feed on these non-target plants.|$|E
