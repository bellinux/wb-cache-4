Comment The title compound, (I), {{also known as}} <b>tioxolone,</b> {{has been used in}} the treatment of acne due to its sulfur content (Lius & Sennerfeldt, 1979). It is reported to possess cytostatic (Goeth & Wildfeuer, 1969), antipsoriatic, antibacterial and anti-mycotic properties (Wildfeuer, 1970). It is also added to some cosmetics (e. g. hair shampoos and skin cleansers), due to claims for its oil-regulating and antibacterial properties. The bond lengths and angles in (I) are as expected (Table 1) for this almost planar molecule, where the greatest torsion angle deviation from zero or 180 is seen for C 2 ÐO 1 ÐC 7 Ð O 2 [ÿ 177. 49 (18) ]. For simple molecules of this kind, with...|$|E
