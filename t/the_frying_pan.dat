5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel were {{generally}} {{light in the}} southeastern portion of the state. Sustained winds reached 72mph (116km/h) offshore in <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> <b>Pan</b> Shoals, where a gust of 82mph (132km/h) was also reported. Sustained winds were lighter along the coast, peaking at 45mph (72km/h) at the Wilmington International Airport, while gusts reached 66mph (106km/h) at a North Carolina State Ports Authority facility in Wilmington. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as Lumberton, where gusts reached 52mph (54km/h). The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51inches (115mm) in Whiteville. Additionally, weather radars estimated over 5inches (125mm) of precipitation fell in portions of New Hanover County. The rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1foot (0.3m) above normal, though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22feet (1m). Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near Cape Fear and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of Cape Fear.|$|E
5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) southeast of <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> <b>Pan</b> Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters {{to aid the}} ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of growing}} {{territorial}} domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established. Then Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1701) had most likely {{spent much of}} his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Ecija, Andalusia in Spain. Ecija, Andalusia was also known as la sarten or <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> because of its intensely hot summers. Thus the Governor-General hit upon the notion to name the outpost Nueva Ecija. Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Rio Grande de Pampanga and the latter, by the river Genil.|$|E

On account of this, {{it has been suggested}} that they received libations in some kind of fertility rite; sea, Sun and femininity may have been seen as symbols of the fertility of the body and the sea, which was essential for human life.|$|R

50|$|Eschscholzia lobbii is {{a species}} of poppy known by <b>the</b> common name <b>frying</b> <b>pans.</b> It is endemic to California, where it grows in the Central Valley and {{adjacent}} Sierra Nevada foothills. <b>The</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pans</b> is a small annual herb growing from a patch of segmented leaves with pointed leaflets. It produces erect stalks up to 15 centimeters in height each bearing a single poppy flower. The petals are about a centimeter long and bright yellow to somewhat orange.

Among his stage work, he {{performed}} in André Birabeau's French comedy Head of the Family, Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn, Bernard Kops's Change for the Angel, Francis Swann's Out of <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> <b>Pan,</b> Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Coriolanus, and Twelfth Night, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, The Striplings, The Move After Checkmate and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School, Emergency - Ward 10, Probation Officer, and Two Living, One Dead. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series Sir Francis Drake, a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring Terence Morgan and Jean Kent. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, Blow Your Own Trumpet and Soapbox Derby, for The Children's Film Foundation in Britain.|$|E
500|$|These {{theories}} are intermixed {{in the local}} legend of <b>the</b> <b>Frying</b> <b>Pan</b> Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. [...] According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans {{at the home of}} Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. [...] Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. [...] Langlois introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine [...] rice, shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use {{by those who are}} acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: it does not take long to cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|E

However, because the area had been experiencing drought conditions, the flooding was not as severe as it could have potentially been. The most significant flooding occurred near the Cape Fear River, where high waters were reported. The highest storm surge occurred along the beaches of Brunswick County, mostly reaching [...] above average. Elsewhere, flooding was mostly limited to locations with poor drainage and low-lying areas. Coastal flooding was not widespread, though surge in the Pungo River flooded several local homes. Other coastal flooding was reported in various harbors and coastal cities. Part of North Carolina Highway 12 was flooded and closed on Hatteras Island due to tidal flooding. At North Topsail Beach, many of the protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were destroyed, and along the Bogue Banks, tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef, were washed ashore.|$|E
2500|$|Donating {{scrap metal}} was another {{means by which}} Americans could help support the war effort. [...] Scrap Happy Daffy was a short film that {{encouraged}} such patriotic acts. [...] Daffy defends his scrap yard against a metal-eating Nazi goat sent by an irate Adolf Hitler. [...] The cartoon asks citizens to donate {{to the war effort}} by listing items which can be given to scrap yards around the country. [...] It also educates citizens about Hitler’s spies and spoilers who try to hinder such war efforts. [...] Other films pleading for scrap metal include Ding Dong Daddy and Foney Fables.

2500|$|Poems in Two Volumes was poorly {{reviewed}} by Wordsworth's contemporaries, including Lord Byron, whom Wordsworth came to despise.

Wordsworth himself wrote ahead to soften the thoughts of The Critical Review, hoping his friend Francis Wrangham would push for a softer approach. He succeeded in preventing a known enemy from writing the review, but it didn't help; as Wordsworth himself said, {{it was a case of}} [...] "Out of <b>the</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan,</b> into the fire". Of any positives within Poems in Two Volumes, the perceived masculinity in The Happy Warrior, written on the death of Nelson and unlikely to be the subject of attack, was one such.
