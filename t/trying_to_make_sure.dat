Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.|$|E

[...] The friend also said that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting {{in the back of the}} car <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their mother was still breathing.|$|E

500|$|DecembeRadio felt {{pressure}} to meet growing expectations following the accolades received for their previous album, DecembeRadio (2006), which won a Gospel Music Association Dove Award and {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award. [...] "We had some great stuff go on with the first record, but I think the biggest thing {{over the past two years}} has been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live. [...] Thus it was the band's goal to [...] "make sure every single song on the [...] album worked well in a live concert setting", according to Bunn.|$|E

He stated that he was looking to [...] "bring some of the socially conscious nature" [...] of Jessica Jones and his series American Crime to the show, while also creating something that is [...] "straight entertainment". A year later, Channing Dungey revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script. Ridley added that the rewrite was not because [...] "anything didn't work the first time around", but rather <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy [...] "a space that is not currently being filled" [...] by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series [...] "in the near term." [...] By August 2017, Dungey was [...] "not sure" [...] if Ridley was still working on the project.|$|E

[...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that."

500|$|Disagreements between female rapper Remy Ma and Minaj {{originated}} in 2007, when Remy {{took note of}} Minaj's freestyle record, nicknamed [...] "Dirty Money", from her mixtape Playtime Is Over (2007). In the record, Minaj recites: [...] "Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown/she won three rounds, I'ma need a hundred thou/like 'Chinatown' — bitches better bow down/oh you ain't know, betcha bitches know now/fuck I got a gun — {{let her know that}} I'm the one". When the two encountered each other at an industry party, Remy asked Minaj who she was dissing in the song. Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day I still feel like [...] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added that she would be [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales."

2500|$|Journalist/critic Frank Lovece in Newsday contrasted {{the humor}} {{tradition}} of Groening's two series, finding that, [...] "The Simpsons echoes {{the strains of}} American-Irish vaudeville humor— the beer-soaked, sneaking-in-late-while-the-wife's-asleep comedy of Harrigan and Hart, McNulty and Murray, the Four Cohans (which, yes, included George M.) and countless others: knockabout yet sentimental, and ultimately about the bonds of blood family. Futurama, conversely, stems from Jewish-American humor, {{and not just in}} the obvious archetype of Dr. Zoidberg. From vaudeville to the Catskills to Woody Allen, it's that distinctly rueful humor built to ward away everything from despair to petty annoyance— the 'You gotta do what you gotta do' philosophy that helps the 'Futurama' characters cope in a mega-corporate world where the little guy is essentially powerless." [...] Animation maven Jerry Beck concurred: [...] "I'm Jewish, and I know what you're saying. Fry has that , Dr. Zoidberg, all the [...] Billy West characters. I see it.

Ulrich also told The Straits Times that same day that the band would be filming music videos for all twelve tracks on the album, using YouTube as their platform. [...] "Now that YouTube is the world's biggest television station, we figured we may as well knock a video out for every song... the practicality of shooting twelve music videos is kind of crazy, especially when you're trying to promote your record, and you're all over the place, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it doesn't leak.
