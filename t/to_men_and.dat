Although 17th-century midwives recommended <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women that women should aspire to achieve orgasms {{to help them get}} pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably in the work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E

5|$|Membership in B'nai Israel was {{restricted}} <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> {{attendance at the}} (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard {{the image of the}} small Jewish congregation {{in the eyes of the}} much larger Christian community. New members had to be approved by a secret ballot, and existing members could blackball candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha is {{credited}} in Jainism to have invented and taught fire, cooking, and all skills needed {{for human beings}} to live. In total, Rishabhanatha {{is said to have}} taught seventy-two sciences <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> sixty-four to women. According to Paul Dundas, Rishabhanatha in Jain mythology is thus not merely a spiritual teacher but one who founded knowledge in its various forms and a form of culture hero for the current cosmological cycle.|$|E
5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century.

The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E

5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever {{the nature of the}} work, and for equal pay with men for equal work.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

Mona El-Hawary, competing in the women's skeet, was 17th and last in her event, but still ranked higher than any other Egyptian shooter. She was also {{a veteran of the}} 2008 Summer Olympics. The other woman, Nourhan Amer, was 41st of 56 competitors in the 10 metre air rifle. She had won three medals in team events at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. Egypt's best-ranked man was Mostafa Hamdy, a veteran of the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Olympic tournaments, who was 18th among 36 participants in the men's skeet. Azmy Mehelba, the 2011 Pan Arab runner up, also competed in the skeet, but was last. Ahmed Zaher, in the trap, was 22nd of 34 competitors, while Karim Wagih was 38th of 44 participants in the 10 metre air pistol. Amgad Hosen, a team gold medalist from the 2011 Pan Arab Games, finished 29th out of 47 competitors in the 10 metre air rifle.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean shaft graves are {{essentially}} an Argive {{variant of the}} rudimentary Middle Helladic funerary tradition with features derived from Early Bronze Age traditions developed locally in mainland Greece. Grave Circle A, formed circa 1600 BC as a new elite burial place, was probably first restricted <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> {{seems to be a}} continuation of the earlier Grave Circle B and correlates with the general social trend of higher burial investment taking place throughout entire Greece that time. The Grave Circle A site {{was part of a larger}} funeral place from the Middle Helladic period. At the time it was built, during the Late Helladic I (1600 BC), there was probably a small unfortified palace on Mycenae, while the graves of the Mycenaean ruling family remained outside of the city walls. There is no evidence of a circular wall around the site during the period of the burials. The last interment took place circa 1500 BC.|$|E
5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{was open}} <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, and both genders were {{entitled}} companions. Until 1476, {{there were no}} limits {{on the number of}} companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60; unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar requirements for membership. The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth—eight generations of noble grandparents—and of unblemished reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{equality}} {{of men and}} women is a fundamental Bahá'í principle, that is explicit in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and particularly in the writings and discourses of `Abdu'l-Bahá, his son and chosen interpreter. The teaching and its vision of the community is central to Bahá'í community life as is implemented at a practical level. The Bahá'í teachings state that women are not inferior <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> should not be subordinate to men in aspects of social life. In the Bahá'í view, women have always been equal <b>to</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> the reason why women have so far not achieved this equality is {{due to the lack of}} adequate educational and social opportunities, and because men have used their greater physical strength to prevent women from developing their true potential.|$|E
