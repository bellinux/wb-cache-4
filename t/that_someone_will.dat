5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E

It spent $4.7 million over several years to restore the original porch and put in a geothermal heating system. The project won a 2007 Excellence in Preservation Award from the Historic Preservation League, and RUPCO has leased out space for commercial and residential use. It is hoping <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> be able to reopen the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E

25|$|When Mark's girlfriend Hermia {{does not}} take his growing fears seriously, he becomes disaffected with her. He does, however, receive support from Ariadne Oliver, and from a vicar's wife (Mrs Dane Calthrop) who desires him to stop {{whatever}} evil may be taking place. He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him {{the means by which}} the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> die within {{a certain period of time}} and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).|$|E

500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> come {{up with the idea of}} spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E

500|$|That night, Elspeth sneaks {{into the}} Doctor’s office to {{retrieve}} a map and compass, but on finding forbidden books and maps from before the Great White, the [...] "Beforetime", she realises they must be searching for something from long ago. She leaves empty-handed. Rosamunde, a fellow orphan from the Kinraide orphan home, arrives at Obernewtyn and coldly informs Elspeth that her brother Jes had discovered he also had mental abilities, but was killed by guards in an escape attempt. Rushton comforts the distraught Elspeth, and asks her why she plagues him. Fearful <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> soon be after her as well, her group’s escape plans begin in earnest. Elspeth returns a second time to the Doctor’s office, but when Vega, Alexi and Ariel enter, she learns Ariel {{is part of the}} Obernewtyn family, and that they are searching for a Misfit to help them find the location of Beforetime weapons. Pre-warned that two Councilmen are coming to fetch her for questioning by the Herders, at nightfall she makes to escape but Rushton stops her. He reveals a secret network of drains which gets her safely to the farms. Once she is safely through the drains after a close shave with Ariel's pack of mad, wild wolves, she finds that the path to the farms has been obscured by a blizzard and gets lost. She nearly dies, but a Misfit named Domick finds her and locks her in the farmhouse to return later to Obernewtyn. Overhearing a conversation between her captors, she discovers they are Rushton's accomplices and were to secretly meet with a rebel group, but Rushton has gone missing. Convincing them that her powers can help find him, she makes her way on foot through the blizzard to the far mountains, with Maruman as her guide.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not known}} what causes PCS to occur and persist, or why some people who suffer a minor {{traumatic}} brain injury later develop PCS while others do not. [...] The nature of the syndrome and the diagnosis itself {{have been the subject}} of intense debate since the 19th century. However, certain risk factors have been identified; for example, preexisting medical or psychological conditions, expectations of disability, being female, and older age all increase the chances <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> suffer PCS. [...] Physiological and psychological factors present before, during, and after the injury are all thought to be involved in the development of PCS.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Paddick published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, {{he made a}} revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: [...] "Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn't prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put {{their lives on the}} line for the public." [...] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: [...] "Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> be held to account if something goes wrong. An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{to begin}} with perhaps I may meet an {{objection}} {{that is likely to}} arise. I have called this hypothetical book of ours the Bible of Civilization, and it may be <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>will</b> say: Yes, but you have a sufficient book of that sort already; you have the Bible itself and that is all you need. Well, I am taking the Bible as my model. I am taking it because twice in history--first as the Old Testament and then again as the Old and New Testament together--it has formed a culture, and unified and kept together through many generations great masses of people. It has been the basis of the Jewish and Christian civilizations alike. And even in the New World the State of Connecticut did, I believe, in its earliest beginnings take the Bible as its only law. Nevertheless, I hope I shall not offend any reader if I point out that the Bible is not all that we need to-day, and that also in some respects it is redundant. Its very virtues created its limitations. It served men so well that they made a Canon of it and refused to alter it further. Throughout the most vital phases of Hebrew history, throughout the most living years of Christian development the Bible changed and grew. Then its growth ceased and its text became fixed. But the world went on growing and discovering new needs and new necessities.|$|E
