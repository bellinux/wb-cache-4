5000|$|Brown rot causes blossom blight, twig blight; <b>twig</b> <b>canker</b> {{and fruit}} rot. [...] Brown rot {{is caused by}} a fungus that {{produces}} spores, and can be a major problem during particularly wet seasons. Prolonged wet weather during bloom may result in extensive blossom infection. The length of wet periods required for blossom infection depends upon the temperature. Humid wet conditions are when the fruit trees are most at risk from infection. Young green fruit can be infected just before autumn, but the infection often remains inactive until near maturity of the fruit. Brown rot can spread after harvest. Mature fruit can decay in only 2 days under warm conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of fusaria in symptomatic Citrus trees in Greece, Italy and Spain was evaluated using morphological and molecular multi-locus analyses based on {{fragments of the}} calmodulin (CAM), intergenic spacer region of the rDNA (IGS), internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA (ITS), large subunit of the rDNA (LSU), RNA polymerase largest subunit (RPB 1), RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB 2), translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF- 1 α) and beta-tubulin (TUB) genes. A total of 11 species (six Fusarium spp., and five Neocosmospora spp.) were isolated from dry root rot, crown, trunk or <b>twig</b> <b>canker</b> or twig dieback of citrus trees. The most commonly isolated species were Fusarium sarcochroum, F. oxysporum and Neocosmospora solani. Three new Fusarium species are described, i. e., F. citricola and F. salinense belonging to the newly described F. citricola species complex; and F. siculi belonging to the F. fujikuroi species complex. Results of pathogenicity tests showed this new complex to include prominent canker causing agents affecting several Citrus spp. In addition, two new species are described in Neocosmospora, named N. croci and N. macrospora, the latter species being clearly differentiated from most members of this genus by producing large, up to nine-septate sporodochial conidia...|$|E
40|$|Characterization {{of spatial}} {{patterns}} of plant disease can provide insights into important epidemiological {{processes such as}} sources of inoculum, mechanisms of dissemination, and reproductive strategies of the pathogen population. While two-dimensional patterns of disease (among plants within fields) have been studied extensively, there is limited information on three-dimensional patterns within individual plant canopies. Reported here are the detailed mapping of different symptom types of brown rot (caused by Monilinia laxa) in individual sour cherry tree (Prunus cerasus) canopies, {{and the application of}} spatial statistics to the resulting data points to de-termine patterns of symptom aggregation and association. Methods – A magnetic digitizer was uti-lized to create detailed three-dimensional maps of three symptom types (blossom blight, shoot blight, and <b>twig</b> <b>canker)</b> in eight sour cherry tree canopies during the green fruit stage of develop-ment. The resulting point patterns were analyzed for aggregation (within a given symptom type) and pairwise association (between symptom types) using a three-dimensional extension of nearest-neighbor analysis. Key Results – Symptoms of M. laxa infection were generally aggregated within the canopy volume, but there was no consistent pattern for one symptom type to be more or less aggre-gated than the other. Analysis of spatial association among symptom types indicated that previous year’s twig cankers may {{play an important role in}} influencing the spatial pattern of current year’s symptoms. This observation provides quantitative support for the epidemiological role of twig can-kers as sources of primary inoculum within the tree. Conclusions – Presented here is a new approach to quantify spatial patterns of plant disease in complex fruit tree canopies using point pattern anal-ysis. This work provides a framework for quantitative analysis of three-dimensional spatial patterns within the finite tree canopy, applicable to many fields of research...|$|E
50|$|W. carpophilus overwinters in {{infected}} buds and in <b>twig</b> <b>cankers.</b> Asexual spores (conidia) are dispersed {{in spring}} when moisture levels increase or {{as a result}} of overhead watering. Spores are pigmented and remain viable, in a dormant state, for months. Infection can occur any time moisture is present for at least 24 hours, as long as temperatures are above 36 °F.

40|$|Monilinia laxa is {{the causal}} agent of brown rot disease on stone fruits, and also causes blossom wilt and <b>twig</b> <b>canker.</b> The common {{practice}} used to manage this disease is through fungicide treatments. However the demand to reduce fungicide inputs {{has been increasing}} {{and there is a}} growing number of reports of M. laxa strains that are resistant to fungicides. There is an urgent need to search for an alternative strategy to control the disease. This study focused on the isolation and characterisation of biological control agents (BCAs) using indigenous isolates isolated from cherries and plums collected within the UK. A total of 192 isolates were screened against two strains of M. laxa in a series of in vitro dual culture tests. From this in vitro screen, 12 isolates were selected for a subsequent in vivo screen on detached fruits, which then narrowed these isolates down to two potential BCAs. These two strains were identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens/subtilis (isolate B 91) and Aureobasidium pullulans (isolate Y 126). The capability of these two potential BCAs to grow and survive at a range of temperatures likely to be experienced under field and storage conditions was studied in order to gain knowledge for product formulation and field application. Bacillus sp. B 91 was shown to be a mesophilic bacterium that could grow at 10 – 25 °C but suffered significant mortality at 0 and 5 °C, while A. pullulans Y 126 was both mesophilic and psychrotolerant as it grew between 0 – 25 °C with the optimum at 20 °C. When all nutrients were removed, Y 126 was able to survive for several weeks in all test temperatures (0 – 25 °C) but showed significant mortality at 25 °C. The capability of B 91 to survive at 20 and 25 °C was higher than at low temperatures (0 – 15 °C). In addition, the modes of action of the potential BCAs were studied. B 91 was shown to produce soluble and volatile organic compounds that inhibited M. laxa, while A. pullulans Y 126 did not produce inhibitory compounds, but appeared to inhibit the pathogen via competition for nutrients. This study shows that microbial antagonists against M. laxa can be found from indigenous sources and that they are capable of preventing brown rot disease in controlled conditions, thus demonstrating a potential to be developed into commercial products...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand flower thrips, Thrips obscuratus (Crawford) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is an {{important}} seasonal pest of peaches infesting flowers during spring and mature fruit prior to, and during fruit harvest. Thrips numbers were monitored during peach flowering and prior to fruit harvest in a 160 tree experimental orchard, using water traps, sticky traps on tree limbs, and by direct sampling of flowers and fruit. Thrips numbers in water traps in the spring were low compared to summer samples. Adult thrips were found in peach flowers from pink to shuck fall with peak numbers during full bloom. Relatively low numbers of thrips were caught on sticky traps placed on tree stems in the spring which supports the notion that thrips numbers in the spring are low. Very high numbers of thrips (> 1, 000 thrips/ trap/ week) were caught in water traps prior to, and during fruit harvest. Adult thrips were found on peach fruit from three weeks prior to harvest with peak numbers at full fruit ripeness. During rain thrips moved to protected areas {{on the bottom of}} the fruit presumably to avoid being washed off the fruit. The association between thrips and Monilinia fructicola (Winter) Honey inoculum sites was studied using sticky traps placed near <b>twig</b> <b>cankers</b> and fruit mummies, and by counting thrips numbers on brown rot diseased sporulating fruit. Adult thrips were caught on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected <b>twig</b> <b>cankers</b> in the spring and summer, and on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected fruit mummies in the spring. Spring sticky trap catches showed a similar trend to water trap catches with peak thrips numbers caught in traps when the flowers were at or near shuck fall. Summer sticky trap catches were much higher than spring catches. Thrips were found on brown rot infected sporulating peach fruit in comparable numbers to thrips found on healthy peach fruit. Peak numbers of adult thrips were found on diseased fruit with a low sporulation severity. At high sporulation severities few thrips were found on diseased fruit. A thrips-washing method was developed and viable M. fructicola spores were enumerated on thrips removed from <b>twig</b> <b>cankers,</b> fruit mummies, and fruit exhibiting sporulating brown rot lesions. Two methods were developed to follow thrips dispersal of M. fructicola in and between peach trees in the spring and summer. Feeding thrips rubidium and assaying thrips for rubidium content was feasible in the laboratory, but due to the high number of thrips required for field experiments and associated difficulties in feeding large numbers of thrips rubidium, the method was not suitable for following thrips dispersal in the field. Thrips treated with spores of a fungicide-resistant strain of M. fructicola dispersed spores to flowers and fruit in the field with disease resulting. In all experiments most fungicide-resistant strain diseased flowers and fruit were found on the tree the thrips had been released onto, followed by trees in the same row as the release tree, and then across tree rows. Controlled environment studies showed increasing brown rot disease incidence and severity in flowers with increasing numbers of thrips per flower and increasing spore loads on the thrips. Thrips deposited spores onto fungicide-treated fruit which resulted in disease, thereby apparently negating the benefits of fungicide protection. A field experiment was conducted to compare the incidence of brown rot disease in peaches at harvest in the presence and absence of thrips. Brown rot disease incidence on fruit at harvest where thrips were excluded by using an insecticide was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than on fruit where water was applied and thrips numbers were higher. Laboratory experiments showed that thrips did not predispose flowers to infection and disease as thrips applied as a pre-treatment to flowers prior to M. fructicola spore application did not increase disease incidence. A possible explanation for this was the high susceptibility of flowers to infection. A single spore application method was developed and single spores were found to act independently in the infection process, with only one spore required for flower infection. There were differences found in the susceptibility of flower parts to infection with filaments being the most susceptible to infection followed by anthers, stigmas, and petals. The practical implications of thrips dispersal of M. fructicola were discussed as thrips were shown to be {{an important}} factor in brown rot epidemiology in Canterbury peach orchards...|$|R
40|$|A fruit rot {{resembling}} Gloeosporium infections but {{appearing on}} fruits prior to harvest was noticed in organic apple orchards in Holland, Belgium and Northern Germany in 2007. Infections were most commonly observed on ‘Elstar’, but other cultivars were also affected. Fruit colonisation progressed in two steps, whereby a latent stage of sunken black lesions in immature fruits {{gave rise to}} a rapidly spreading firm brown rot upon fruit ripening. Isolation experiments from both stages consistently yielded a single species of fungus identified as Diplodia seriata, formerly known under the teleomorph name Botryosphaeria obtusa. Lesions of D. seriata were also seen on leaves as necrotic light brown spots surrounded by a purple halo, and occasionally on small <b>twigs</b> as <b>cankers.</b> Fruit mummies on apple twigs were heavily colonised by D. seriata and are thus likely to carry inoculum for fruit infections during late summer or in the following growing season...|$|R
40|$|Most {{trees and}} shrubs are {{susceptible}} to dieback and cankers caused by several species of the fungal genus Botryosphaeria. Botryosphaeria fungi are typically opportunistic pathogens. Opportunistic pathogens only cause disease on plants that are stressed. Therefore, avoiding plant stress, which predisposes plant tissue to infection and colonization by this fungal group, is the best strategy to prevent Botryosphaeria disease problems.

40|$|Isolates of Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey {{obtained}} from stone fruit orchards in Hawkes Bay, North Island and from Californian fruit exported to New Zealand, were tested for resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC). Resistant isolates from the North Island had EC₅₀ values of > 30, 000, and most isolates from the imported fruit had of values approximately 1. 5 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. Sensitive isolates failed to grow on 1 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. A detached peach shoot system {{was used in}} controlled conditions for estimation of values for incubation period, latent period and rate of spore production on flowers (cv Glohaven). The same variables {{and the rate of}} colonisation of host tissue were measured on fruit (cv Fantasia) in controlled conditions. An inoculum density of 1 x 10 ⁴ spore/flower or fruit greatly increased fitness in vivo compared to an inoculum density of 1 x 10 ² spore/flower (fruit). Isolates varied considerably, but there was no consistent relationship between the degrees of resistance and fitness. This was in contrast to earlier studies with dicarboximide resistant strains of M. fructicola. The survival in the field of 10 isolates resistant or sensitive to MBC or dicarboximide fungicides on <b>twig</b> <b>cankers</b> and mummified fruit was compared. The ability to produce conidia on <b>twig</b> <b>cankers</b> inoculated in late spring 1989 was maintained by all sensitive and MBC resistant isolates for at least 1 year. The production of conidia on mummified fruit inoculated in February 1990 decreased after 2 - 3 months in the field but some conidia were still produced on all fruit in the following spring. Dicarboximide resistant isolates produced less conidia than either the MBC resistant and the sensitive isolates. The pathogenicity and fitness of all isolates were similar to the original values after survival for 1 year. A technique was developed to produce apothecia reliably from inoculated peach (cv Black Boy) and nectarine (cv Fantasia) fruit in controlled conditions in the laboratory. The fruit were inoculated with resistant or sensitive isolates, or combinations, and were incubated for 8 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) with 12 hours photoperiod of fluorescent light (Sylvania 2 x 65 W, daylight) to produce mummified fruit. The fruit were then buried in moist autoclaved peat moss for 10 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) in the dark to form stromata. These fruit were then hydrated with running tap-water (total hardness (CaCO₃) = 47 g/m³ and conductivity at 20 °C = 12. 7 mS/m) for 72 hours. The hydrated mummified fruit were placed in moist peat moss and were incubated for 13 - 14 weeks at 8 °C (± 0. 5 °C) in the dark. At the end of this period, stipe initials were visible. Differentiation of stipe initials into mature apothecia occurred within 15 - 20 days after transfer to 12 °C (± 2 °C) with a 12 hour photoperiod of fluorescent and incandescent light. All isolates produced apothecia when treated in this way. A technique for isolation of ascospore sets in linear arrangement was developed for tetrad analysis of the inheritance of resistance. At least 3 hours of fluorescent and incandescent light at 12 °C (± 2 °C) was essential to allow ascospore ejection from individual asci taken from apothecia previously maintained in a 12 hour photoperiod at 12 °C (± 1 °C). A water film on the surface of water agar was necessary to hold a set of ejected ascospores in linear sequence. Single ascospores were obtained in sequence {{with the aid of a}} micromanipulator. Genetic analysis of MBC resistant isolates was carried out on ascospores derived from apothecia produced in the laboratory. Analysis of ascospore sets in linear arrangement and ascospore populations indicated that resistance to > 30, 000 mg a. i. /l carbendazim (high-resistant) is governed by a single major gene and is affected by gene conversion mechanisms. Crossing over was frequent, suggesting that recombination of resistance with other characters, such as pathogenicity and fitness, may occur readily. The segregation ratio (1 : 1) from most resistant isolates revealed that heterokaryons containing both resistant and sensitive alleles were common in resistant populations and that resistance is dominant. Allozyme analysis of ascospore progeny through electrophoresis revealed a narrow genetic base of M. fructicola in New Zealand. The technique for reliable apothecial production in controlled conditions developed in this study provided an important step for the determination of the biology of M. fructicola strains resistant to MBC fungicides, and the complexity of its life cycle. Genetic heterogeneity in field populations can be conserved in one isolate through heterokaryosis, thus providing for adaptability of the pathogen to the changing environmental conditions. Knowledge on genetic variability, overwintering ability, pathogenicity and fitness factors may be useful for future management strategies of stone fruit brown rot. Special emphasis should be made in particular to prevent primary infection on blossoms, which would delay the establishment of recombinant strains of M. fructicola and the onset of brown rot epidemics...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial canker of mango (or {{bacterial}} black spot), {{caused by}} Xanthomonas citri pv. mangiferaeindicae, is an economically important disease in tropical and subtropical producing areas (1). X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae can cause severe infection {{in a wide}} range of mango cultivars and induces raised, angular, black leaf lesions, sometimes with a chlorotic halo. Several months after infection, leaf lesions dry and turn light brown or ash gray. Severe leaf infection may result in abscission. Fruit symptoms appear as small water-soaked spots on the lenticels. These spots later become star shaped, erumpent, and exude an infectious gum. Often, a "tear stain" infection pattern is observed on the fruit. Severe fruit infections will cause premature fruit drop. <b>Twig</b> <b>cankers</b> are potential sources of inoculum and weaken resistance of branches to wind damage. Leaf lesions with suspected bacterial canker were collected in January 2010 from mango trees cv. Keitt in several blocks at the Integrated Tamale Fruit Company, Ghana. Non-pigmented Xanthomonas-like bacterial colonies were isolated on Kasugamycin-Cephalexin semiselective agar medium (3). On the basis of IS 1595 -Ligation Mediated-PCR data, 16 strains from Ghana produced identical fingerprints and were identified as X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae (4). The haplotype corresponding to the Ghanaian strains had not been previously reported. On the basis of multidimensional scaling (4), this haplotype clustered together with a group of strains from multiple origins and the analysis was not informative as an aid for tracing back the outbreak. Five Ghanaian strains (LH 2 - 3, LH 2 - 6, LH 2 - 8, LH 2 - 11, and LH 2 - 15) were compared by multilocus sequence analysis to the type strain of X. citri and the pathotype strain of several X. citri pathovars, including pvs. anacardii and mangiferaeindicae. This assay targeted the atpD, dnaK, efp, and gyrB genes as described previously (2). Nucleotide sequences were 100 % identical to those of the pathotype strain of X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae whatever the gene assayed, but differed from any other assayed X. citri pathovar. Mango cv. Maison Rouge leaves from the youngest vegetative flush were infiltrated (10 inoculation sites per leaf, three replicate plants) using inoculum of each of the same five Ghanaian strains made from suspensions in Tris buffer containing ~ 1 × 105 CFU/ml. Negative control treatments consisted of leaves infiltrated with sterile Tris buffer. Typical symptoms of bacterial canker were observed for all assayed strains a week after inoculation. No lesions were recorded from the negative control. One month after inoculation, mean X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae population sizes ranging from 4 × 107 to 1 × 108 CFU/lesion were recovered from leaf lesions, typical of a compatible interaction (1). High disease prevalence was observed in Ghana, indicating the suitability of environmental conditions in this region for the development of mango bacterial canker. The budwood for these blocks was imported from Burkina Faso in 2002 and symptoms were observed in these blocks shortly after establishment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mango bacterial canker in Western Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Xanthomonas citri pv. mangiferaeindicae, {{causal agent}} of {{bacterial}} canker (or bacterial black spot), {{is a major}} pathogen of mango. The bacterium infects leaves, twigs, and fruit {{on a wide range}} of mango cultivars with severe defoliation and up to 80 % in fruit losses (Gagnevin and Pruvost 2001). Bacterial canker has recently emerged in western Africa. In 2010 it was first reported in Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Mali and subsequently in the Ivory Coast and Benin in 2014 (Zombré et al. 2015). Mango leaves showing typical symptoms of bacterial canker were first observed in August 2015 in five regions of Togo (Savanes, Kara, Centrale, Plateaux, and Maritime). Lesions were black, slightly raised and angular, and sometimes contained a chlorotic halo. Later in the season, fruit symptoms consisted of small water-soaked spots around lenticels that later developed into black, star shaped erumpent lesions. Moreover, <b>twig</b> <b>cankers</b> were also observed sporadically. High disease prevalence was observed in Togo, especially in the three northern provinces (Savanes, Kara, and Centrale). The wide distribution of bacterial canker in Togo suggests that the pathogen may have been present for some years before being identified. Diseased mango leaves were collected for isolation of the agent from all provinces but Maritime. Nonpigmented Xanthomonas -like colonies were readily isolated on KC medium (Pruvost et al. 2005). Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) targeting four housekeeping genes (atpD, dnaK, efp, and gyrB) (Bui Thi Ngoc et al. 2010) showed 100 % sequence identity among 11 Togo strains (LL 322 to LL 332). These sequences were 100 % identical to those of the pathotype strain (CFBP 1716) of X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae (LL 322 GenBank accessions KX 171407 to KX 171410), but differed from any other assayed X. citri pathovars, including pv. anacardii. Attached leaves of 6 -month-old potted mango cv. Maison Rouge from the youngest vegetative flush were infiltrated (10 inoculation sites per leaf for three replicate leaves on three different plants per bacterial strain) with suspensions of eight Togo strains. Bacterial suspensions (∼ 1 × 10 5 CFU/ml) were prepared in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7. 2) from 16 -h-old cultures on YPGA (Ah-You et al. 2007). The negative control treatment consisted of three leaves infiltrated with sterile Tris buffer (10 sites per leaf; one leaf per plant). Plants were incubated in a growth chamber at 30 ± 1 °C day and 26 ± 1 °C night (12 -h day/night cycle) at 80 ± 5 % relative humidity. All leaves inoculated with the Togo strains produced typical bacterial canker symptoms a week after inoculation. No lesions were recorded from the negative control. X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae population sizes recovered from leaf lesions 21 days after inoculation ranged from 4 × 10 7 to 8 × 10 8 CFU/lesion, typical of a compatible interaction (Ah-You et al. 2007). Colonies recovered from lesions were identified as the target by atpD sequencing (Bui Thi Ngoc et al. 2010). Koch's postulates have therefore been fulfilled. The wide distribution and high prevalence of the pathogen emphasizes the need for implementing integrated pest management in groves and nurseries. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Maison Rouge from the youngest vegetative flush were infiltrated (10 inoculation sites per leaf for three replicate leaves on different plants per bacterial strain) with the same five strains from Mali. Bacterial suspensions (~ 1 × 105 CFU/ml) were prepared in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7. 2) from 16 -h-old cultures on YPGA (7 g of yeast, 7 g of peptone, 7 g of glucose, and 18 g of agar/liter, pH 7. 2). The negative control treatment consisted of three leaves infiltrated with sterile Tris buffer (10 sites per leaf). Plants were incubated in a growth chamber at 30 ± 1 °C by day and 26 ± 1 °C by night (12 -h/ 12 -h day/night cycle) at 80 ± 5 % relative humidity. All leaves inoculated with the Malian strains showed typical symptoms of bacterial canker a week after inoculation. No lesions were recorded from the negative controls. One month after inoculation, mean X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae population sizes ranging from 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 CFU/lesion were recovered from leaf lesions, typical of a compatible interaction (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the disease in Mali. Investigations from local growers suggest that the disease may have been present for some years in Mali but likely less than a decade. A high disease incidence and severity were observed, suggesting the suitability of environmental conditions in this region for the development of mango bacterial canker. (Texte intégral...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} the EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{to perform a}} pest categorisation of Diaporthe vaccinii Shear, the fungal agent responsible for <b>twig</b> blight, <b>canker,</b> viscid rot, fruit rot and storage rot of several Vaccinium species. The pest is listed in Annex IIAI of Directive 2000 / 29 EC. D. vaccinii is a single taxonomic entity and methods exist for its discriminative detection. The host is restricted to Vaccinium species, the main cultivated hosts being blueberries and cranberries. Hosts are cultivated throughout Europe, and wild Vaccinium species are common components of forests. Conditions are conducive to disease development in most areas of Europe, but not in all Member States (MSs). The disease is currently present in Latvia with restricted distribution and the pest is under surveillance in The Netherlands. In the one Latvian report, storage losses were observed on cranberry, but these losses were caused by a complex of pathogens, including D. vaccinii, which was isolated with a low incidence. Detection methods are available but cultural and morphological identifications should be confirmed with molecular tools owing {{to the presence of}} other Phomopsis species on Vaccinium in Europe. The pathogen can spread via the movement of (asymptomatic) infected or contaminated host plants for planting. No information exists on any methods applied for the control of D. vaccinii in the EU. D. vaccinii does not have {{the potential to be a}} quarantine pest as it does not fulfil one of the pest categorisation criteria defined in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 11, that of having a severe impact. Data are not sufficient to conclude on pest categorisation of D. vaccinii based on the criteria of the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 21 because there is no information about the level of potential consequences as a result of the use of infected host plants for planting...|$|R
40|$|Between 2010 and 2013 several English holly trees showing defoliation, {{leaf and}} twig blight {{were found in}} natural {{ecosystems}} in Sardinia and Corsica. A Phytophthora species was consistently isolated from necrotic tissues of leaves and <b>twigs,</b> and bleeding <b>cankers</b> on stems. Isolates obtained were identified as Phytophthora ilicis, {{on the basis of}} morphological features, colony patterns and growth rates at different temperatures. Identity was confirmed by sequence analyses of the ITS, β-tubulin and cox 1 gene regions. Two different genotypes within P. ilicis were detected. Pathogenicity of P. ilicis isolates was verified by inoculating freshly cut twigs of English holly. Phytophthora ilicis was originally recorded on English holly in western USA, and to date has been found only in cool temperate regions in northern America and, more recently, in Europe. This is the first report of P. ilicis on English holly in the Mediterranean region. Two additional Phytophthora species were isolated from other trees and shrubs species growing together with English holly, including P. bilorbang from Alnus glutinosa leaves and P. pseudosyringae from rhizosphere soil samples of A. glutinosa and Castanea sativa, and from symptomatic leaves of Hedera helix...|$|R
30|$|Phytophthora pluvialis is {{a member}} of Phytophthora Clade 3 (Cooke et al. [2000]). Other members of this clade (including Phytophthora nemorosa E. M. Hansen and Reeser, Phytophthora pseudosyringae T. Jung & Delatour, and Phytophthora ilicis Buddenhagen & R.A. Young) are {{typically}} associated with infection of leaves, shoots, and stems in north-western America (Buddenhagen and Young [1957]; Hansen et al. [2003]; Wickland et al. [2008]). To date, Phytophthora pluvialis has been isolated from environmental samples and has been rarely associated with <b>twig</b> and stem <b>cankers</b> on tanoak within forests of south-western Oregon where it is believed to be endemic (Reeser 2013). These forests are dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus (Hook. & Arn.) Rehder). Recovery of Phytophthora nemorosa, Phytophthora pseudosyringae, Phytophthora psychrophila T. Jung & E.M. Hansen and Phytophthora pluvialis in environmental canopy drip samples within these forests (Reeser et al. [2011]) is indicative of leaf and or needle infection by these species. However, no direct association between Phytophthora pluvialis and leaf/needle symptoms have been reported within Oregon forests. There have been no previous reports of red needle cast from the endemic range of Pinus radiata. This is the first report of Phytophthora pluvialis causing significant levels of disease and the first in exotic Pinus radiata plantations.|$|R
40|$|In 2007, {{symptoms}} of extensive branch and shoot dieback were observed on kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) shrubs and trees in some localities in the Messinia prefecture of south western Peloponnese, Greece. Symptoms were more intense during summer, with abundant dead branches and twigs having wilted leaves. On close examination, cankers were detected on the branches and <b>twigs</b> showing symptoms. <b>Cankers</b> were also evident on larger branches {{with no apparent}} foliar symptoms. In many of the branch samples taken, dark brown to black pycnidia were observed emerging through the bark on the canker surfaces. Fungal isolates from bark and wood tissues on symptom-bearing branches, {{as well as from}} spore masses in the pycnidia, were morphologically very similar and typical of species of the Botryosphaeriaceae. Colonies on malt extract agar (MEA) showed dense aerial mycelium that was initially white, gradually becoming dark grey olivaceous, with a radial growth rate of 1. 3 cm day− 1 at 25 °C. Conidiomata were formed on sterile poplar twigs placed on cultures grown on water agar and incubated under ultraviolet lights for three to 4 weeks. Conidia formed in culture and those from pycnidia on cankers were similar in shape and size: cylindrical with rounded ends, hyaline and unicellular, becoming light brown and two-celled with age, (20 -) 24 – 32 (- 38) × (10 -) 12 – 16 (- 17) μm...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Anisogramma anomala {{causes a}} stem canker of filberts, Corylus avellana. This disease became {{a threat to}} the main U. S. filbert growing region when it was {{introduced}} into the Pacific Northwest around 1968. Various methods of artificially inoculating filbert trees and seeds were explored. Less than 1 % of potted filbert trees inoculated with ascospores produced symptoms after 4 years. The disease was not transmitted following graft inoculation of orchard trees with infected tissue. Ascospores had no effect on germination or growth of Corylus seedlings. Spread of existing cankers was compared on the susceptible cultivar 'Daviana' and the more resistant cultivar 'Barcelona'. There was no significant difference (t=. 05) in canker elongation between cultivars, or between spread up and down the stems. Vertical elongation of perennial cankers averaged 26. 2 cm/year. Methods for storing ascospores prior to germination, and conditions for germinating ascospores were explored. Spores exhibited no loss of viability after 2 months when <b>cankered</b> <b>twigs</b> were stored below 0 ° C. Ascospores remained viable for less than 14 days following discharge in water. Drying was lethal to hydrated spores. Ascospores commenced germination 24 hours after hydration when placed on a suitable medium in a proper atmosphere. Germination occurred between 5 ° and 25 ° C, with an optimum of 20 °. Optimum pH for germination was between 4. 2 and 5. 7. A direct relationship was detected between ascospore concentration and percent germination. Eight antibiotics were screened in an attempt to prevent bacterial contamination. 10 ppm Rifampicin or 100 ppm Kanamycin effectively inhibited bacterial contaminants without affecting ascospore germination. Germination was compared on many different complex and defined media, and with different amendments added to the media. Various Corylus extracts had no effect on spore germination. 1 % ethanol and 5 % sucrose increased germination. Casamino acids, cornmeal or peptone promoted growth beyond the initial germ tube. Several stages of ascospore germination and early hyphal growth are described...|$|R
