The government also supports private sector participation in the sector.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, {{and for a}} canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.|$|E

5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} continued <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> freight {{operations on}} their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|As rail {{service and}} {{industry}} declined, Ayer made an awkward {{transition from a}} rail-centered town to a car-centered town. Both depots were demolished around 1960; the former northern depot and surrounding land was sold to a local business owner on September 29, 1960. The provisions of the sale and later transactions included deed restrictions requiring the purchaser to provide an easement for public station access {{as well as a}} station facility for 100 years. Service along the Fitchburg main line was cut back to Fitchburg that same year, leaving Fitchburg Line commuter service between Fitchburg and Boston as the sole remaining passenger service through Ayer when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was created in 1964 <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> suburban commuter services.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for {{his refusal to}} take the oath of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E

The first section describes how businesses benefit by offering time-limited job positions <b>to</b> <b>subsidized</b> workers. The second section describes how businesses benefit by hiring employment program graduates into unsubsidized positions. We encourage employment program providers, administrators, planners, and other workforce development stakeholders to use this brief to formulate effective "business cases" for why employers should offer employment opportunities <b>to</b> <b>subsidized</b> workers or hire program graduates into unsubsidized jobs...|$|R

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E
5000|$|Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), is a United States {{labor law}} case that {{came before the}} Supreme Court of the United States. At issue in the case was whether Abood v. Detroit Board of Education should be overruled, with public-sector [...] "agency shop" [...] {{arrangements}} invalidated under the First Amendment, and whether it violates the First Amendment to require that public employees affirmatively object <b>to</b> <b>subsidizing</b> nonchargeable speech by public-sector unions, rather than requiring employees to consent affirmatively <b>to</b> <b>subsidizing</b> such speech. Specifically, the case concerned public sector collective bargaining by the California Teachers Association, an affiliate of the National Education Association.|$|R
40|$|Many {{transitional}} jobs (TJ) or subsidized employment programs rely on {{a strong}} network of employer partners who offer time-limited employment opportunities <b>to</b> <b>subsidized</b> workers. <b>To</b> cultivate relationships with new employers and build a robust network of partners, TJ or subsidized employment program staff may need to show employers how their business will benefit by bringing on time-limited subsidized workers. This resource {{is an example of}} the kind of one-page handout that program providers can develop to give to potential employer partners to help make the business case for offering time-limited job positions <b>to</b> <b>subsidized</b> workers. This resource is intended for use as a template that program providers can reference in creating their own, program-specific document...|$|R
50|$|States {{generally}} charge higher tuition to out-of-state students.

5|$|The Gjøvik Line {{was chosen}} as the first service to be subject to PSO. The {{deadline}} for applying for prequalification was on 1 April 2004, and seven companies applied. These were Norges Statsbaner, Ofotbanen, Arriva, Veolia, Danske Statsbaner (DSB) and Keolis. The companies were required to document their competency to be qualified for security and operation permits from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate; and were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the operations from activities that were not subject to competition. To participate in the bid, NSB established the subsidiary NSB Anbud AS in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Władysław {{tried to}} regain the tsar's throne himself, {{organizing}} a campaign in 1616. Despite some military victories, {{he was unable to}} capture Moscow. The Commonwealth gained some disputed territories in the Truce of Deulino, but Władysław was never able to reign in Russia; the throne during this time was instead held by tsar Michael Romanov. He held on to the title, without any real power, until 1634. Likely, the failure of this campaign showed Władysław the limits of royal power in Poland, as major factors for the failure included significant autonomy of the military commanders, which did not see Władysław as their superior, and lack of funds for the army, as the Polish parliament (sejm) refused <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the war.|$|E
5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

5|$|In 1611, Henry Hudson {{was one of}} {{the first}} Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay, where he was {{abandoned}} by his crew. The first European to reach present-day central and southern Manitoba was Sir Thomas Button, who travelled upstream along the Nelson River to Lake Winnipeg in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson. When the British ship Nonsuch sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, she became the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company, to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed. This watershed was named Rupert's Land, after Prince Rupert, who helped <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the Hudson's Bay Company. York Factory was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Nelson (built in 1682), was destroyed by rival French traders.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E
5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary <b>to</b> <b>subsidize</b> basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} the Indonesian {{government}} subsidized rice program, RASKIN, were assessed in two rural villages in West Timor, eastern Indonesia, where traditionally the staple food is maize. The RASKIN program aims <b>to</b> make <b>subsidized</b> rice available <b>to</b> poor households, the allocation estimated to be a third of household requirements. All of the households interviewed bought subsidized rice {{when it was first}} available in this area in 2005, however about 30 % of households did not buy subsidized rice again, mainly because of a preference for maize over rice. Of the households that continued <b>to</b> buy <b>subsidized</b> rice, about half did not have enough cash <b>to</b> buy <b>subsidized</b> rice frequently, suggesting a targeting error of failure to benefit poor households. Households that bought subsidized rice consumed the rice with instant noodles and fewer nuts and beans (traditionally grown and eaten with maize), leading to a potentially lower nutrition intake. The practices of households selling their own produce, such as maize, beans and chickens, <b>to</b> purchase <b>subsidized</b> rice may constitute perverse outcomes, including future food shortages...|$|R
