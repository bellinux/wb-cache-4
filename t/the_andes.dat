5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than <b>the</b> <b>Andes.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} Army of <b>the</b> <b>Andes,</b> and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín.

All the leaders of the military units of the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Andes</b> play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while in much of the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid.

5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of <b>the</b> <b>Andes,</b> it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on the eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>Andes.</b> This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>Andes)</b> that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> (it builds over <b>the</b> <b>Andes).</b> Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses <b>the</b> <b>Andes.</b> At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of <b>the</b> <b>Andes,</b> air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) is {{a family}} of {{learning}} algorithms that range from low variance coupled with high bias through to high variance coupled with low bias. The asymptotic error of the lowest bias variant is the Bayes optimal. <b>The</b> <b>AnDE</b> family of algorithms have a training time that is linear {{with respect to the}} training examples, learn in a single pass through the data, support incremental learning, handle missing values directly and are robust in the face of noise. These characteristics make the algorithms particularly well suited to learning from large data. However, for higher orders of n they are very computationally demanding. This paper presents data structures and algorithms developed to reduce both memory and time for training and classification. These enhancements have enabled the evaluation and comparison of A 3 DE’s effectiveness. The results provide further support for the hypothesis that as the number of training examples increases, decreasing error will be attained by members of <b>the</b> <b>AnDE</b> family with increasing levels of n...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We review {{available}} data {{on drug use}} {{with respect to the}} spread of HIV/AIDS in South America and the Caribbean.
