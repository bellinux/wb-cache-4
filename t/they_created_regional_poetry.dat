25|$|With {{increasing}} migration, {{from the}} 1830s to the 1860s Missouri's population almost doubled with every decade. Most of the newcomers were American-born, but many Irish and German immigrants {{arrived in the}} late 1840s and 1850s. As a majority were Catholic, they {{set up their own}} religious institutions in the state, which had been mostly Protestant. Having fled famine and oppression in Ireland, and revolutionary upheaval in Germany, the immigrants were not sympathetic to slavery. Many settled in cities, where <b>they</b> <b>created</b> a <b>regional</b> and then state network of Catholic churches and schools. Nineteenth-century German immigrants created the wine industry along the Missouri River and the beer industry in St. Louis.|$|R
40|$|By {{virtue of}} their {{physical}} make-up, their cultural and linguistic diversity, and the relative isolation and spread of their population, Pacific Island countries {{are faced with a}} multitude of challenges in the delivery of information services. This article reviews the nature of the digital divides that exist in the Pacific region, considering divides within countries, between the countries, and between the Pacific region {{and the rest of the}} world. The varied but generally high costs of Internet access (in part brought about by national telecommunication monopolies) are exacerbating the digital divide along socio-economic lines; but <b>they</b> also <b>create</b> <b>regional</b> imbalances, with certain countries effectively isolated. Nonetheless, community-based systems can work to offset this, as shown on Niue. Within these countries at present, no structures are even envisaged that would address digital divides, nor the implications of the technologies on traditional rank, status and power structures, which are fundamental matters i...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{argue for a}} ‘horizontal’ {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} fair and ethical trade, one which asks questions about the wider eddies <b>they</b> <b>create</b> within <b>regional</b> production contexts. This approach runs counter to much of the existing literature on the topic, which typically examines initiatives ‘vertically’, in terms of how they affect the lives of participating producers and communities. Applying this method to critique fair and ethical trade in the tea and coffee plantation districts of South India, we find that, at present, initiatives fail to intersect with the most pressing problems of poverty and development within this regional production system. Somewhat ironically, these schemes seem to be having their greatest positive effects within industry segments that are not the most needful of support, and tend to have very limited engagement with those industry participants in direst straits (notably, smallholders and workers on abandoned estates). Consideration of these issues highlights how the uneven penetration of fair and ethical trade is contributing to transformations in the institutional formations and systems of governance. Producers oriented to servicing affluent Western markets are increasingly enmeshed within fair and ethical trade agendas and interact with dense ensembles of suprastate and civil society regulation (involving international nongovernmental organisations and audit firms). Yet, more marginalised producers remain regulated by traditional institutional mechanisms embedded within the nation-state (government departments, trade unions, etc). These assessments point to the limitations and challenges facing fair and ethical trade as a strategic intervention for addressing the social, economic, and environmental injustices of global agriculture. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of {{regionalization}} and regional identity in the endeavours of emerging economies to connect successfully to the global world economy. It addresses {{the question of whether}} the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with its loose institutional integration framework, has contributed to the global integration of its very heterogenous members in the first decade of the 21 st century – and, if so, what are the drivers behind this. The paper summarizes connecting theories, using a multidisciplinary approach, and uses descriptive statistical analysis to identify the achievements of the ASEAN- 6 countries within global trade and foreign direct invesment (FDI) flows in the given time period. We suggest that ASEAN countries, with their efforts to initiate interconnecting regional organizations in Asia, most specifically the ASEAN+ 3 (APT) construction, did contribute to greater integratedness of member countries; and <b>they</b> have <b>created</b> a <b>regional</b> image with a common market and production base. Such achievements, however, can be in great part attributed to the micro-level activities of international and regional firms wishing to establish cross-border production networks in these countries...|$|R

40|$|The Duke of Devonshire was a {{traditional}} landed aristocrat, who owned, {{according to the}} 'New Doomsday Book' of 1873, the seventh largest land, out of which he gained the second largest gross rental in the English landed aristocracy. He formed its central core. William Cavendish (1808 - 1884), who inherited the Dukedom in 1858, has been taken as a classic Mid-Victorian improving landlord. His entrepreneurship mainly covered the industrialisation and urbanisation of Barrow-in-Furness. In 1846 he constructed the Furness Railway {{as a means of}} developing his own iron mines, in the 1860 's created the Barrow Haematite Steel Co. Ltd. and in the early 1870 's a group of firms, which were related to the export of the steel rail. The firms respectively worked as elements which composed the productive forces for the use of landnature, and as a whole <b>they</b> <b>created</b> a <b>regional</b> structure of productive forces for the use of natural resources. The Cavendishes completely grasped these firms, at first as 'a proprietary railway', next as a 'Furness Railway-Cavendish organism', and lastly as the 'Furness Railway's Industrial Empire'. It was made possible owing to the prosperity of England as World Factory that the landowner transformed his own wealth into the capital on a large scale, led by the interest of his estate management. This was the process of forming a 'Capital-Landownership Complex' proper to Modern England, in which on one hand the landowner partly came to base on the capital, {{and on the other hand}} English Capitalism mobilized the wealth ofthe landowner to the capital. The aim of this paper is to study the Duke of Devonshire's finance which supported the aggressive estate management. It brings light on the followings; 1. the 6 th Duke's Finance in the 1850 's, through the close study of the Chief Agent's General Statements of Income and Expenditure, 2. the state of the Duke Family's finance on the 7 th Duke's succession to the Dukedom, through the careful examination of his the letters and diary, 3. his estate management and its finance between 1858 and 1884, through the analysis ofthe summary statement...|$|R
