The battle system uses many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the touchscreen or by shouting into the microphone.

The transgene must contain a promoter, which is a regulatory sequence <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> where and when the transgene is active, an exon, a protein coding sequence (usually derived from the cDNA for the protein of interest), and a stop sequence. These are typically combined in a bacterial plasmid and the coding sequences are typically chosen from transgenes with previously known functions.|$|E

The {{most important of these}} is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 6th class when {{students}} are 13, students take a compulsory exam <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> their acceptance and transition into a specific lower secondary school (gimnazjum, pronounced gheem-nah-sium) (Middle School/Junior High). They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a liceum or four years in a technikum. Both end with a maturity examination (matura—similar to French baccalauréat), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to licencjat or inżynier (the Polish Bologna Process first cycle qualification), magister (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification).|$|E

Harper then said that he would take a pro-Israeli stance, no matter what the political cost to Canada. Ignatieff criticized Harper's stance as a [...] "mistake", saying Canada would be better able to defend Israel through the Security Council than from the sidelines and pointed out that it is the Security Council <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> if sanctions are imposed on Iran. Ignatieff also accused Harper of steering the discussion away from implementing the two-state solution, and instead rendering all discussion into a competition [...] "about who is Israel's best friend".|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} a new field of gaming called Neurogaming, which uses {{non-invasive}} BCI in order to improve gameplay so that users can interact with a console without the use of a traditional controller.

For example, game developers at Emotiv have created non-invasive BCI <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> the mood of a player and adjust music or scenery accordingly. This new form of interaction between player and software will enable a player to have a more realistic gaming experience.

2500|$|Imagine {{that the}} {{superposition}} {{of a state}} that can be mentally labeled as blue and another state that can be mentally labeled as red will then appear (in imagination, of course) as a purple state. Two photons are produced {{as the result of}} the same atomic event. Perhaps they are produced by the excitation of a crystal that characteristically absorbs a photon of a certain frequency and emits two photons of half the original frequency. So the two photons come out [...] "purple." [...] If the experimenter now performs some experiment <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> whether one of the photons is either blue or red, then that experiment changes the photon involved from one having a superposition of [...] "blue" [...] and [...] "red" [...] characteristics to a photon that has only one of those characteristics. The problem that Einstein had with such an imagined situation was that if one of these photons had been kept bouncing between mirrors in a laboratory on earth, and the other one had traveled halfway to the nearest star, when its twin was made to reveal itself as either blue or red, that meant that the distant photon now had to lose its [...] "purple" [...] status too. So whenever it might be investigated after its twin had been measured, it would necessarily show up in the opposite state to whatever its twin had revealed.|$|E
2500|$|Although Shanghai and Hong Kong {{regularly}} perform highly {{in international}} assessments, Chinese education has both native and international detractors; common areas of criticism include its rigor; {{its emphasis on}} memorization and standardized testing; and the gap in quality of education between students of rural and urban areas. Jonathan Kaiman of The Guardian writes that Chinese parents and educators [...] "see their own system as corrupt, dehumanising, pressurised and unfair"; {{he went on to}} discuss the country's college admission exam (called the gaokao), writing that [...] "many parents consider the gruelling nine-hour test a sorting mechanism <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> the trajectory of their children's lives." [...] In The New York Times, Helen Gao called China's educational system [...] "cutthroat" [...] and wrote that its positive reputation among admirers is largely built on a myth: While China has phenomenally expanded basic education for its people, quadrupling its output of college graduates in the past decade, it has also created a system that discriminates against its less wealthy and well-connected citizens, thwarting social mobility at every step with bureaucratic and financial barriers. A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities {{is one of the main}} culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are [...] "shortchanged" [...] in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.|$|E

When I sit upon the bench, a respectable magistrate, and commit some battered reprobate for trial for this lurid offence or that, or send him or her to prison for drunkenness or such-like indecorum, the doubt drifts into my mind which of us after all is indeed getting nearest to the keen edge of life.

With high passion in his voice, and mastering gesture in his uplifted arm, he dashed impetuously upon the foe. What weighs upon my mind is this, he said, that when the future historian speaks of the greatness of this empire, and traces the manner in which it has grown through successive generations, he will say that in that history there was one chapter of disgrace, and that chapter of disgrace was the treatment of Ireland. It is the scale of justice <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> the issue of the conflict with Ireland, if conflict there is to be. There is nothing we can do, cried the orator, (M53) turning to the Irish members, except the imprudence of placing in your hands evidence that will show that we are not acting on principles of justice towards you, that can render you for a moment formidable in our eyes, should the day unfortunately arise when you endeavour to lay hands on this great structure of the British empire. Let us be as strong in right as we are in population, in wealth, and in historic traditions, and then we shall not fear to do justice to Ireland. There is but one mode of making England weak in the face of Ireland—that is by applying to her principles of inequality and principles of injustice.|$|E
