5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of alprazolam.|$|E

5|$|Global {{sales of}} Lexus {{vehicles}} reached {{an all-time high}} in 2007, {{with a total of}} 518,000.

5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at risk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy right whale). Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E

5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Altair, a £100million {{development}} on Oakfield Road, {{is expected to}} begin in 2013. The scheme includes a hotel, offices, shops and eating places, and is expected to create 2,000permanent jobs. A further £20million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby Altrincham Interchange. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, {{nearly a third of the}} shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of the recession and plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E
