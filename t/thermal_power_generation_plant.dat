40|$|The article unveils {{the mystery}} of cogeneration. Cogeneration is an add-on or {{embedded}} activity in thermal power plants, with as merit the use of part or whole of their point source heat exhausts. EU's talk of “high-efficiency cogeneration” is an unfounded transfer of responsibility from the hosting <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plant</b> onto CHP (Combined Heat & Power) activity. The quality of a CHP activity is univocally defined by its design power-to-heat ratio σ, a tombstone parameter derived from the design characteristics of the power plant. A thermal power plant may house more than one cogeneration activity. Identifying σ requires positioning the bliss point in the electricity–heat production possibility set of the cogeneration activity. The bliss point is where after electric output is maximized, the sum of that output and the maximum recoverable quantity of heat occurs. Once CHP's mystery of virtual bliss points is unveiled, the proper σ are found. With known σ by CHP activity, the quantity of cogenerated electricity is reliably assessed as best indicator of cogeneration performance. Our analysis is applicable on all relevant thermal power cycles that host CHP activities, and illustrated with a numerical example. Our lean method is necessary and sufficient for proper CHP regulation. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This will take care of economical and environment factors to gather with concrete life cycle analysis. Fly as {{is one of the}} major by product of coal fired <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plant.</b> Production of fly ash in Indian context is of order 132 million tone annually; against which the utilization is of order 42 % in all possible area of application. High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete is one of the important area for large scale utilization of pulverized coal ash as concrete is most widely use material on earth after water. Use of fly ash in concrete will address the all issues of sustainability by less utilization of cement the principal binder a major source of green house gas contribution, durability aspect due to its pozzolanic property and less consumption of virgin material. Though use of High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete is proven technology since last two decade the use is till date is not wide spread due to specific limitations like early slower strength gain, poor resistance to flexural, abrasive and impact loading. Authors in this article will present the experimental work to study on effect of polyester fibre in improvement of Impact and Abrasion resistance of HVFA concrete.

40|$|The {{unexpected}} failures, {{the down}} time (outage) {{associated with such}} failures, the loss of production of power and, the higher maintenance costs are major problems in operation of thermal power plants. The unexpected failure of an equipments and systems causes economic risk and can be minimized using an effective maintenance strategy. The risk based approach ensures a strategy, which is cost effective. Such an approach uses the information obtained {{from the study of}} failure modes and their consequences. [...] The purpose of the thesis is to develop and show how to implement a risk based maintenance (RBM) policy to a power plant. This quantitative approach will provide a basis for selection of the best alternative strategy to minimize the risk resulting from breakdowns or failures. [...] The proposed methodology is comprised of three modules: risk assessment, risk evaluation, and maintenance planning. This work presents a mechanism {{for the study of the}} occurrence of failures and functional failures in equipment and the severity of their consequences, known as risk. Maintenance of equipment is prioritized based on the risk, and the reduction in overall risk of the plant is accomplished by focusing on the maintenance of high-risk items first. To the author's knowledge this quantitative approach has not been developed before. [...] The study is conducted for Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, Holyrood <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plant.</b> Failure data is collected from the existing power station (Unit 3 - 150 MW) over a period of twelve years. The data is modeled using Weibull and Exponential distributions to estimate the parameters. A probabilistic risk analysis is performed to quantify the risk at the plant. An acceptable risk criterion is determined and the major systems and subsystems that are found to have a risk higher than acceptable risk are identified. The maintenance interval is calculated by reverse or target probability analysis for reducing the level or risk resulting from the failure of a system. [...] To conclude, the risk based maintenance strategy can be employed to prioritize the systems for maintenance planning, and to improve the existing maintenance policies. In addition, this strategy provides cost-effective means for maintenance as well it minimizes the consequences (safety, economic and environment) related to a system failure...|$|E

In addition, an analysis of Cost - Benefit of investments to the electricity generation using fossil fuel and bagasse is done. The Methodology EX-Ante Carbon-balance Tool (EX-ACT) was used; this methodology was proposed by the United Nations Organization for Food and Agriculture (FAO) to determine the overall greenhouse gases (GHG) emission balance. Additionally, the WinDASI program, also developed by FAO, was used for the Cost - Benefit Analysis of investment in power plants. Furthermore, we performed marginal costing GHG reduction. The results show, that all plants are sources of GHG emissions, however the impact of sugar mills is partially positive by reforestation components and annual crops. However, the component inputs had negative environmental and socially impact. In the case of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants</b> based on petroleum {{connected to the}} national grid, they were found to be sources of greenhouse gases.

40|$|A major setback in {{standard}} generic energy modelling is that national conditions constitute {{the basis for}} analysis. By such an approach, heat and energy assets, demands, and distribution structures are viewed from an aggregated perspective not permitting insight into unique local circumstances and conditions. As a consequence, genuinely local synergy opportunities, e. g. recovery and utilisation of excess heat from various activities and sources by distribution in district heating systems, are often ignored or overlooked in generic forecasts. The ambitious European targets to increase energy efficiency in future power and heat distribution and use acts as a force to address local conditions in a more systematic and thorough sense than previously elaborated. Increased utilisation of local heat assets and recovered excess heat from local activities, to provide space and tap water heating in residential and service sectors, can replace and thus substitute large shares of natural gas and electricity currently being used to satisfy low temperature heat demands. Spatial screening and identification of local conditions throughout Europe, by use of NUTS 3 regions as analytical level of reference, can disclose favourable synergy regions by combining information on local heat assets and demands, and hence provide additional and pivotal information to energy modellers. In this study, local conditions such as excess heat from <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants,</b> Waste-to-Energy incineration facilities, energy intensive industrial processes, and renewable heat assets (geothermal and solar), are depicted together with heat demand concentrations, using GIS based spatial information, to visualise the possibilities of mapping local European heat resources...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid heating source using biomass-derived syngas is {{proposed}} to enable continuous operation of standalone solar <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants.</b> A novel, two-stage, low temperature combustion system {{is proposed}} {{that has the}} potential to provide stable combustion of syngas with near-zero NO emissions. The hybrid heating system consists of a downdraft gasifier, a two-stage combustion system, and other auxiliaries. When integrated with a solar cycle, the entire system can be referred to as the integrated gasification solar combined cycle (IGSCC). The supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle (SCO 2) is selected for the solar cycle due to its high efficiency. The thermodynamic performance evaluation of the individual unit and the combined system has been conducted from both energy and exergy considerations. The effect of parameters such as gasification temperature, biomass moisture content, equivalence ratio, and pressure ratio is studied. The efficiency of the IGSCC exhibited a non-monotonic behavior. A maximum thermal efficiency of 36. 5 % was achieved at an overall equivalence ratio of 0. 22 and pressure ratio of 2. 75 when the gasifier was operating at T-g = 1073 K with biomass containing 20 % moisture. The efficiency increased to 40. 8 % when dry biomass was gasified at a temperature of 973 K. The exergy analysis revealed that the maximum exergy destruction occurred in the gasification system, followed by the combustion system, SCO 2 cycle, and regenerator. The exergy analysis also showed that 8. 72 % of the total exergy is lost in the exhaust; however, this can be utilized for drying of the biomass. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Lately global warming has received a lot of attention, in Sudan; Part of this attention has fallen upon the energy end-use sector and the role it plays in generating greenhouse gases. The main objective of this Study is to illustrate the electricity consumer behavior which accelerates the greenhouse gas emissions growth by increasing energy consumption, and to formulate recommendations to control the GHG emission. The greenhouse gases emission from <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants</b> was evaluated based on different types of fuels. The residential sector was selected as an indicator since the electrical consumption of this sector represent more than 47 % of the total power consumption, further more the consumer behavior of this sector represents to some extent, other sectors. Questionnaire had been prepared and distributed among random sample of 50 householders with different social categories; this Questionnaire was then subjected to data analysis. It was been extracted from the results that the growth rate of GHG which emitted from <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant would increase in 2014 by a factor of 4. 5 relative to that of 2000. More than 25 % of the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions attributed by the residential sector is the result of energy “lost” by the users' behavior and used old technology. The acceptance of the society to have a role in the reduction of electrical consumption is very low due to their poor awareness of the sequence their behavior and the benefit they are going to gain, if they respond positively. The study has formulated recommendations for mitigations, which include mainly: Implementation of new technologies related to all energy end-users activities, escalating energy conservation awareness of the different social categories, in other way improving the efficiency of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants to decrease the pollution...|$|R

An economic comparison was then made between overall indirect-fired air preheat designs, and overall direct-fired designs.

40|$|Economical and {{ecological}} considerations {{with respect to}} the need for reduction of CO 2 emission and fuel consumption in conventional steam power plants are leading to the requirement for the utilities to increase the <b>thermal</b> efficiency of <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plant.</b> A number of high strength 9 - 12 % Cr steels have been developed for applications as construction materials in such advanced power plants. Besides mechanical properties, the oxidation resistance of these new steels is becoming an increasingly important material selection criterion. In the present work, the oxidation behaviour of several of the new 9 - 12 wt. % Cr steels in environments containing water vapour, mainly Ar- 50 vol. % H 2 O has been studied especially at temperatures between 550 and 650 °C. The results of the oxidation tests clearly indicate that the oxygen coming from the water vapour is incorporated in the oxide scale in a different way as the oxygen originating from the O 2 molecule. A typical feature of 9 - 12 % Cr-steels is the bell-shaped temperature dependence of the oxidation rates in water vapour, i. e. at 550 and especially at 800 °C the oxidation rates are much lower than at 600 to 650 °C. For the enhanced oxidation rates of the 9 - 12 chromium steels in environments containing water vapour a mechanism is proposed which involves the evaporation of volatile iron hydroxide. Tests with simple model steels have shown that additions of cobalt may provide significant improvement in the steam oxidation behaviour of the studied steels...|$|R
40|$|A {{modeling}} tool {{has been developed}} {{which can be used}} to analyze interaction between intermittent wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> <b>generation</b> in a regional electricity grid system. The model uses a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach to determine the power plant dispatch strategy which yields the lowest systems costs. In the model, each large thermal plant is described separately, including properties such as start-up time, start-up cost and minimum load level. The model is evaluated using western Denmark as a case study. For western Denmark, it is found that the inclusion of start-up performance (i. e. start-up time and related costs) and minimum load level of the power generating units {{have a significant impact on}} the results. It is shown that the inclusion of these aspects influences the analysis of the effect of wind power variations on the production patterns of thermal units in the system. The model demonstrates how the introduction of wind power production and associated variations change the dispatch order of the large <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants in the western Denmark system so that the unit with the lowest running costs no longer has the highest capacity factor. It is shown that this effect only is detected if start-up performance and minimum load level limitations are included in the optimization. it can also be concluded that start-up performance and minimum load level must be taken into account if the total system costs and emissions are not to be underestimated. The simulations show that if these aspects are disregarded, both total costs and total emissions of the power system are underestimated, with 5 % in the case of western Denmark. Models such as the one developed in this work can be efficient tools to understand the effects of large-scale wind power integration in a <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> system with base load plants...|$|R
