5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the classification difficult in individual cases. All types have partial forms. For instance, some people experience only isolated eye-movement or coordination problems; these {{are thought to be}} a subtype of Miller Fisher syndrome and have similar antiganglioside antibody patterns.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of viscosity, the {{cross-section}} of a wind tunnel is typically circular rather than square, because there will be greater flow constriction in the corners of a square tunnel <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the flow turbulent.

25|$|Air {{conditioning}} and heating in buildings and motor vehicles {{are two of}} the largest applications for heat exchangers. While copper tube is used in most air {{conditioning and}} refrigeration systems, typical air conditioning units currently use aluminium fins. These systems can harbor bacteria and mold and develop odors and fouling <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> them function poorly. Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern HVAC systems.|$|E

Captured CO2 from the waste exhaust flue gases will be injected into circulating waste water to grow oil-rich algae where sunlight and nutrients will produce heavy oil-laden slurry <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> high grade oil for energy, or stock feed.

25|$|Group {{psychological}} abuse refers to groups where methods of {{psychological abuse}} are frequently or systematically used on their members.

25|$|There {{is little}} arable land in Boho {{and this is}} usually set aside for {{domestic}} use. Due to low farming income, there are few people <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a living as full-time farmers in the area, rather there {{is a mixture of}} people who derive some income from faming {{but for the most part}} their main incomes derive from other sources. The positive side to this low intensity agriculture system is that Boho still retains a high diversity of environmentally important species that are in decline on a national scale found in species rich hay meadows, pastures and semi-natural habitats.|$|E
25|$|Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is {{a native}} {{interface}} that is accessed through a programming language (usually C) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> calls into a native library. In MDAC this interface {{is defined as a}} DLL. A separate module or driver is needed for each database that must be accessed. The functions in the ODBC API are implemented by these DBMS-specific drivers. The driver that Microsoft provides in MDAC is called the SQL Server ODBC Driver (SQLODBC), and (as the name implies) is designed for Microsoft's SQL Server. It supports SQL Server v6.5 and upwards. ODBC allows programs to use SQL requests that will access databases without having to know the proprietary interfaces to the databases. It handles the SQL request and converts it into a request that the individual database system understands.|$|E
25|$|The AMA is {{composed}} of various internal groups that discuss policy twice a year. There is an annual meeting, always held in Chicago, IL and an Interim meeting set on a rotating schedule for different locations. Within the AMA, there are sections <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> up the total AMA. These sections include Medical Students, Resident and Fellows, Academic physicians, Medical School Deans and Faculty, Physicians in group practice setting, Retired and Senior Physicians, International Medical graduates, Woman physicians, Physician Diversity and Minority health, GLBT, USAN, AMA board of Trustees, Foundation and Council. Externally to the AMA, there are organizations that come to these meetings by sending representatives. These representatives meet two {{a year in the}} House of Delegates at the Interim and/or annual meeting. Representatives come from medical societies that are either from a state, specialty or the federal services/government services. These organizations are called AMA member organizations.|$|E
