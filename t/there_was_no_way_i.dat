500|$|Ferguson remarked the Shield {{should not}} have been settled on penalties; to him it was a [...] "celebration of success", though {{ultimately}} he was delighted his team won. He was pleased with the team's start – [...] "I thought in the first 25 minutes we were really good and could have tied the match up then" [...] – and considered lining the team up in a 4–3–3 formation to begin with, though wanted to see [...] "how Keane played with Ince, what the balance was like". Ince believed he should have been awarded a penalty after Jensen fouled him: [...] "I was past their last man and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would have dived from there." ...|$|E

With [...] remaining, Froome attacked to win the stage by a margin of seventeen seconds. Van Garderen moved into the lead of the general classification, and although placing second in the stage, he was content, saying [...] "My tactic was just to mark Froome and when he went <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could follow him, but I'm very happy with the yellow jersey." ...|$|E

Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was ever going to learn to surf – no way!

[...] Four days later Ledley was sent off {{for the first time}} in his career when he was red carded for a {{challenge}} on Hearts midfielder Ian Black during a 0–2 defeat at Tynecastle. [...] Ledley publicly defended himself, stating [...] "I couldn’t believe it when the ref sent me off. I thought it was a fair challenge", and added “I spoke to Ian [...] after it and even he told me I got the ball – <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> went in to intentionally hurt anyone."

2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1976, he {{auditioned for}} Iron Maiden, {{eager to get}} back into [...] "a more sort of heavy rock-type vibe." [...] at the time, the band already had two guitarists, Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance, who disapproved of Murray's admittance, seeing it as a slight on their ability. The group's founder and bassist Steve Harris did not {{hesitate}} in choosing Murray over Sullivan and Rance, stating, [...] "When the others made it plain that it was either them or Dave Murray, there was no choice. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was gonna let Dave go. Not only was he a nice bloke, he was just the best guitarist I'd ever worked with. He still is." [...] Unfortunately, after only a few months in the band, Murray was sacked following an argument with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock after a show at the Bridgehouse pub in Canning Town which led him to team up with Adrian Smith again in his band, Urchin. During his short tenure with this group, Murray recorded one single, entitled [...] "She's A Roller", after which he was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden following Dennis Wilcock's departure.|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E

[...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E

Fortune favoured me, and we met in the woodland, and I saw that she was still beautiful and knew that I loved her more than ever before.

We were brought up together in the same country place. We were both thrown upon the world about the same time. That was one thing, I suppose, which made us kindly disposed towards one another. We corresponded always. I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London. I lived--I can't tell you how--week by week, month by month. I ate coarse food, I was a hanger-on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me, fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries. I met no one of my own station--I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk--or tastes. I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself, no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows, no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with--and I wasn't always the gloomy sort of person I have become; in my younger days I loved companionship. And the women--my landlady's daughter, with dyed hair, a loud voice, slatternly in the morning, a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night! Who else? Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men? I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna. Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together. We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes. She was a teacher at the national school. The children weren't pleasant, their parents were worse. The drudgery was horrible, and there wasn't any escape for her. Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side. She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us. I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery. We talked endlessly of a way out. For me what was there? There was no one to rob--I wasn't clever enough. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could earn money, honestly or dishonestly. And for her, buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries, where there was scarcely a person who hadn't the taint of the place upon them--what chance was there for her? There was nothing she could do, either. I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape. And we couldn't. So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we. We read poetry. We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes. It was a morbid, unhealthy existence, but I plodded along and so did she. Then her weekly letters became different. For the first time she wrote me with reserves. I took a day's vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened." ...|$|E
