5000|$|I {{tried to}} persuade myself that I was <b>three-quarters</b> <b>normal</b> and that {{only a quarter of}} me was queerâ€”whereas really it was the other way around. W. Somerset Maugham ...|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor plan}} {{is typical of}} an Adam Federalist house, with a center hall and two symmetrical rooms on either side. The third (or attic) floor consisted of a secondary suite, with kitchenette and full bathroom. Over the kitchen addition were two floors, each only <b>three-quarters</b> <b>normal</b> height. A narrow, spiral servants' stairs provides access to a bedroom and full bath on each floor above.|$|E
25|$|In mild renal impairment, {{no change}} {{needs to be}} made in dosing any of the other drugs {{routinely}} used in the treatment of TB. In severe renal insufficiency (GFR<30), the EMB dose should be halved (or avoided altogether). The PZA dose is 20nbsp&mg/kg/day (UK recommendation) or <b>three-quarters</b> the <b>normal</b> dose (US recommendation), but not much published evidence is available to support this.|$|R
50|$|The open-top sub-type {{is sealed}} by a {{mechanical}} ring clamp (concave inwards) that exerts sufficient pressure to hold many non-volatile liquids {{and make an}} airtight seal against a gasket, as it exerts force inward and downward when tightened by a <b>normal</b> <b>three-quarter</b> inch wrench or ratchet wrench. Tops exist with bung holes as above, and these hybrid drums with lid {{can be used to}} ship many non-volatile liquids as well as industrial powders. Many drums are used to ship and store powdered products as well as liquids, such as plastic beads for injection moulding, extrusion, and purified industrial grade powders like cleansers (e.g., fertilizers, and powdered aluminum). If used to transport dangerous goods across international boundaries, they may need to have UN certification. In general, drum usage is limited to wholesale distribution of bulk products, which are then further processed or sub-divided in a factory.|$|R
