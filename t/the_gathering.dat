40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> problem of mobile agents in asynchronous unidirectional rings equipped with whiteboards on nodes. <b>The</b> partial <b>gathering</b> {{problem is a}} new generalization of <b>the</b> total <b>gathering</b> problem. <b>The</b> partial <b>gathering</b> problem requires, for a given integer g, that each agent should move to a node and terminate so that at least g agents should meet at the same node. The requirement for <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> problem is weaker than that for <b>the</b> (well-investigated) total <b>gathering</b> problem, and thus, we have interests in clarifying the difference on the move complexity between them. We propose three algorithms to solve <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> problem. <b>The</b> first algorithm is deterministic but requires unique ID of each agent. This algorithm achieves <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> in O(gn) total moves, where n {{is the number of}} nodes. The second algorithm is randomized and requires no unique ID of each agent (i. e., anonymous). This algorithm achieves <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> in expected O(gn) total moves. The third algorithm is deterministic and requires no unique ID of each agent. For this case, we show that there exist initial configurations in which no algorithm can solve the problem and agents can achieve <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> in O(kn) total moves for solvable initial configurations, where k is the number of agents. Note that <b>the</b> total <b>gathering</b> problem requires Ω(kn) total moves, while <b>the</b> partial <b>gathering</b> problem requires Ω(gn) total moves in each model. Hence, we show that the move complexity of the first and second algorithms is asymptotically optimal...|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning {{different aspects of}} Magic: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering.</b> One example examined how players use their imaginations when playing.

Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using {{a specific set of}} cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> to be Turing complete.|$|E

5|$|An online version, Black & White: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering,</b> was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light, but when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> Storm, Towers of Midnight, and A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{specifically}} address the religious dimensions of <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Gatherings.</b> <b>The</b> fundamental question directing this analysis is: 2 ̆ 2 Are <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Gatherings</b> religious in character? 2 ̆ 2 This thesis specifically asks whether or not <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Gatherings</b> satisfy certain identifiable features of religion, and if doing so, do they qualify {{as a form of}} religion? I engage this question by analyzing <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Gatherings</b> in terms of two particular definitions of religion: Clifford Geertz 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 functional 2 ̆ 2 definition and Bryan R. Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 substantive 2 ̆ 2 definition. This allows me to analyze <b>the</b> Rainbow <b>Gatherings</b> from <b>the</b> perspective of the two major approaches to defining religion. This thesis also explores the broader differences and implications of these two types of definitions in academia, as well as the significance this has for future studies of this sort. Conclusive results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>Gatherings</b> conform to both definitions in some ways, but not in others. The results also designate which of the two definitions <b>the</b> <b>Gatherings</b> satisfy more inclusively. Thus, this analysis not only examines whether or not these gatherings qualify as a form of religion, but also examines how these definitions of religion illuminate features of the Rainbow Gathering, and how this relates to the scholarly distinction of these two types of definitions...|$|R
