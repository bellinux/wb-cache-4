5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered {{out of the air}} raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E

25|$|The PCI bus {{requires}} {{that every time}} the device driving a PCI bus signal changes, one turnaround cycle must elapse between the time the one device stops driving the signal and the other device starts.

25|$|The human BOK {{promoter}} {{is activated}} by the overexpression {{of members of}} the E2F hand transcription factor family. Typically, these transcription factors are involved in the promotion of S-phase, so <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> connection between Bok expression and cell cycle progression. Due to this regulation of Bok expression by the cell cycle, it was proposed that Bok sensitizes growing cells to stress-induced apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly the {{character}} of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind.

25|$|Subscription publishing: {{pioneered by}} the English {{in the early}} 17th century. A {{prospectus}} for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who {{signed up for a}} copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.|$|E
25|$|The alt.* {{hierarchy}} is {{not subject}} to the procedures controlling groups in the Big Eight, and it is as a result less organized. Groups in the alt.* hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific—for example, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> newsgroup under the Big Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. Binaries are posted in alt.binaries.*, making it the largest of all the hierarchies.|$|E

25|$|Frankel was {{expected}} to have only one more race in his career, and to stand as a stallion from 2013. Having demonstrated at York his ability comfortably to stay ten furlongs, there was speculation that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> change to his programme, with his final race being the twelve furlong (mile and a half) Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. However, on 31 August Lord Grimthorpe said that Frankel's next race would be the Champion Stakes.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} issue of {{population}} growth. The population of Russia has been declining rapidly in the 1990s and only recently did the Russian government predict the population to stabilize and grow in 2020. Brazil's and China's populations will begin to decline in several decades, with their demographic windows closing in several decades as well. This may have implications for those countries' future, for <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> decrease in the overall labor force and a negative change {{in the proportion of}} workers to retirees.|$|E
25|$|Helium-4 is {{a liquid}} at normal {{pressure}} near absolute zero, {{a consequence of}} its high zero-point energy (ZPE). The ZPE of protons in a dense state is also high, {{and a decline in}} the ordering energy (relative to the ZPE) is expected at high pressures. Arguments have been advanced by Neil Ashcroft and others that there is a melting point maximum in compressed hydrogen, but also that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> range of densities, at pressures around , where hydrogen would be a liquid metal, even at low temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Nobiin has {{open and}} closed {{syllable}}s: ág ‘mouth’, één ‘woman’, gíí ‘uncle’, kám ‘camel’, díís ‘blood’. Every syllable bears a tone. Long consonants are only found in intervocalic position, whereas long vowels {{can occur in}} initial, medial and final position. Phonotactically, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> weak relationship between the occurrence of consonant and vowel length: forms like dàrrìl 'climb' and dààrìl 'be present' are found, but *dàrìl (short V + short C) and *dààrrìl (long V + long C) do not exist; similarly, féyyìr 'grow' and fééyìr 'lose (a battle)' occur, but not *féyìr and *fééyyìr.|$|E
25|$|A {{major step}} {{has been the}} government's {{promotion}} of NGOs, which are a new concept in China. Many of the larger domestic groups are actually government funded, and those not affiliated with the government are required {{to go through a}} complicated registration procedure to be officially endorsed, although <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> relaxation of these policies in the future. The presence of international NGOs is also increasing. The ability of NGOs to work with high-risk groups, especially those that engage in behaviors deemed to be illegal or immoral, and to provide care and outreach where overstretched health services cannot, is recognized. The private sector is also being encouraged to undertake prevention and education activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is often}} {{separated from the}} body of the church by railings and screens, and, in the case of Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, by an iconostasis which forms a complete visual as well as physical barrier. The sanctuary is usually the most ornately decorated part of a church, creating a visual focus towards the altar. This might be done in several ways. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> carved or painted altarpiece, a large carved screen called a reredos, or a structure called a ciborium which form a canopy over the altar. In English churches that have a square eastern end, a very large stained glass window often fills the wall behind the altar.|$|E
