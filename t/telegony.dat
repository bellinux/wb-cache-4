5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated <b>telegony,</b> offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Individual quaggas {{were also}} {{captured}} {{and shipped to}} Europe, where they were displayed in zoos. Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on <b>telegony,</b> referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{places in}} Italy and {{northern}} Greece also had aetiological legends about cities {{and other institutions}} founded by Odysseus on his various travels. Among these foundation myths the continuation of Odysseus's travels told in the <b>Telegony</b> {{is at least as}} important as the wanderings reported in the Odyssey.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Telegony</b> {{picks up}} where the Odyssey leaves off, {{beginning}} with the burial of the dead suitors, and continues until the death of Odysseus. Some years after Odysseus' return, Telegonus, the son of Odysseus and Circe, came to Ithaca and plundered the island. Odysseus, attempting to fight off the attack, was killed by his unrecognized son. After Telegonus realized he had killed his father, he brought the body to his mother Circe, along with Telemachus and Penelope. Circe made them immortal; then Telegonus married Penelope and Telemachus married Circe.|$|E
25|$|Other {{parts of}} the Trojan War were told in the poems of the Epic Cycle, {{also known as the}} Cyclic Epics: the Cypria, Aethiopis, Little Iliad, Iliou Persis, Nostoi, and <b>Telegony.</b> Though these poems survive only in fragments, their content is known from a summary {{included}} in Proclus' Chrestomathy. The authorship of the Cyclic Epics is uncertain. It is generally thought that the poems were written down in the 7th and 6th century BC, after the composition of the Homeric poems, though it is widely believed that they were based on earlier traditions.|$|E
500|$|Over time, the Bedouin {{developed}} several sub-types or {{strains of}} Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics, and traced through the maternal line only. According to the Arabian Horse Association, the five primary strains {{were known as}} the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan, Hamdani and Hadban. Carl Raswan, a promoter and writer about Arabian horses {{from the middle of}} the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body [...] "types" [...] of the breed, with the Kehilan being [...] "masculine", the Seglawi being [...] "feminine" [...] and the Muniqi being [...] "speedy". There were also lesser strains, sub-strains, and regional variations in strain names. Therefore, many Arabian horses were not only Asil, of pure blood, but also bred to be pure in strain, with crossbreeding between strains discouraged, though not forbidden, by some tribes. Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in <b>telegony,</b> believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of [...] "impure" [...] blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be [...] "contaminated" [...] by the stallion and hence no longer Asil.|$|E
500|$|For {{the ancient}} Greeks, {{the tale of}} the Trojan War and the {{surrounding}} events appeared in its most definitive form in the Epic Cycle of eight narrative poems from the archaic period in Greece (750 BC – 480 BC). The story of Troilus is {{one of a number of}} incidents that helped provide structure to a narrative that extended over several decades and 77 books from the beginning of the Cypria to the end of the <b>Telegony.</b> The character's death early in the war and the prophecies surrounding him demonstrated that all Trojan efforts to defend their home would be in vain. His symbolic significance is evidenced by linguistic analysis of his Greek name [...] "Troilos". It can be interpreted as an elision of the names of Tros and Ilos, the legendary founders of Troy, as a diminutive or pet name [...] "little Tros" [...] or as an elision of Troië (Troy) and lyo (to destroy). These multiple possibilities emphasise the link between the fates of Troilus and of the city where he lived. On another level, Troilus' fate can also be seen as foreshadowing the subsequent deaths of his murderer Achilles, and of his nephew Astyanax and sister Polyxena, who, like Troilus, die at the altar in at least some versions of their stories.|$|E
2500|$|The Epic Cycle ( [...] , Epikos Kyklos) was a {{collection}} of Ancient Greek epic poems, composed in dactylic hexameter and related {{to the story of}} the Trojan War, including the Cypria, the Aethiopis, the so-called Little Iliad, the Iliupersis, the Nostoi, and the <b>Telegony.</b> Scholars sometimes include the two Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, among the poems of the Epic Cycle, but the term is more often used to specify the non-Homeric poems as distinct from the Homeric ones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} mentions of the Bryges {{are contained}} in the historical writings of Herodotus, who relates them to Phrygians, stating that according to the Macedonians, the Bryges [...] "changed their name" [...] to Phryges after migrating into Anatolia, a movement which {{is thought to have}} happened between 1200 BC and 800 BC perhaps due to the Bronze Age collapse, particularly the fall of the Hittite Empire and the power vacuum that was created. In the Balkans, the Bryges occupied central Albania and northern Epirus, as well as Macedonia, mainly west of the Axios river, but also Mygdonia, which was conquered by the kingdom of Macedon in the early 5th century BC. They seem to have lived peacefully next to the inhabitants of Macedonia, however, Eugammon in his <b>Telegony,</b> drawing upon earlier epic traditions, mentions that Odysseus commanded the Epirotian Thesprotians against the Bryges. Small groups of Bryges, after the migration to Anatolia and the expansion of the kingdom of Macedon, were still left in northern Pelagonia and around Epidamnus.|$|E
60|$|There are, no doubt, {{already a}} number of unselfish and {{fortunately}} placed men {{who are able to}} do a certain amount of work in this direction; Professor Cossar Ewart, for example, one of those fine, subtle, unhonoured workers who are the glory of British science and the condemnation of our social order, has done much to clarify the discussion of <b>telegony</b> and prepotency, and there are many such medical men as Mr. Reid who broaden their daily practice by attention to these great issues. One thinks of certain other names. Professors Karl Pearson, Weldon, Lloyd Morgan, J. A. Thomson and Meldola, Dr. Benthall and Messrs. Bateson, Cunningham, Pocock, Havelock Ellis, E. A. Fay and Stuart Menteath occur to me, only to remind me how divided their attention has had to be. As many others, perhaps, have slipped my memory now. Not half a hundred altogether in all this wide world of English-speaking men! For one such worker we need fifty if this science of heredity is to grow to practicable proportions. We need a literature, we need a special public and an atmosphere of attention and discussion. Every man who grasps the New Republican idea brings these needs nearer satisfaction, but if only some day the New Republic could catch the ear of a prince, a little weary of being the costumed doll of grown-up children, the decoy dummy of fashionable tradesmen, or if it could invade and capture the mind of a multi-millionaire, these things might come almost at a stride. This missing science of heredity, this unworked mine of knowledge on the borderland of biology and anthropology, which for all practical purposes is as unworked now {{as it was in the}} days of Plato, is, in simple truth, ten times more important to humanity than all the chemistry and physics, all the technical and industrial science that ever has been or ever will be discovered.|$|E

50|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is that there was}} a wholly separate epic called the Thesprotis; and yet a fourth {{possibility is}} that the <b>Telegony</b> and Thesprotis were two separate poems that were at some stage compiled into a single <b>Telegony.</b> Most scholars at present tend to regard the third and fourth possibilities as unlikely, or at least worthless hypotheses, since neither possibility is demonstrable or falsifiable.|$|E
50|$|In Antiquity the <b>Telegony</b> {{may have}} also been known as the Thesprotis (Greek: Θεσπρωτίς), which is {{referred}} to once by Pausanias in the 2nd century CE; alternatively, the Thesprotis {{may have been a}} name for the first book of the <b>Telegony,</b> which is set in Thesprotia. Such naming of isolated episodes within a larger epic was common practice for the ancient readers of the Homeric epics.|$|E
50|$|The date of {{composition}} of the <b>Telegony</b> is uncertain. Cyrene, the native city of Eugammon, the purported author, was founded in 631 BCE; but the narrative details may have existed prior to Eugammon's version, perhaps even in the oral tradition. There is a distinct possibility that {{the author of the}} Odyssey knew at least some version of the <b>Telegony</b> story (the Thesprotian episode and Telegonus' unusual spear in the <b>Telegony</b> may have been based on Tiresias' prophecy in Odyssey book 11; but {{it is also possible that}} the Odyssey poet used the Telegonus story as a basis for Teiresias' prophecy). Certainly Eugammon's poem is most likely to have been composed in the 6th century BCE.|$|E

50|$|Both Schopenhauer and Herbert Spencer found <b>telegony</b> to be a {{credible}} theory; August Weismann, {{on the other}} hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by James Cossar Ewart in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician Karl Pearson pointed out that, if <b>telegony</b> was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, {{which is not the}} case.|$|E
50|$|These circumstantial reports {{seemed to}} confirm the ancient idea of <b>telegony</b> in heritability: Charles Darwin cited the example in On the Origin of Species (1859) and The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication (1868). The concept of <b>telegony,</b> that the seed of a male could {{continue}} to affect the offspring of a female, whether animal or human, had been inherited from Aristotle and remained a legitimate theory until experiments in the 1890s confirmed Mendelian inheritance. Biologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare using dominant and recessive alleles.|$|E
50|$|Cinaethon of Sparta (Κιναίθων ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος Kinaithon ho Lakedaimonios) is {{a legendary}} Greek poet to whom {{different}} sources ascribe the lost epics Oedipodea, Little Iliad and <b>Telegony.</b> Eusebius {{says that he}} flourished in 764/3 BC.|$|E
50|$|The brief {{fertilizing}} mystical union engenders Dionysus, and doubled unions, of a god and of {{a mortal}} man on one night, result, through <b>telegony,</b> in the semi-divine nature of Greek heroes such as Theseus and Heracles.|$|E
5000|$|In mammals, each sperm has the haploid set of {{chromosomes}} {{and each}} egg has another haploid set. During {{the process of}} fertilization a zygote with the diploid set is produced. This set will be inherited by every somatic cell of a mammal, with exactly half the genetic material coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of <b>telegony</b> is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of genetics and the reproductive process. Encyclopædia Britannica stated [...] "All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to <b>telegony,</b> must now be classed as superstitions." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} coined by August Weismann from the Greek words [...] (tèle) meaning 'far' and [...] (gonos) meaning 'offspring'. The name may also refer to Odysseus' son Telegonus; the lost poem {{named after him}} is <b>Telegony.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telegony</b> {{influenced}} late 19th-century racialist discourse: a {{woman who}} had once had a child with a non-Aryan man, it was argued, could never have a [...] "pure" [...] Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the Nazis.|$|E

50|$|The idea of <b>telegony</b> {{goes back}} to Aristotle. It states that {{individuals}} can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, fatherhood is not indivisible: paternity can be partitioned.|$|E
50|$|Among {{various other}} studies, he {{performed}} breeding experiments with horses and zebras, {{well before the}} rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's works. Ewart crossed a male zebra with a female pony {{to show that the}} theory of <b>telegony</b> inherited from the Greeks was unsound. <b>Telegony</b> held that a female with a history of mating with multiple males would pass on genetic qualities of all previous partners to her offspring. Ewart later bred the mare which had produced zebra-horse hybrids with a pony, and the offspring showed no zebra qualities in either markings or temperament. Ewart's goal was also to produce a draught animal for South African conditions, resistant to African diseases and more tractable than a mule.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Telegony</b> {{comprises}} {{two distinct}} episodes: Odysseus' voyage to Thesprotia, {{and the story}} of Telegonus. Probably each of the two books of the <b>Telegony</b> related one of these episodes. In current critical editions only two lines of the poem's original text survive. For its storyline we are dependent primarily on a summary of the Telegonus myth in Proclus' Chrestomathy. The poem opens after the events depicted in the Odyssey. According to Proclus' summary, the <b>Telegony</b> opens with the burial of Penelope's suitors. Odysseus makes sacrifices to the Nymphs. [...] He makes a voyage to Elis, where he visits an otherwise unknown figure Polyxenos, who gives him a bowl depicting the story of Trophonius. Odysseus returns to Ithaca and then travels to Thesprotia, presumably to make the sacrifices commanded by Tiresias in Odyssey 11. There he weds the Thesprotian queen Kallidike, who bears him a son, Polypoites. Odysseus fights for the Thesprotians in a war against the neighbouring Brygoi; the gods participate in the war, Ares routing Odysseus and the Thesprotians, countered by Athena, ever Odysseus' patron; Apollo intervenes between the battling gods. However, Kallidike is killed in the war, Polypoetes succeeds to the kingdom and Odysseus returns to Ithaca.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Telegony</b> (Greek: , Tēlegoneia; Telegonia) is a lost ancient Greek epic {{poem about}} Telegonus, son of Odysseus by Circe. His name ("born far away") is {{indicative}} of his birth on Aeaea, far from Odysseus' home of Ithaca. It {{was part of the}} Epic Cycle of poems that recounted the myths of the Trojan War as well as the events that led up to and followed it. The story of the <b>Telegony</b> comes chronologically after that of the Odyssey and is the final episode in the Epic Cycle. The poem was sometimes attributed in Antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta, but in one source it {{is said to have been}} stolen from Musaeus by Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene (see Cyclic poets).
