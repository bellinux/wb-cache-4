One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers brought it to Warwick, who refused to accept it, and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> outside his jurisdiction. Eventually, a group of Dominican friars brought it to Oxford. A proper burial could not be {{arranged}} while Gaveston was still excommunicate, and it was not until 2 January 1315, after the King had secured a papal absolution for his favourite, that he could have his body buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Dominican foundation of King's Langley Priory; the tomb is now lost. In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E

On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to where they found it.

25|$|Paganini was in {{possession}} of a number of fine string instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in Livorno, a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier Giuseppe Guarneri, for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> This particular violin {{came to be known as}} Il Cannone Guarnerius. On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.|$|E
25|$|Greed is a {{theme of}} the novel {{because it is a}} basic {{motivation}} for several of the characters. In the past, Marek and his team are thrust into a world that is one large battlefield between the French and the English. The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnautâ€™s greed in wanting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> This causes Marek and his team to be stuck in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E

Joseph Wheeler married into the property which was owned by his wife Daniella (b. 20 August 1841 m.8 February 1866 d.1895). Daniella had inherited the property when her previous husband, Benjamin Sherrod died. The Sherrods had bought the property from the Hickman family and expanded and added several buildings, including the two story dogtrot log cabin {{that came to be}} known as the Sherrod House. The Wheelers built their own house right next to the Sherrod house and occupied both houses while Daniella and Joe were alive.|$|E
25|$|In Dogma, Metatron {{is portrayed}} by Alan Rickman, stating that he {{acts as the}} Voice of God in {{situations}} where people hear God speak to them, as humanity is psychologically and physically incapable of hearing God's actual voice without their heads exploding. In {{the course of the}} film, he recruits abortion clinic worker Bethany Sloan (Linda Fiorentino), who is revealed {{over the course of the}} film to be the last living relative of Jesus, to stop two angels from unwittingly negating existence while God is incapacitated after he is attacked and left in a coma while in a mortal form. During a later conversation with Bethany, the Metatron notes that Jesus had trouble adapting to the news that he was God's son and asked Metatron <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> with Metatron admitting to Bethany that he regretted placing so much responsibility on a child.|$|E
25|$|After God and the archangels {{successfully}} battled the Darkness to submission at {{the beginning}} of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have the lust for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by other people, to become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade {{to the bottom of the}} Marianas Trench, only <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to someone else would release the Darkness from her cage.|$|E

He landed with elements of his division at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 14 January 1943 and began operations on nearby Goodenough Island. [...] The island had recently been captured from the Japanese but only a small Australian garrison was present to guard against any attempt by the enemy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> [...] Dummy buildings and fortifications were built to give the Japanese {{the impression that the}} Australian presence on Goodenough was greater than it actually was, and may have deterred them from attempting to retake the island. By April the Japanese threat to Goodenough had receded and an air strip was under construction.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, after a {{four-year}} disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to where it started. I went to the DC library and {{read some of the}} early stories. I tried {{to get a sense of}} what Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E

Around Jivevaneng, [...] east of Sattelberg, the 2/43rd had taken up a blocking position and in the early days of October fought a Japanese attack by a battalion from the 80th Infantry Regiment along the coast road to a halt. In an effort to shore up their western flank, the Australian 2/17th Infantry Battalion pressed towards Kumawa, which was met with a fierce response from the Japanese on 5 October when their line of communication from the west was threatened.

I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combinedâ€”a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print.

500|$|Piper's 2010 {{appearance}} in The End of Time, Tennant's final {{story as a}} series regular, was leaked by the press in May 2009 when Piper was seen photographed on location with Coduri and Tennant. Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part-human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about {{their lives in the}} parallel universe. Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose's story in the perfect way by choosing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the beginning of her acquaintance with the Doctor. [...] Piper's return for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary episode was confirmed in March 2013. Moffat wished to include Piper in the episode because he felt that she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who. As he did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' story arc, he chose instead to re-introduce her Bad Wolf persona. During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor. Reviewers noted similarities between the characterisation of Bad Wolf Rose and that of a plot device used by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Ted B. Kissell, a journalist for The Atlantic likened the War Doctor to Ebenezer Scrooge and dubbed Rose the [...] "Ghost of Doctors Yet to Come".|$|E

I probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home." [...] Despite some minor work made to [...] "Gigolo Aunt", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would [...] "spy" [...] on the band as they recorded the album.

Now with possession, the Storm took the ball the length of the field for a touchdown. Instead of increasing their lead before the half, the Vigilantes now trailed.

500|$|On June 8, Stoughton {{ordered a}} woman accused of {{witchcraft}} (Bridget Bishop) {{to be executed}} only two days later, though tradition had been to allow at least four days between order and execution. The following Monday the clergy were asked to officially weigh in on the issue. This was likely Phips asking for the opinion of Increase Mather, and his son Cotton, and {{to put it in}} writing. The response is called The Return of the Ministers, simultaneously urging caution and speedy prosecution. Most importantly it cautioned against, but did not disallow, or discredit, the admission of spectral evidence (accusations of a crime committed by one's [...] "spector", against which there is no alibi possible). The Mathers, father and son, and the other area ministers continued to debate this issue throughout the summer and into the fall, as documented by the minutes of the Cambridge Association. At the end of June, five more women were condemned to die. Phips granted a reprieve to one of these, but was impressed upon [...] "by some Salem gentlemen" [...] <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> At this point, Phips seemed to wash his hands of the proceedings, not relishing the idea of gaining the enmity of his own lieutenant governor and the clergymen allied with him, including the fully committed Cotton Mather, and the waffling Increase Mather. There is no record of Phips ever having travelled north to meet any of the [...] "afflicted", or attend a single Oyer and Terminer trial, or execution.
