Raid derivatives aimed at particular invertebrate species can contain other active agents such as the more toxic cyfluthrin, another synthetic pyrethroid.Currently Raid Ant & Roach Killer contains pyrethroids, piperonyl butoxide, and permethrin; other products contain <b>tetramethrin,</b> cypermethrin and imiprothrin as {{active ingredient}}s.

50|$|The first-generation pyrethroids, {{developed}} in the 1960s, include bioallethrin, <b>tetramethrin,</b> resmethrin and bioresmethrin. They are more active than the natural pyrethrum but are unstable in sunlight. Activity of pyrethrum and 1st-generation pyrethroids is often enhanced by addition of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (which itself has some insecticidal activity). With the 91/414/EEC review, many 1st-generation compounds have not been included on Annex 1, probably because the market is simply not big enough to warrant the costs of re-registration (rather than any special concerns about safety).|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include <b>tetramethrin,</b> allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} mode of action of type I {{pyrethroids}} on the voltage-dependent sodium current from honeybee olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), whose proper function in antenna is crucial for interindividual communication in this species. Under voltage-clamp, <b>tetramethrin</b> and permethrin induce a long lasting TTX-sensitive tail current upon repolarization, which {{is the hallmark of}} an abnormal prolongation of the open channel configuration. Permethrin and <b>tetramethrin</b> also slow down the sodium current fast inactivation. <b>Tetramethrin</b> and permethrin both bind to the closed state of the channel as suggested by the presence of an obvious tail current after the first single depolarization applied in the presence of either compounds. Moreover, at first sight, channel opening seems to promote <b>tetramethrin</b> and permethrin binding as evidenced by the progressive tail current summation along with trains of stimulations, <b>tetramethrin</b> being more potent at modifying channels than permethrin. However, a use-dependent increase in the sodium peak current along with stimulations suggests that the tail current accumulation could also be a consequence of progressively unmasked silent channels. Experiments with the sea anemone toxin ATX-II that suppresses sodium channels fast inactivation are consistent with the hypothesis that these silent channels are either in an inactivated state at rest, or that they normally inactivate before they open so that they do not participate to the control sodium current. In honeybee ORNs, three processes lead to a use-dependent pyrethroid-induced tail current accumulation: (i) a recruitment of silent channels that produces an increase in the peak sodium current, (ii) a slowing down of the sodium current inactivation produced by prolongation of channels opening and (iii) a typical deceleration in current deactivation. The use-dependent recruitment of silent sodium channels in honeybee ORNs makes pyrethroids more potent at modifying neuronal excitability...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} currrent {{investigation}} was to evaluate (a) the toxicity of three pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and tetramethrin); (b) {{the effect of these}} insecticides on the locomotor activity; and (c) the repellent effect of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) on two deltamethrin-resistant strains of Triatoma infestans from Argentina (El Chorro and La Toma), and one susceptible strain. The resistance ratios (RRs) obtained for the La Toma strain were: > 10, 769, 50. 7, and > 5. 2 for deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and <b>tetramethrin</b> respectively. The RRs for the El Chorro strain were: > 10, 769, 85. 8, and > 5. 2 for deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and <b>tetramethrin</b> respectively. The hyperactivity usually caused by the three pyrethroids was in both the deltamethrin-resistant strains compared to the susceptible reference strain. No differences were observed in the repellent effect of DEET between the three groups. These results indicate that the deltamethrin-resistant insects have a cross resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin and <b>tetramethrin,</b> and are also resistant to the first symptom of pyrethroid poisoning (hyperactivity). However, the sensorial process related to DEET repellency {{does not appear to be}} altered...|$|E

A comparison was made between LS-SVM and PLS methods by applying them to simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of cypermethrin, permethrin and <b>tetramethrin.</b> The UV absorbance spectra of the methanolic solutions of the analytes were measured in the concentration ranges, 0. 1 - 12. 9, 0. 1 - 24. 9 and 0. 1 - 13. 8 µg mL- 1 for cypermethrin, permethrin and <b>tetramethrin,</b> respectively. The simultaneous determination of cypermetrin, permetrin and tetrametrin by UV spectrophotometry is a difficult problem in analytical chemistry, due to spectra interferences. The resolution of mixture of cypermetrin, permetrin and tetrametrin by chemometrics methods was performed. The root means square error of prediction (RMSEP) for cypermetrin, permetrin and tetrametrin by PLS and LS-SVM models were 0. 1629, 0. 2828, 0. 1984 and 0. 0766, 0. 0907, 0. 0467, respectively.

40|$|International audiencePyrethroids are widely-used {{chemical}} insecticides, {{to which}} humans are commonly exposed, and known to alter functional expression of drug metabolizing enzymes. Limited data have additionally suggested that drug transporters, that constitute key-actors {{of the drug}} detoxification system, may also be targeted by pyrethroids. The present study was therefore designed to analyze the potential regulatory effects of these pesticides towards activities of main ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) drug transporters, using transporter-overexpressing cells. The pyrethroids allethrin and <b>tetramethrin</b> were found to inhibit various ABC and SLC drug transporters, including multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1 B 1, organic anion transporter (OAT) 3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT 2, with IC 50 values however ranging from 2. 6 muM (OCT 1 inhibition by allethrin) to 77. 6 muM (OAT 3 inhibition by <b>tetramethrin)</b> and thus much higher than pyrethroid concentrations (in the nM range) reached in environmentally pyrethroid-exposed humans. By contrast, allethrin and <b>tetramethrin</b> cis-stimulated OATP 2 B 1 activity and failed to alter activities of OATP 1 B 3, OAT 1 and MATE 2 -K, whereas P-glycoprotein activity was additionally moderately inhibited. Twelve other pyrethoids used at 100 muM did not block activities of the various investigated transporters, or only moderately inhibited some of them (inhibition by less than 50 %). In silico analysis of structure-activity relationships next revealed that molecular parameters, including molecular weight and lipophilicity, are associated with transporter inhibition by allethrin/tetramethrin and successfully predicted transporter inhibition by the pyrethroids imiprothrin and prallethrin. Taken together, these data fully demonstrated that two pyrethoids, i. e., allethrin and <b>tetramethrin,</b> can act as regulators of the activity of various ABC and SLC drug transporters, but only when used at high and non-relevant concentrations, making unlikely any contribution of these transporter activity alterations to pyrethroid toxicity in environmentally exposed humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of neurons from the honey bee olfactory system to pyrethroid insecticides was studied using the patch-clamp technique on central ‘antennal lobe neurons ’ (ALNs) in cell culture. In these neurons, the voltage-dependent sodium currents {{are characterized by}} negative potential for activation, fast kinetics of activation and inactivation, {{and the presence of}} cumulative inactivation during train of depolarizations. Perfusion of pyrethroids on these ALN neurons submitted to repetitive stimulations induced (1) an acceleration of cumulative inactivation, and (2) a marked slowing of the tail current recorded upon repolarization. Cypermethrin and permethrin accelerated cumulative inactivation of the sodium current peak in a similar manner and <b>tetramethrin</b> was even more effective. The slow-down of channel deactivation was markedly dependent on the type of pyrethroid. With cypermethrin, a progressive increase of the tail current amplitude along with successive stimulations reveals a traditionally described use-dependent recruitment of modified sodium channels. However, an unexpected decrease in this tail current was revealed with <b>tetramethrin.</b> If one considers the calculated percentage of modified channels as an index of pyrethroids effects, ALNs are significantly more susceptible to <b>tetramethrin</b> than to permethrin or cypermethrin for a single depolarization, but this difference attenuates with repetitive activity. Further comparison with peripheral neurons from antennae suggest that these modifications are neuron type specific.

40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the effects of the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide <b>tetramethrin,</b> which is one of the chemicals used to minimize the negative effects (decrease of nutritional value during production, storage and consumption of food sources) of insects, rodents, wild herbs and fungus living on and/or around human and animal body and plants, on serum proteins (albumin, α-globulin, β-globulin and γ-globulin) of albino mice (Mus musculus). Method: Sub lethal dosages (250 and 500 mg/kg/day) of <b>tetramethrin</b> were given orally to mice of 4 - 8 -weeks, for a period of 13 weeks. At the end of the study, blood was collected by heart puncture, and then put into Durheim tubes to coagulate at 20 - 25 oC for 45 minutes. Tubes were centrifuged (+ 4 oC) at 7000 - 7500 rpm for 15 minutes, after which approximately 20 - 30 µl serum was collected. The analysis of the serum proteins was established by cellulose acetate electrophoresis assay. Results: At the end of the study, gender gap analysis was not taken into consideration between male and female mice, since there were no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the levels of the albumin, α-globulin, β-globulin in the serum of the control group, acetone group and <b>tetramethrin</b> applied T 1 and T 2 groups. It was determined that the results of serum proteins of mice in the acetone applied group were not statistically different from the control group (p> 0. 05). Changes of the amounts of the serum albumin, α-globulin and β-globulin in the tetrametrin applied groups (250 and 500 mg <b>tetramethrin</b> / kg / day) compared to the control group were statistically insignificant, whereas the results of the γ-globulin were statistically significant in both groups. The results of albumin, α-globulin and β-globulin quantities are compared between T 1 and T 2 groups and it were statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). On the other hand it was found that decrease in the amount of γ-globulin was statistically significant in T 2 group compared to the T 1 group results (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: In this study it was found that <b>tetramethrin</b> causes a decrease on the amount of γ-globulin in the test group. It is thought that the alteration of γ-globulin caused by this insecticide has specifically a critical impact upon humoral immunity and further investigations should be done about the harmful effects of the unconscious use of this household insecticide, even at low doses, to the human health...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which external Ca ions block sodium channels were studied by a gigaohm seal patch clamp method using membranes excised from N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells. <b>Tetramethrin</b> was used to prolong the open time of single channels so that the current-voltage relationship could be readily determined {{over a wide range}} of membrane potentials. Comparable experiments were performed in the absence of <b>tetramethrin.</b> Increasing external Ca ions from 0. 18 to 9. 0 mM reduced the single channel conductance without causing flickering. From the dose-response relation the dissociation constant for Ca block at 0 mV was estimated to be 32. 4 +/- 1. 05 mM. The block was intensified by hyperpolarization. The voltage dependence indicates that Ca ions bind to sodium channels at a site located 37 +/- 2 % of the electrical distance from the outside. The current increased with increasing external Na concentrations but showed a saturation; the concentration for half-maximal saturation was estimated to be 185 mM at - 50 mV and 204 mM at 0 mV. A model consisting of a one-ion pore with four barriers and three wells can account for the observations that deviate from the independence principle, namely, the saturation of current, block by Ca ions, and rectification in current-voltage relationship. The results suggest that the Ca-induced decrease of the macroscopic sodium current results from a reduced single sodium channel conductance...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePyrethroids are {{insecticides}} {{frequently used}} in agriculture {{and in the}} home; exposure occurs through dietary and non-dietary pathways, including indoor and outdoor environmental contamination. Our objective was to study the potential determinants of pyrethroid metabolite concentrations measured in children's urine samples and in the dust of their homes. Specifically, we measured urinary metabolites from morning spot samples of 245 six-year- old children living in Brittany (France) in 2009 - 2012 and from dust vacuumed {{from the floor of}} their homes. Mothers reported home insecticide use, dietary habits, sociodemographic data; residential and school proximity to agricultural crops was assessed with spatialized data. The metabolites cis-DBCA, trans-DCCA, cisDCCA, 3 -PBA, and F-PBA were detected in 84, 95, 64, 63, and 16 % of the urine samples, respectively. Permethrin, cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, and <b>tetramethrin</b> pyrethroids were detected in 100, 56, 9, 15, and 26 % of the dust samples, respectively. Multiple regression analysis suggested diet plays a role in children's exposure, in particular, the food groups "pasta, rice or semolina" (for cis-DCCA and F-PBA), fruit (3 -PBA), "breakfast cereals and whole grain bread" (cis-DBCA), and the global proportion of organic food in diet (for cis-DBCA, trans-DCCA). Children with a parent occupationally exposed to pesticides were about 3 -times more likely to have higher urinary concentrations of 3 -PBA (OR = 2. 8, 95 % CI [1. 2; 6. 5]). Dust content was correlated mainly with household insecticide use: higher mean concentrations of permethrin (beta = 0. 8 [0. 3; 1. 3], in mu g/g) and an increased risk of a detectable level of cyfluthrin (OR = 4. 7 [1. 7; 12. 9]) were observed in home dust, for indoor use of at least twice a year.

Spraying was performed {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers' instructions and in an overdosed manner in order to simulate worst-case conditions or an unforeseeable Misuse. In addition, we examined electro-vaporizers. The Respicon (TM) aerosol monitoring system was applied to determine inhalation exposure. During normal spraying (10 seconds) and during the following 2 - 3 minutes, exposure concentrations ranged from 70 to 590 mu g/m(3) for the pyrethroids <b>tetramethrin,</b> d-phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bloallethrin, and the pyrethrins. Calculated inhalable doses were 2 - 16 mu g. A concentration of approximately 850 mu g chlorpyrifos/m(3) (inhalable dose: approximately 20 mu g) was determined when the "Contra insect fly spray" was applied. Highest exposure concentrations (1100 - 2100 mu g/m(3)) were measured for piperonyl butoxide (PBO), corresponding to an inhalation intake of 30 - 60 mu g. When simulating worst-case conditions, exposure concentrations of 200 - 3400 mu g/m(3) and inhalable doses of 10 - 210 mu g were determined for the various active substances. Highest concentrations (4800 - 8000 mu g/m(3)) were measured for PBO (inhalable: 290 - 480 mu g). By applying the electro-vaporizer "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations for d-allethrin were in the range of 5 - 12 mu g/m(3) and 0. 5 - 2 mu g/m(3) for PBO while with the "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations of 0. 4 - 5 mu g/m(3) for pyrethrins and 1 - 7 mu g/m(3) for PBO were measured. Potential dermal exposures were determined using exposure pads. Between 80 and 1000 mu g active substance (<b>tetramethrin,</b> phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bioallethrin, pyrethrins, chlorpyrifos) were deposited on the clothing of the total body surface area of the spray user. Highest levels (up to 3000 mu g) were determined for PBO. Worst-case uses of the sprays led to 5 - 9 times higher concentrations. Also a 2 -hour stay nearby an operating electro-vaporizer led to a contamination of the clothing (total amounts on the whole body were 450 mu g d-allethrin and 50 mu g PBO for "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer and 80 mu g pyrethrins and 190 mu g PBO for "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer). Human blomonitoring data revealed urine concentrations of the metabolite (E) -trans-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid ((E) -trans-CDCA) between 1. 7 mu g/l and 7. 1 mu g/l after 5 minutes of exposure to the different sprays. Also the use of electro-vaporizers led to (E) -trans-CDCA concentrations in the urine in the range of 1. 0 mu g/l to 6. 2 mu g/l (1 - 3 hours exposure period). The exposure data presented can be used for performing human risk assessment when these biocidal products were applied indoors.

40|$|DEET and IR 3535 are insect repellents present {{worldwide}} in commercial products; their efficacy has been mainly evaluated in mosquitoes. This study compares the toxicological effects and the behavioral responses induced by both repellents on the blood-sucking bug Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), {{one of the}} main vectors of Chagas disease. When applied topically, the Median Lethal Dose (72 h) for DEET was 220. 8 µg/insect. Using IR 3535, topical application of 500 µg/insect killed no nymphs. The minimum concentration that produced repellency was the same for both compounds: 1, 15 µg/cm 2. The effect of a mixture DEET:IR 3535 1 : 1 was similar to that of their pure components. Flushing out was assessed in a chamber with a shelter containing groups of ten nymphs. The repellents were aerosolized on the shelter and the number of insects leaving it was recorded for 60 min. During that time, 0. 006 g/m 3 of the positive control <b>tetramethrin</b> flushed out 76. 7 % of the nymphs, while 1. 76 g/m 3 of DEET or IR 3535 flushed out 30 and 0 %, respectively. The concentrations required for both compounds to produce toxicity or flushing out are too high to have any practical applications. However, they showed a promising repellency. Additional research should be done to evaluate their possible use for personal protection against T. infestans bites...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{regulations}} and bans {{regarding the use}} of traditional toxic chemicals against marine fouling organisms and the practical impediments to the commercialization of natural product antifoulants, there is an urgent need for compounds that are antifouling-active, environmentally friendly, and have a potential for commercial application. In this study, a series of common, commercially available pyrethroid products, which are generally used as environmentally safe insecticides, was evaluated for antifouling activity in the laboratory using an anti-settlement test with cyprids of the barnacle Balanus albicostatus and also in a field experiment. Laboratory assay showed that all eleven pyrethroids (namely, rich d-trans-allethrin, Es-biothrin, rich d-prallethrin, S-prallethrin, <b>tetramethrin,</b> rich d-tetramethrin, phenothrin, cyphenothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, and high active cypermethrin) were able to inhibit barnacle settlement (EC 50 range of 0. 0316 to 87. 00 mu g/ml) without significant toxicity. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggested that the cyano group at the alpha-carbon position had a significant influence on the expression of antifouling activity in pyrethroids. In the field, the antifouling activity of pyrethroids was further confirmed, with the most potent pyrethroids being cypermethrin and high active cypermethrin, which displayed efficiency comparable with that of tributyltin. In summary, our investigation indicated that these pyrethroids have a great and practical commercial potential as antifouling agents.

40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} and environmentally friendly analytical methodology is proposed for extracting and preconcentrating pyrethroids from water samples prior to gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NCI-MS) analysis. Fourteen pyrethroids {{were selected for}} this work: bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, λ-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenvalerate, fenpropathrin, τ-fluvalinate, permethrin, phenothrin, resmethrin, <b>tetramethrin</b> and tralomethrin. The method is based on ultrasound-assisted emulsification-extraction (UAEE) of a water-immiscible solvent in an aqueous medium. Chloroform was used as extraction solvent in the UAEE technique. Target analytes were quantitatively extracted achieving an enrichment factor of 200 when 20 mL aliquot of pure water spiked with pyrethroid standards was extracted. The method was also evaluated with tap water and river water samples. Method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0. 03 to 35. 8 ng L− 1 with RSDs values ≤ 3 – 25 % (n = 5). The coefficients of estimation of the calibration curves obtained following the proposed methodology were ≥ 0. 998. Recovery values were {{in the range of}} 45 – 106 %, showing satisfactory robustness of the method for analyzing pyrethroids in water samples. The proposed methodology was applied for the analysis of river water samples. Cypermethrin was detected at concentration levels ranging from 4. 94 to 30. 5 ng L− 1.

40|$|Nowadays, {{parasitology}} {{is facing}} a number of crucial challenges, including the urgent request of effective control tools against arthropod vectors of medical and veterinary importance. Ticks transmit at least the same amount or even more pathogen species {{than any other group}} of blood-feeding arthropods worldwide affecting humans and animals. Besides the development of vaccines against viruses vectored by ticks, integrated pest management practices aimed at reducing tick interactions with livestock, emerging pheromone-based control tools, and few biological control agents have been also proposed. The extensive employ of acaricides and tick repellents still remains the two most effective and ready-to-use strategies. However, the use of synthetic acaricides is limited by the development of resistance in several tick species as well as by heavy environmental concerns. In this scenario, the exploitation of botanicals as cheap and effective sources of tick repellents may represent a valid alternative, and the preservation of ethnobotanical information on the repellent and acaricidal potential of plants is crucial. On the other hand, novel photodynamic acaricides have been recently described, with a toxicity against ticks which far exceed some of the acaricides currently marketed (e. g. <b>tetramethrin).</b> In this brief review, I provide a focus on some hot news in tick control, with special reference to tick repellents of botanical origin and new photodynamic fluorescent acaricides. To my mind, knowledge on both the mentioned research issues may help researchers to build valuable roadmaps to boost tick control programs worldwide...|$|E
40|$|In ovarian granulosa cells, LH depolarizes the {{membrane}} potential and induces steroid production. The membrane currents of porcine granulosa cells in primary culture were studied {{by means of}} the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique to investigate whether the ionic channels are involved in the effects of LH. We identified and characterized two types of K+ currents-a transient outward current (Ito) and a delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) -and one Ca 2 + current (Ic,). I and IK were voltage- and calcium-dependent. Both currents were blocked by 4 -aminopyridine, a K+ channel blocker, but only IK was sensitive to tetraethylammonium, another K+ channel blocker. I, was inactivated within 50 ms of the test pulse. Nifedipine and verapamil, L-type CA 2 + channel blockers, did not suppress I, even at a concentration of 10 jIM. <b>Tetramethrin</b> (1 AM), a T-type Ca 2 + channel blocker, decreased, by 38. 4 5. 6 % (n = 3). These findings suggest that the current may be a T-type Ca 2 + current. LH and dibutyryl cAMP, potent stimulants of steroid production, attenuated Io, only by 13. 9 1. 8 % (n = 7) and 21. 0 1. 5 % (n = 4), respectively. However, they did not affect IK and Ic,. These results indicated that LH does not modulate CA 2 + current directly, but it slightly decreased I through cAMP elevation. The LH-induced inhibition of I,,, may be involved in the depolarizing effect of LH and may play some role in steroid secretion or other functions in granulosa cells...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic pyrethroidal {{compounds}} undergo biodegradation in mammals both oxidatively and hydrolytically, {{and depending}} on the type of compound, either of the pathways may predominate. Thus, (+) - or (+/-) -trans isomers of the chrysanthemumate ester of primary alcohols such as fenothrin, furamethrin, proparthrin, resmethrin, and <b>tetramethrin</b> (and possibly permethrin, too) are metabolized mainly through hydrolysis of the ester linkage, with subsequent oxidation and/or conjugation of the component alcohol and acid moieties. On the other hand, the corresponding (+) -cis enantiometers and chrysanthemumate of secondary alcohols like allethrin are resistant to hydrolytic attack, and biodegraded via oxidation at various sites of the molecule. These rapid metabolic degradations, together with the presumable incomplete absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, would generally contribute to the low acute toxicity of synthetic pyrethroids. These compounds are neither skin irritants nor skin sensitizers, and inhalation toxicity as well as dermal toxicity are fairly low. Neither is teratogenic in rats, mice, and/or rabbits or mutagenic on various bacterial strains. Subacute and chronic feeding of higher amounts of the compounds to rats invariably causes some histopathological changes in liver; however, these are neither indicative nor suggestive of tumorigenicity. Based on existing toxicological information, the present recommended use patterns might afford sufficient safety margin on human population. However, in extending usage to agricultural pest control, much more extensive investigations should be forthcoming from both chemical and biological aspects, since there is scant information on the fate of these pyrethroids in the environment. Also several of the compounds may be very toxic to certain kinds of fish and arthropods...|$|E

In {{the perspective of a}} cumulative risk assessment, a multi-residue analytical method based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis in indoor dust of several classes of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of health concern, from trace to highly concentrated compounds, including musk fragrances, organochlorines (OCs), organophosphates (OPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and pyrethroids. The method was validated in terms of limits of quantification (LOQ), and accuracy and precision via spiking experiments on an inert material (Celite(®) 545) and replicate analysis of the standard reference material SRM 2585 supplied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Method LOQs for 200 mg samples of sieved dust were 26 ng g(- 1) for PCBs and some OCs, 65 ng g(- 1) for musks, OPs, PAHs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, other OCs and some phthalates, 132 ng g(- 1) for butylbenzylphthalate (BBP), 197 ng g(- 1) for tributylphosphate and 1579 ng g(- 1) for other phthalates. Quadratic calibration curves were established for each compound by analyzing at least five calibration solutions and exhibited determination coefficients higher than 0. 999. The method was successfully applied to the SRM 2585 and seven real indoor dust samples. The results obtained on SRM 2585 demonstrate both excellent reproducibility and agreement with the indicative, reference or certified values and provide, for the first time, indicative concentrations for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diisononylphthalate (DiNP) and <b>tetramethrin.</b> The results obtained on real dust samples illustrate the ability of the proposed method to quantify a wide range of SVOCs in a single analysis, making it appropriate for environmental monitoring programs or large-scale studies with a large number of samples...|$|E

In this study, the pyrethroid metabolites in workers' urine samples were monitored {{for the first}} time with a novel sample pretreatment process combining hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and in-syringe derivatization (ISD) followed by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) analysis. A micro-syringe pre-filled with derivatizing agents and syringe needle connected to an extracting solvent impregnated hollow fiber segment was used as the LPME probe. Pyrethroid metabolites were extracted and enriched simultaneously from urine samples by HF-LPME sampling and acid hydrolysis at 70 A degrees C for 10 min. After sampling, the ISD was performed by mixing the extracting solution and derivatizing agents through plunger movements, followed by GC-ECD analysis. Parameters influencing the HF-LPME efficiency and ISD were investigated and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the method provided enrichment factors of 69. 8 - 154. 6, repeatability from 5. 0 to 12 % (n = 5), and good linearity (R (2) = 0. 9980 - 0. 9998) for interested analytes spiked in urine samples. The method detection limits ranged from 1. 6 to 17 ng/mL. A comparison was performed between the proposed method and conventional methods. The proposed method was applied to analyze pyrethroid metabolites in the urine samples collected from workers of pesticide formulation plants. The results suggested that the proposed HF-LPME coupled ISD method was a rapid, simple, efficient, and eco-friendly technique in the biomonitoring of metabolites of pyrethroids in workers' urine...|$|E

There is considerable scientific interest in the possible role of environmental contaminants in the etiology of mammary tumors, specifically in relation to synthetic chemical substances released into the environment to which living beings are either directly or indirectly exposed. In this study, the presence of pyrethroid insecticide was observed in adjacent adipose tissue of canine mammary tumor. High Precision Liquid Chromatography - HPLC was adapted to detect and identify environmental contaminants in adipose tissue adjacent to malignant mammary tumor in nine female dogs, without predilection for breed or age. After surgery, masses were carefully examined for malignant neoplastic lesions. Five grams of adipose tissue adjacent to the tumor were collected to detect of environmental contaminants. The identified pyrethroids were allethrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and <b>tetramethrin,</b> with a contamination level of 33. 3 %. Histopathology demonstrated six female dogs (66. 7 %) as having complex carcinoma and three (33. 3 %) with simple carcinoma.

The contamination level was observed in more aggressive tumors. This was the first report in which the level of environmental contaminants could be detected in adipose tissue of female dogs with malignant mammary tumor, by HPLC. Results suggest the possible involvement of pyrethroid in the canine mammary tumor carcinogenesis.
