5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy. <b>The</b> <b>controversies</b> over the Bill of Rights that were {{generated by the}} Cold War ushered {{in a new era}} in American Civil liberties. In 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the geographic rivalry between the two teams, <b>the</b> <b>controversies</b> surrounding Lane Kiffin, and the performances of the players on each team. Virginia Tech played in the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2006, losing to Georgia 31-24, and the 2009 game was its fourth appearance in the game. It was Tennessee's fifth appearance in the game, and the Volunteers had most recently lost to Clemson in the 2004 contest, 27-14. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Virginia Tech was 0-2 in games held in Atlanta during 2010, it had lost four consecutive games to SEC foes, and it had never won back-to-back bowl games (Tech won the 2009 Orange Bowl). Despite those factors, Virginia Tech was an early 4.5-point favorite and was listed as a 5.5-point favorite by spread bettors {{on the day before}} the game.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next major}} study on <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> emerged in 1962 when Emery Battis {{published}} Saints and Sectaries: Anne Hutchinson and <b>the</b> Antinomian <b>Controversy</b> in <b>the</b> Massachusetts Bay Colony.

5|$|The United States {{reinstated}} {{sanctions against}} Yugoslavia in March 1998 when the Kosovo War started. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>controversies</b> at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested {{by one of the}} tightest votings (213-213) in the entire history of the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli had a {{profound}} influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which {{changed the course of}} the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in <b>the</b> <b>controversies</b> of this period.|$|E
