2500|$|The rate {{of loss of}} {{moisture}} can be controlled by coating the planks with any substance that is relatively impermeable to moisture; ordinary mineral oil is usually quite effective. Coating the ends of logs with oil or thick paint improves their quality upon drying. Wrapping planks or logs in materials which will allow some movement {{of moisture}}, generally works very well provided the wood is first treated against fungal infection by coating in petrol/gasoline or oil. Mineral oil will generally not soak in more than 1–2mm below the surface and is easily <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>planing</b> when the timber is suitably dry.|$|R
