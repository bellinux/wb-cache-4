5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat {{as the solution}} to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} not be able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, {{so that they would}} not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against JNA attacks.|$|E

5000|$|The Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan {{was signed}} in December 1954. He {{requested}} and secured from Congress their [...] "Formosa Resolution" [...] in January 1955, which gave Eisenhower unprecedented power in advance {{to use military force}} at any level of his choosing in defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. The Resolution bolstered the morale of the Chinese nationalists, and signaled to Beijing that the U.S. was committed <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|The bloody {{fighting}} obliged Paik to {{call for}} emergency reinforcements <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The Eighth Army responded immediately by sending the US 27th Infantry {{as well as the}} ROK 10th Regiment from the ROK 8th Division to reinforce the ROK 1st Division's three regiments. US Air Force aircraft also conducted a carpet bombing campaign against the advancing North Korean positions to undetermined effect. Around that time the KPA 15th Division, which had been supporting the KPA 13th Division, withdrew from the front to attack elsewhere, leaving the ROK 1st Division, with the US 27th Infantry, and the KPA 13th Division as principal opponents in the conflict that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was forced}} to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again, and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan. The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions {{such as this one}} for two more weeks until it was overwhelmed at the Battle of Taejon, however by that time the Pusan Perimeter would be in place, and other US divisions would be able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings, when American forces would finally defeat the North Korean Army, ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but {{did not do so}} for fear of ambush. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E

50|$|The French and Germans {{fought for}} control of the {{mountain}} peak during the First World War. Fighting took place throughout 1915. 30,000 died near Hartmannswillerkopf during the First World War, with the majority of deaths suffered by the French. After about 11 months of fierce combat, both sides began to focus most of their attention farther north on the Western Front. Only enough men <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> were left at Hartmannswillerkopf. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> remained relatively stable {{for the remainder of the}} war and generally only artillery exchanges took place.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to {{most other}} Polish armies during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the Kraków Army managed to {{withstand}} the initial German assault on Silesia and retreat steadily eastwards. The Carpathians {{in the south and}} the Vistula river to the north provided enough cover for the army to focus on delaying actions {{in the path of the}} advancing Germans. However, the German numerical and technical superiority meant that the Polish forces were too weak to counter-attack and the best choice for <b>the</b> army was <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of rivers and major towns on the path of the Polish retreat.|$|R
5|$|The 2/18th {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} Tengah Airfield, but by 1:00pm in the afternoon of 9 February they {{had been reduced to}} only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south-east of the airfield, occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road, with the 2/29th Battalion on their left. Throughout the night of 9/10 February, minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes. The battalion continued <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> until 6:00am when, following receipt of orders to withdraw, it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve. The carrier platoon covered the battalion's withdrawal, and amidst heavy artillery shelling, they ambushed two Japanese columns, each roughly company-sized, inflicting heavy casualties upon them with their Vickers machine-guns before breaking contact.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the {{advancing}} German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood {{in the path of the}} German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Belgo-Congolese {{situation}} remained difficult {{until early}} June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They {{then decided to}} try and sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. <b>To</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered {{by the arrival of}} a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.|$|E

50|$|While General Napoleon Bonaparte campaigned in Egypt, the Second Coalition {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} French-occupied Italy. General of Division (MG) Barthélemy Schérer fought inconclusive actions the Austrians at Pastrengo, Verona, and Legnago on 26 March 1799. Feldmarschal-Leutnant (FML) Pál Kray and his Austrians then defeated Schérer at the Battle of Magnano on April 4th. This defeat forced the French army into a long retreat. Attempts by Schérer <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of <b>the</b> Mincio and Oglio rivers failed when an Austrian force led by FML Josef Vukassovich turned his northern flank. Schérer, completely out of his depth, handed over army command to the more capable MG Moreau. Austria's Russian allies, led by Suvorov, soon began appearing at the front.|$|R
50|$|The Montenegrin army {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> Berane-Andrijevica-Mojkovac-Tara River <b>line</b> until withdrawing on 18 January. The Austrians {{then continued}} pushing their offensive south.|$|R
5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range firepower and boarding with intent to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} Masan {{remained}} a bitter stalemate {{during the entire}} six weeks of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. Each side attempted several offensives on the other {{in an attempt to}} force a withdrawal, but the North Koreans were unable to pierce the UN perimeter, and the UN troops were unable to overwhelm the North Koreans to the point they were forced to withdraw. The battle itself was a tactical tie, since neither side could decisively defeat the other, however the UN units achieved their strategic goal of preventing the North Koreans from advancing further east and threatening Pusan. Instead, they were able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against repeated attacks until the Inchon attack, and were thus successful in defeating the North Korean army in subsequent engagements.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{penetration}} to the north, the retreating 34th Infantry moved south to Nonsan. On July 15, the 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by troops from the Republic of Korea Army. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops {{on the west side}} of the river. At 03:00 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of the 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.|$|E
2500|$|At noon, the 7th Army {{headquarters}} {{concluded that}} the loss of Allemant, Vaudesson, Chavignon and Malmaison, made it necessary <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> from Pinon <b>to</b> Chavignon and to form a new line from there to Malmaison; it was also decided to withdraw the artillery from the Pinon Forest. At noon, Group Crépy was given command of the 52nd Division and Group Vailly command of the last two battalions of the 43rd Reserve and 9th divisions.

5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{with a handful of}} replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E
5|$|Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still {{hoped to}} re-establish {{the front to}} the west of the city, with the aid of {{divisions}} from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, and he had been driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy.|$|E
5000|$|The Michigan Argonaut {{summarized}} Michigan's play as follows: [...] "On {{the whole}} the boys played a good game. Their passing and running were excellent.

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque {{was placed in}} charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted {{to make his way}} back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E

50|$|Mahone's Division {{was moved}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> between <b>the</b> James River and the Appomattox River after the action at Hatcher's Run. When the Union general assault of April 2 occurred, Mahone marched his {{division}} west through Chesterfield County {{and joined the}} rest of the army at Amelia Court House. On April 7, after Ewell's surrender the previous day at the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Mahone's Division held off the pursuing II Corps at the Battle of High Bridge, but was unable to successfully burn the bridge to prevent Union pursuit. That afternoon, the division took up position near Cumberland Church and held off two charges by the Union II Corps. Mahone's Division became part of Longstreet's Corps and fell back to a position north of Appomattox Court House. While preparing for an attack of the II Corps, the 41st Virginia received word of the cease-fire that would {{set the stage for the}} final surrender of Lee's army.|$|R
50|$|The {{defeat of}} Italian forces {{did not go}} unnoticed and soon the German Africa Corps (Deutsches Afrikakorps), {{commanded}} by Erwin Rommel, were sent in to reinforce the Italians. Although ordered <b>to</b> simply <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> Rommel launched an offensive from El Agheila in March 1941 which, {{with the exception of}} Tobruk, managed to press the Allies beyond Salum on the Egyptian border, effectively putting both sides back at their approximate pre-war positions.|$|R
50|$|The {{efforts of}} the Totenkopf, Wiking and Hermann Göring {{divisions}} allowed <b>the</b> Germans <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> Vistula <b>line</b> and establish Army Group Vistula.
