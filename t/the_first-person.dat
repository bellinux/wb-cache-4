5|$|At the 1999 Game Critics Awards, Redemption {{was named}} Best RPG ahead of <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> action RPG, Deus Ex. In 2014, Gameranx listed {{the game as}} one of the 22 Best Vampire games of all time.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces {{uses the}} Jedi game engine, which was {{developed}} {{specifically for the}} game. The engine adds gameplay features to <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter genre which were uncommon {{at the time of}} release, including level designs with multiple floors and the ability to look up and down.|$|E
5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed}} in a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes. Presented from <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> perspective, the player can customize Denton's various abilities such as weapon skills or lockpicking, increasing his effectiveness in these areas; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E

5|$|In its pronouns, E distinguishes for person between first, second, and third; {{in number}} between {{singular}} and plural; and, {{in the case}} of <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> plural, between inclusive and exclusive we. E does not, however, make distinctions for grammatical gender.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. <b>The</b> <b>first-person</b> stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E
5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North American audiences, Angel Heart {{has gained a}} cult following. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan stated the film was {{a major influence on}} his 2000 film Memento. Video game developer Ken Levine stated that Angel Heart was one of several films that inspired <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter game BioShock Infinite.|$|E

5|$|Critically acclaimed, {{the game}} {{received}} an aggregated score of 94% from both GameRankings and Metacritic. The gameplay and story received particular praise, while criticism targeted {{the failure of}} the game to substantially innovate <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter genre. The game won numerous awards from gaming websites, including IGN's Best Xbox 360 Game. It was the top-selling game worldwide for 2007, selling around seven million copies by January 2008 and almost sixteen million by November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Evolve uses an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, where five players—four {{playing as}} hunters and one as the monster—battle {{against each other}} on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay is based on <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E

40|$|This thesis compares <b>the</b> {{unreliable}} <b>first-person</b> narrator {{in three}} British novels: A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, and The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks. <b>The</b> unreliable <b>first-person</b> narrative form {{has the power}} to assimilate the reader's mind with that of the narrator and make him/her believe whatever the narrator wants, even though the events that are being described can be truly shocking. This thesis analyses why and how these authors use <b>the</b> unreliable <b>first-person</b> narrative form, as well as its impacts on the reader. Key words: unreliable first-person narration, British novels, 20 th century, male protagonis...|$|R

Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an escape pod, which is {{launched}} out of the game, and crash land in Sugar Rush, a candy-themed kart racing game.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II {{was well}} received. The game holds an {{aggregate}} score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews. The combination of puzzles and gameplay drew praise from critics, who {{indicated that the}} game builds upon the qualities found in Dark Forces. The user control of the game was praised, especially {{the control of the}} lightsaber. The game was compared positively with Doom, a significant game in <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter genre.|$|E
5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video game in <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter genre at the time, but {{also indicated that}} Dark Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms {{tended to focus on}} the game being too short, as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Sam Catlin and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Slade, marking his first time directing for television. It featured guest appearances by Nigel Gibbs and stand-up comedian Bill Burr, the latter of whom specifically sought {{to appear on the}} show. The footage shown from <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> perspective of Gus' camera is actual footage from the real camera. Marie's return to the kleptomania she demonstrated in the first season was conceived early during brainstorming sessions for the third season.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} told in <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> through the protagonist, Elspeth Gordie, a teenage girl who has secret mental powers such as telepathy {{and the ability to}} {{communicate}} with animals. The story begins at Kindraide orphan home, where she and her brother Jes live, before moving briefly through Sutrium, the capital, and the countryside. However the majority of the narrative is set at Obernewtyn, which lies in the northern mountains of the Land, the fictional nation in which the Obernewtyn Chronicles is set.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E

5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the first}} Bond video game, {{developed}} {{and published by}} Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, the Atari 5200, the Atari 800, the Commodore 64 and the ColecoVision. Since then, {{there have been numerous}} video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>first-person</b> shooter video game GoldenEye 007 was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on the 1995 Pierce Brosnan film GoldenEye.
