40|$|Despite, huge {{developments}} {{in the field of}} production of medicines in India, essential medicines are still out of reach of millions of people in India; one important reason being shortage of essential medicines in Public Health Facilities (PHF). These shortages have been occasionally documented. For example, a survey published in 2007 of PHFs in six states revealed that the median availability of a core list of 30 essential medicines in these PHFs was 0 % to 30 %. 1 Recent surveys (see an example below) indicate that even after four years of NRHM, government has failed to keep its promise of ensuring availability of essential medicines in the rural PHFs. Unavailability of medical officer or other staff, callous attitude of staff, lack of cleanliness, non-availability of basic diagnostic tests in the facility, etc have led to reduced utilization of PHF. Shortage of essential medicines has become an additional cause for people’s reluctance to seek treatment from the PHF. There are many implications of this shortage of medicines. For example, people are forced into unwarranted out of pocket expenditure and consequent indebtedness. This tragedy of medicine-shortage is due to inadequate budgetary allocation towards medicines and inappropriate procedures for medicine procurement and distribution system etc. Like other states, Maharashtra also suffers from this problem. Several instances of corruption in <b>tendering,</b> delayed payments <b>to</b> <b>suppliers,</b> delayed distribution are directly linked with loopholes in the medicine purchase and distribution system. Hence, to understand this issue in depth, SATHI conducted an in depth study of Maharashtra’s medicine procurement and distribution system.
