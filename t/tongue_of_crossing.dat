This logo features {{the outline of the}} UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university. From the <b>cross</b> <b>of</b> the Main Building emanate four <b>tongues</b> <b>of</b> fire that spell out U, S, and T. The <b>tongues</b> <b>of</b> fire reference the future of the university, some ideals, and are reminiscent of the stripes of the Tiger, the school's mascot.
