Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) is a transcription factor that had seven sites predicted <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the promoter, four of which had a Matrix similarity - optimum score of {{greater than or equal}} to 0.085 and the two highest scoring transcription factors predicted were NRF1 with scores of 0.204 and 0.199.|$|E
50|$|An underbucking tool can be {{made using}} an ax driven {{into the side of}} the log so that a {{crosscut}} saw can be turned upside down. Underbucking is called that because a sawyer will cut the suspended log from the underside of the log, upwards. Cutting from the top of a suspended log will cause the log <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the saw blade as the log sags at the cutting point. Cutting from below will cause the cut to widen as the log sags, avoiding binding on the saw blade.|$|E

50|$|Polysialic acid is {{an unusual}} posttranslational {{modification}} that occurs on neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM). Polysialic acid is considerably anionic. This strong negative charge gives this modification the ability to change the protein's surface charge and binding ability. In the synapse, polysialation of NCAM prevents its ability <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> NCAM's <b>on</b> the adjacent membrane.|$|R

50|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is used in}} heavy duty punches as it is less likely <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> reset than the Sweet mechanism, it doesn't tend to wear {{the inside of the}} body as much as the Sweet mechanism and, because the end of the hammer can be used to provide impact on a larger area of the punch tip, reduces the stress on the material. The primary disadvantages are that there are more parts than in the Sweet design, and that both the hammer and the block require manufacturing other than on a lathe.|$|E
50|$|Proteins {{containing}} a POU region {{consist of a}} homeodomain and a separate, structurally homologous POU domain that contains two helix-turn-helix motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> {{opposite sides of the}} target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with consensus sequence 5'-ATGCAAAT-3'. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in bacteriophages, particularly lambda phage.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} for SR {{proteins}} to begin alternative splicing of an RNA transcript is for SR proteins <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) {{of the largest}} subunit of RNA polymerase II. The CTD is made of the conserved repeating heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS. Different steps of transcription have different levels of phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Before initiation of transcription, the CTD has low levels of phosphorylation, but it is subsequently hyperphosphorylated during initiation and elongation. The RS domain of SR proteins interacts with the hyperphosphorylated CTD during elongation of transcription.|$|E

5000|$|By the 18th century, such wagonways and tramways {{existed in}} a number of areas. Ralph Allen, for example, {{constructed}} a tramway to transport stone from a local quarry to supply the needs of the builders of the Georgian terraces of Bath. The Battle of Prestonpans, in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, was fought astride the 1722 Tranent - Cockenzie Waggonway. This type of transport spread rapidly through the whole Tyneside coalfield, and the greatest number of lines were {{to be found in the}} coalfield near Newcastle upon Tyne. They were mostly used to transport coal in chaldron wagons from the coalpits to a staithe (a wooden pier) on the river bank, whence coal could be shipped to London by collier brigs. The wagonways were engineered so that trains of coal wagons could descend to the staithe by gravity, being braked by a brakesman who would [...] "sprag" [...] the wheels by jamming them. Wagonways on less steep gradients could be retarded by allowing the wheels <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> curves. As the work became more wearing on the horses, a vehicle known as a dandy wagon was introduced, in which the horse could rest on downhill stretches.|$|E
30|$|The {{optimization}} of the APTES and GLU {{levels to}} use on the PS surface was performed with the targeted HIV p 24 antigen. To decide the suitable concentrations of APTES and GLU, the ELISA surface was first activated by 1 % potassium hydroxide for 10 [*]min. Then, three different amounts of APTES (0.5, 1, and 2 %) were allowed <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the ELISA surface, and they were incubated overnight at room temperature (RT). After that, two different amounts of GLU (1 and 2 %) were applied to the amine-modified PS surface. At that point, HIV-p 24 at a 250 -nM concentration was allowed <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the GLU-modified surface, and the remaining GLU surface was blocked with 2 % BSA. The p 24 antibody was introduced at a 1 : 1000 dilution, and then anti-mouse IgG-HRP was allowed to bind to the p 24 antibody. Finally, these interactions were monitored by adding the substrate (3, 3 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) for HRP. After the optimal amount of substrate (100 [*]mM) was added, the absorbance was read with an ELISA reader at 405 [*]nm. Control experiments were performed {{in the absence of}} target HIV-p 24.|$|E

50|$|Since many bHLH {{transcription}} {{factors are}} heterodimeric, their activity is often highly {{regulated by the}} dimerization of the subunits. One subunit's expression or availability is often controlled, whereas the other subunit is constitutively expressed. Many of the known regulatory proteins, such as the Drosophila extramacrochaetae protein, have the helix-loop-helix structure but lack the basic region, making them unable <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> DNA <b>on</b> their own. They are, however, able to form heterodimers with proteins that have the bHLH structure, and inactivate their abilities as transcription factors.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the interaction between}} apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ceramide (CER) -enriched domains on the particles, by using lipid emulsions containing sphingomyelin (SM) or CER as model particles of lipoproteins. The sphingomyelinase (SMase) -induced aggregation of emulsion particles was prevented by apoE. CER increased the amount of apoE bound to emulsion particles. The confocal images of CER-containing large emulsions with two fluorescent probes showed three-dimensional microdomains enriched in CER. SMase also induced the formation of CER-enriched domains. We propose apoE prefers <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> CER-enriched domains exposed on particle surface, and thus inhibits the aggregation or fusion of the particles...|$|E
40|$|Systems {{with two}} species of active {{molecular}} motors moving on (cytoskeletal) filaments into opposite directions are studied theoretically using driven lattice gas models. The motors can unbind from and rebind to the filaments. Two motors are more likely <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> adjacent filament sites if they {{belong to the same}} species. These systems exhibit (i) Continuous phase transitions towards states with spontaneously broken symmetry, where one motor species is largely excluded from the filament, (ii) Hysteresis of the total current upon varying the relative concentrations of the two motor species, and (iii) Coexistence of traffic lanes with opposite directionality in multi-filament systems.

Studying {{the binding}} requirements of Leishmania amazonensis leishporin, {{we have shown}} that protease-treated erythrocytes are as sensitive to leishporin-mediated lysis as untreated cells, indicating that protein receptors are dispensable. Similarly, carbohydrate receptors {{do not seem to}} be needed, since several sugars do not inhibit leishporin-mediated hemolysis. Conversely, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), but not cholesterol, completely inhibits leishporin-mediated lysis. DPPC liposomes, with or without cholesterol, are lysed by leishporin and remove its lytic activity. Our results demonstrate that leishporin is a cholesterol-independent cytolysin that <b>binds</b> directly <b>to</b> phospholipids...|$|R

Our framework incorporates such regulations into the Lucas (1978) model and applies this to France where many labor laws start <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> firms with exactly 50 or more employees. Using data on the population of firms between 2002 and 2007 period, we structurally estimate the key parameters of our model to construct counterfactual size, productivity and welfare distributions. With flexible wages, the deadweight loss of the regulation is below 1 % of GDP, but when wages are downwardly rigid welfare losses exceed 5 %. We also show, regardless of wage flexibility, that the main losers from the regulation are workers (and to a lesser extent large firms) and the main winners are small firms...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{metabolism}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components in cell detoxification, and two enzymes, i. e. phase Ⅰdrug metabolism enzyme and phase Ⅱdrug metabolism enzyme, are involved in the process. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is an important phase Ⅱdrug metabolic enzyme, which, together with phase Ⅰdrug metabolic enzyme, may catalyze drugs to form high water-soluble products. Therefore, GST may counteract the lesions caused by endogenous and exogenous electrophilic substances, and play an important role in antitumorigenisis. The genes coding proteins that have GST activity constitute a super family, and distribute in at least 7 chromosomes. GST possesses many functions, and it is traditionally held that GST may counteract the lesions caused by endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds. Moreover, the over-expression of GST in tumor cells may mediate glutathione <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the substrates of anticancer drugs, accordingly leads to drug resistance of tumor...|$|E
40|$|The {{conformation}} of a neuropeptide, substance P (SP), in isotropic (q = 0. 5) acidic bicelles {{was investigated}} using two-dimensional NMR techniques. By the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross peaks between SP and long-chain lipid molecules SP was probed <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> the flat {{surface of the}} disc-like bicelles. Structural analysis of NMR data indicated that the helical conformation of SP extended to the C-terminal region of Leu 10 {{as well as in}} the mid-region from Pro 4 to Phe 8. As compared with the conformations of SP bound on the sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) or the dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles with curved surfaces, the surface curvature of the membrane mimics was found to be one of the major factors inducing the biologically relevant conformation of SP. The negative surface charge of the membrane is also a key factor inducing both the binding of SP on the membrane and its biologically active structure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} Cu 2 + ions, {{present in the}} mucosal bathing solution, on the {{transepithelial}} short-circuit current (Isc) and conductance (Gt) and on the blocker-induced noise of apical Na channels, was studied on the isolated ventral skin of the frog Rana temporaria. Cu 2 + effects were concentration-dependent, the full effect being reached at 50 μmol/l. Cu 2 + increased Isc and Gt; this effect was eliminated by high concentrations of amiloride (30 μmol/l) and of CDPC (150 μmol/l). Cu 2 + markedly reduced the corner frequency (fc) of the Na channel noise, while having virtually {{no effect on the}} fc of CDPC-induced noise. Cu 2 + reduces the association rate constant of amiloride to the Na channel to one third; this effect is interpreted as indicating competition between Cu 2 + and amiloride for the same (negatively charged) binding site on the channel, while CDPC appears <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>on</b> a different site...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{that include}} both {{experimental}} data and computational simulations (in silico) {{have increased in}} number because the techniques are complementary.
