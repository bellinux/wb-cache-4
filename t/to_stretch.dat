5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves.

5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.|$|E

After a lengthy illness, Liverpool defender Markus Babbel returned to the squad and was named as a substitute. Houllier deployed a 4–3–1–2 formation with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Dietmar Hamann as a midfield three and new signing, El Hadji Diouf positioned in a free role to begin with and as the game went on, moved to the right wing <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> Arsenal's defence.|$|E

5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E

5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} long enough <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> across continents while {{remaining}} {{only a few}} kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E

The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimid Caliphate {{originated}} in an Ismaili Shia movement launched in Syria by Abd Allah al-Akbar. He claimed descent through Ismail, the seventh Shia imam, from the Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. The Fatimid Dynasty {{is named after}} Fatimah. In 899 Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah became leader of the movement. He fled from his enemies to Sijilmasa in Morocco, where he proselytized {{under the guise of}} being a merchant. El-Mahdi was supported by a noble man named Abu Abdullah al-Shi'i, who organized a Berber uprising that overthrew the Tunisian Aghlabid dynasty, and then invited el-Mahdi to assume the position of imam and caliph. A new capital was established at Mahdia. The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include Sicily and <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> across North Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to Libya.|$|E

After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E

Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but picked him off and finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored on a home run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young. The next batter, David DeJesus, hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead, 4–1. Rangers reliever Alexi Ogando entered the game with one out and recorded the final two outs to end the inning.|$|E
