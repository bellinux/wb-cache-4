5|$|Featuring {{a compact}} bullpup design with an {{integrated}} reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance. Its design incorporates several innovations {{such as a}} unique <b>top-mounted</b> magazine and FN's small-caliber, high-velocity 5.7×28mm ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that <b>top-mounted</b> configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the <b>top-mounted</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is also {{equipped}} with a 12.7mm coaxial machine gun and a remote-controlled 7.62mm machine gun, whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62mm weapons for both their coaxial and top machine gun mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun and two <b>top-mounted</b> machine guns, one 7.62mm and one 12.7mm.|$|E

25|$|The German forces {{knew about}} the Soviet dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took {{measures}} to defend against them. An armored vehicle's <b>top-mounted</b> machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too {{low to the ground}} and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.|$|E
25|$|The RX {{was built}} on a unibody chassis. Its {{exterior}} design was not typical of existing four-door vehicles at its introduction. Among design features, the vehicle featured front triangular quarter-windows, door-mounted side mirrors, a rear liftgate with <b>top-mounted</b> spoiler, and translucent front and rear light covers with round lenses. The exterior color scheme was two-tone, with the bumper and lower body-side cladding a gray color. The RX 300 carried a drag coefficient of 0.36 C'd. The first-generation Lexus RX was built in Kyushu, Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Lewis gun (or Lewis {{automatic}} machine gun or Lewis automatic rifle) is a First World War-era {{light machine gun}} of US design that was perfected and mass-produced in the United Kingdom, and widely used by British and British Empire troops during the war. With its distinctive barrel cooling shroud and <b>top-mounted</b> pan magazine, the Lewis served {{to the end of}} the Korean War. It was also widely used as an aircraft machine gun, almost always with the cooling shroud removed, during both world wars.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a <b>top-mounted</b> wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
500|$|The RTG (abbreviated {{from the}} French Rame à Turbine à Gaz, or gas turbine train) model was an Americanized {{version of the}} French ANF T 2000 RTG Turbotrain (related to the {{prototype}} precursor to the very first TGV trainset, the TGV 001). The RTGs used European-style couplers (buffers and turnbuckles) between their cars, because they were built in France by ANF for French railways. Another change was the installation of <b>top-mounted</b> Nathan P1234A5 horns, {{a variation of the}} standard Nathan P5.

40|$|A high-gain mushroom-shaped {{dielectric}} resonator (DR) antenna for wideband wireless applications, featuring 65 % fractional bandwidth, is proposed. The antenna {{consists of}} a low-permittivity hollow cylindrical DR provided with a <b>top-mount</b> spherical cap lens and a metal reflector, excited by means of coaxial probes. Suitable shaping of lens and reflector yields high gain (exceeding 14 dBi) and limited back radiation. The proposed antenna features a broadside radiation diagram with stable radiation patterns and wideband impedance matching. Its potential applications include access points for indoor/outdoor wireless multimedia systems as well as satellite terminal receivers. CST Microwave Studio, implementing a fullwave locally conformal finite integration technique, is employed to design and characterize the antenna, while the singularity expansion method is adopted to express the antenna response to arbitrary excitation waveforms.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model to}} assess the energy performance of vapor compression [`]on-off' controlled refrigerators is presented herein. The model consists of first-principles algebraic equations adjusted with experimental information obtained from the refrigeration system under study. The experimental work consisted of controlling and measuring the system and component operating conditions in order to gather key information for the development and validation of the model. The methodology showed similar accuracy to that using more sophisticated dynamic simulation codes, but with lower computational costs. When compared to experimental data, the model predicted AHAM energy consumption tests within a Â± 5 % deviation band. A sensitivity analysis considering the number of tube rows in the condenser coil, the number of fins in the evaporator coil and the compressor stroke is also reported.

40|$|An industry/government Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was {{established}} to evaluate and test design concepts for a domestic refrigerator-freezer unit that represents approximately 60 % of the US market.

5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a <b>top-mount</b> dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|R
