40|$|Smoking {{prevalence}} for schizophrenic {{patients is}} higher than this for general population. More than 60 % of schizophrenic patients are current smokers, which contributes to excessive mortality in these patients. The reasons for high frequency of both smoking prevalence and heavy smoking in schizophrenic patients {{is thought to be}} at least partially related to enhancement of brain dopaminergic activity, which, in turn, results in behavioral reinforcement due to stimulant effects. Smoking stimulates dopaminergic activity in the brain by inducing its release and inhibiting its degradation. There is also evidence that cigarette smoking can reduce deficits relative to dopamine hypofunction in prefrontal cortex. Recent neuroimaging studies have further contributed the evidence of complex influences of cigarette smoking on brain dopaminergic function. It has been suggested that smoking may be an attempt by schizophrenic patients to alleviate cognitive deficits and to reduce extrapyramidal side-effects induced by antipsychotic medication. Cigarette smoke also increases the activity of CYP 1 A 2 enzymes, thus decreasing the concentration of many drugs, including clozapine and olanzapine. There is also evidence that smoking is associated with increased clearance of <b>tiotixene,</b> fluphenazine and haloperidol. Given the high frequency of smoking in schizophrenic patients, clinicians need to check smoking status in each patient. Schizophrenic patients who smoke may require higher dosages of antipsychotics than nonsmokers. Conversely, upon smoking cessation, smokers may require a reduction in the dosage of antipsychotics.

40|$|ABSTRACT Primary polydipsia, or {{psychogenic}} polydipsia, is {{a condition}} that results in considerable morbidity and mortality. In psychiatric patients, psychogenic polydipsia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion may cause hyponatremia. In the 1970 s, it was recognized that antipsychotics such as <b>tiotixene</b> and haloperidol could impair the excretion of a free water load. There are also several case reports of drug-induced hyponatremia in patients using atypical drugs suggesting that these probably can also impair water balance and induce hyponatremia. Case report and review of relevant literature are reported in this article. Psychogenic polydipsia is a common cause of hyponatremia among individuals with chronic mental illness. A case of severe hyponatremia caused by psychogenic polydipsia is described involving a female patient with an adult lifelong history of chronic mental illness diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder. After switching her antipsychotic medication to clozapine water ingestion was normalized as well as sodium levels and her psychotic symptoms improved. Primary polydipsia occurs commonly with schizophrenia and other mental diseases and can cause hyponatremia. PPD may present as an acute psychotic state or as inexplicable emergence of seizures. Appropriate, timely clinical assessment with special attention to thirst, fluid intake, and urine output is essential. Proper treatment may include drug withdrawal and fluid and saline restriction. Once corrected, some pharmacological agents can be tried. The article illustrates {{the importance of the}} diagnosis of psychogenic polydipsia given its electrolyte disturbances and life threatening situations...|$|E
