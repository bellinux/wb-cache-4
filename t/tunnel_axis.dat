The orientation of joints in different directions can form blocks liable to fall. The objective of this research project is to determine the degree of influence of joints' strike and dip orientation in tunneling. Field works related to this project was carried out at the Bogala Graphite Lanka Ltd. Tunnel mapping and other observations related to the project were made at 489. 6 m level in Bogata mine. Models were made with joint spacing of 15 mm with two joint sets (joint sets parallel to <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis</b> and joint sets perpendicular to <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis).</b> Tunnels were created with 90 mm diameter with dip angles of joints are 00, 300, 600,and 900. The tunnels models are loaded using UCS machine and observed the behavior of rock mass around the tunnels during loading. From the results the most preferable dip angle for the joint strike perpendicular to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis</b> would be the 900 and for the joint strike parallel to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis</b> would be 00...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{tunnelling}} {{projects have}} received {{a great amount of}} media attention due to settlement induced damage. Due to the simplified approach of existing risk assessment methods, a new assessment system is in development, which can account for three-dimensional structural aspects of buildings. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the influence of the position and geometry of masonry buildings on the development of damage, while undergoing tunnelling induced settlements. In line with previous research, three-dimensional finite element analyses are used as a tool to perform a parametric study. A parametric study consists of an evaluation of the parameters position, aspect-ratio, grouping and orientation. The position parameter is divided into three characteristics: the sagging zone, a combined settlement profile and the hogging zone. The aspect-ratio parameter is also divided into three characteristics: shallow buildings, square buildings and deep buildings. The grouping effect parameter also distinguishes three characteristics: small and large isolated buildings and grouped buildings. The orientation parameter includes seven different increasing angles of the building main axis with respect to the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>axis.</b> The maximum measured crack width in the buildings gives input for a classification of damage, according the system of Burland et al. (1977). An average trend in the damage classification indicates the sensitivity to tunnelling induced settlements of the parameters. Both during and after tunnelling, a position of the building in the combined settlement profile appears to be the most sensitive to differential settlements. Buildings far away from the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>axis</b> generally obtain no more than slight damage. Structures with a low aspect-ratio seem on average to obtain equal amounts of damage as buildings with an aspect-ratio of 1. Structures with a higher aspect-ratio are less affected, both during and after tunnelling. Grouping of the buildings seems to be an influential parameter. Small isolated buildings obtain far less damage than large or grouped buildings. In relation to the numerical analyses, the empirical Limiting Tensile Strain Method (LTSM) seems to overestimate the damage for an isolated small building, but underestimate the damage in large or grouped buildings. For buildings in the sagging zone, a building with a low orientation angle is the least sensitive to differential settlement, while the maximum measured crack width increases by increasing the angle. The difference in maximum crack width can grow to a factor 3. A building in the combined settlement profile or in the hogging zone displays opposite behaviour. Cases with low orientation angles are the most susceptible to damage, while increasing the angle to 90 degrees lowers the maximum measured crack width. The difference in results can grow up to a factor 2. Structural MechanicsStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{effects on}} shallow {{circular}} tunnels in soft ground {{have often been}} neglected {{based on the assumption}} that their response to earthquakes loading is relatively safe as compared to that of surface structures. Nevertheless, several example of recorded damage to underground structures for which seismic forces were not considered in the design can be quoted. In some cases, damage was associated with strong ground shaking and site amplification, which increased the stress level in the tunnel lining. Ovaling or racking deformations are mostly due to shear waves propagating perpendicularly to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis,</b> resulting in a distortion of the cross-section of the structure, while axial compression and extension, or longitudinal bending are due to shear waves propagating parallel or obliquely to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis.</b> Pseudo-static and simplified dynamic analyses enable to assess transient changes in internal forces during shaking. In the simplified methods, a tunnel structure is generally designed by imposing a displacement field to its boundary, as obtained from a site seismic response under free field conditions, and calculating the forces in the lining in an uncoupled manner. Axial and bending deformations are generated by the components of the seismic waves producing particle motion parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tunnel, respectively. Nevertheless, experimental evidences of permanent changes in internal loads in the tunnel lining would suggest that a full three-dimensional dynamic analysis including plastic soil behavior should be performed when modelling the dynamic interaction between the tunnel and the ground. In the paper three-dimensional numerical analyses were performed to simulate the response of circular tunnels subjected to different seismic loads acting in the transversal and in the longitudinal direction of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis.</b> The main purpose of this study was to provide a three-dimensional numerical model, which would allow the tunnel lining behavior and the displacement field surrounding the tunnel to be evaluated for different directions of seismic wave propagation...|$|E

Based {{on the results of}} the finite-element analyses, the paper proposes a simplified analytical method which gives reasonably accurate predictions of the magnitude of the water table rise via a closed-form analytical expression. It is shown that the predicted magnitude of the steady-state water table rise is proportional to the tunnel height and to the original hydraulic gradient in the direction normal to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis.</b> The predicted rise of the water table also depends on the depth of the tunnel below the original groundwater table. For uniform ground permeability, the predicted steady-state rise is independent of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer, while the time required for the water table to gradually rise and eventually reach the steady-state condition is obviously dependent on the permeability and storativity characteristics of the aquifer. For typical values of the hydraulic gradient (2 - 5 %), the predicted water table rise is in the order of 5 - 20 % of the tunnel height for tunnels located just below the original level of the water table...|$|E

The prediction of damages in buildings is usually based on the classical Gaussian profiles for the approximation of the subsidence trough and the equivalent beam method for modeling the response of building walls. Current available expressions refer to walls aligned transversally {{with respect to the}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis,</b> which usually represents the worst-case scenario. However, approximations must be done for other building alignments, since no analytical expressions are available for these cases. We propose a novel equation for the determination of the horizontal ground strain, which departs from the equations of the classical Gaussian settlement profiles. The novel formulation allows the application of the equivalent beam method in 3 D and the modeling of the tunnel advance. The results show significant variations of the estimated damage depending on the wall position with respect to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>axis.</b> The paper reviews also certain relevant aspects of building damage predictions, such as the influence area of settlements and the possible contribution of ground horizontal strain to damage reduction.
