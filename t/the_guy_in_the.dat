500|$|Rihanna filmed {{the music}} video for [...] "Rehab" [...] with Justin Timberlake at Vasquez Rocks Park, near Los Angeles, on October 22,2008. It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who directed the videos for Rihanna's 2008 singles [...] "Take a Bow" [...] and [...] "Disturbia". Photographs of the production were leaked on the same day. Tim Nixon of The Sun wrote that the [...] "red hot chemistry" [...] between Rihanna and Timberlake must have been difficult for their partners to watch. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said that Timberlake's partner Jessica Biel was [...] "said to be 'sick to her stomach' after seeing Rihanna wearing a revealing outfit while filming with Timberlake." [...] Timberlake told Access Hollywood, [...] "I’m <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, so I had to give them all insecurities about that. But yeah {{we had a great}} time, we goofed around at the shoot most of the time." [...] The video premiered November 17,2008, on MTV.|$|E

You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on Morse and Hunter's storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it’s just who Hunter is." [...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that kick up the backside to send her in that direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been much more a loyalist to <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. It might take Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E

Hopkins said, [...] "He's got a suntan. That's all... McNabb is <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, while everybody else is on the field... He's {{the one who got}} the extra coat.

2500|$|Phyllis Coates, like George Reeves, was {{a popular}} lead in B {{features}} of the period. For the TV series, Reeves asked that Coates receive equal star billing. Coates created a sharp, strong-willed Lois Lane, an enterprising reporter who tries to out-scoop Clark Kent. Jack Larson's Jimmy Olsen is a Daily Planet intern, often investigating some wrongdoing and usually being caught by the villains. He usually receives help from Superman {{in the nick of}} time. In the noir-like early episodes, Superman himself is seen as a semi-mysterious presence, unknown to many of the crooks ("Who's <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circus suit?" [...] asks a villain in [...] "The Riddle of the Chinese Jade"). Eventually, all the crooks knew exactly who he was (often with the bug-eyed exclamation [...] "SOOPAH-man!" [...] when he first appeared). The first season's episodes usually featured action-packed, dark, gritty, and often violent story lines in which Superman fought gangsters and crime lords. Many characters met their deaths in these episodes, some of them shown on screen.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kerry Condon, and Chris Evans reprise {{their roles}} as Pepper Potts, F.R.I.D.A.Y., and Steve Rogers / Captain America from {{previous}} MCU films, respectively. Rogers appears in public service announcements played at Parker's school. Jacob Batalon portrays Parker's best friend Ned, a [...] "complete gamer", whom Batalon described as [...] "the quintessential best guy, the best man, the number two guy, <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair" [...] for Parker. Marvel used Ned Leeds {{as a basis for}} the character, who does not have a last name in the script or film, but essentially created their own character with him. Carroll said that Ned and other characters in the film are composites of several of their favorites from Spider-Man comics, and while Ned may eventually wind up with the last name [...] "Leeds", it is not a guarantee. Laura Harrier portrays Liz, a senior, Parker's love interest, and Toomes' daughter, with a [...] "type-A" [...] personality. Tony Revolori plays Eugene [...] "Flash" [...] Thompson, Parker's rival and classmate. It was noted that the character is generally depicted as a white bully in the comics; the Guatemalan American actor received death threats upon his casting. Revolori worked hard [...] "to do him justice", as he is an important character to the fans. Rather than being a physically imposing jock, Thompson was re-imagined as [...] "a rich, smug kid" [...] to reflect modern views of bullying, by crafting him more into a social media bully and rival for Parker opposed to a jock; this depiction was largely informed by Holland's visit to The Bronx High School of Science. Revolori said that Thompson has to work hard to match Parker's intelligence, which is [...] "one of the reasons he doesn't like Peter. Everyone else seems to like Peter, so he's like, why don't they like me like they like him?" [...] Revolori gained [...] for the role.|$|E
6000|$|But I {{admit it}} is a {{disadvantage}} {{that they have}} not a saint or hero to crown in effigy as well as a traitor to burn in effigy. I admit that popular Protestantism has become too purely negative for people to wreathe in flowers the statue of Mr. Kensit or even of Dr. Clifford. I do not disguise my preference for popular Catholicism; which still has statues that can be wreathed in flowers. I wish our national feast of fireworks revolved round something positive and popular. I wish the beauty of a Catherine Wheel were displayed to the glory of St. Catherine. I should not especially complain if Roman candles were really Roman candles. But this negative character does not destroy the national character; which began at least in disinterested faith and has ended at least in disinterested fun. There is nothing disinterested at all about the new commercial fireworks. There is nothing so dignified as a dingy guy among the lights of Broadway. In that thoroughfare, indeed, the very word guy has another and milder significance. An American friend congratulated me on the impression I produced on a lady interviewer, observing, 'She says you're a regular guy.' This puzzled me a little at the time. 'Her description is no doubt correct,' I said, 'but I confess that it would never have struck me as specially complimentary.' But it appears that {{it is one of the}} most graceful of compliments, in the original American. A guy in America is a colourless term for a human being. All men are guys, being endowed by their Creator with certain ... but I am misled by another association. And a regular guy means, I presume, a reliable or respectable guy. The point here, however, is that <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grotesque English sense does represent the dilapidated remnant of a real human tradition of symbolising real historic ideals by the sacramental mystery of fire. It is a great fall from the lowest of these lowly bonfires to the highest of the modern sky-signs. The new illumination does not stand for any national ideal at all; and what is yet more to the point, it does not come from any popular enthusiasm at all. That is where it differs from the narrowest national Protestantism of the English institution. Mobs have risen in support of No Popery; no mobs are likely to rise in defence of the New Puffery. Many a poor crazy Orangeman has died saying, 'To Hell with the Pope'; it is doubtful whether any man will ever, with his last breath, frame the ecstatic words, 'Try Hugby's Chewing Gum.' These modern and mercantile legends are imposed upon us by a mercantile minority, and we are merely passive to the suggestion. The hypnotist of high finance or big business merely writes his commands in heaven with a finger of fire. All men really are guys, in the sense of dummies. We are only the victims of his pyrotechnic violence; and it is he who hits us in the eye.|$|E
