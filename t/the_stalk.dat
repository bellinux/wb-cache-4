5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to <b>the</b> <b>stalk),</b> white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may the top of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> {{to the edge of}} the cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E

5|$|Pumping protons {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} {{creates a}} proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient. This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate– turning it into ATP.|$|E

50|$|The loser in the {{exercise}} appears to be <b>the</b> <b>stalking</b> horse. If <b>the</b> idea is viable or popular, <b>the</b> <b>stalking</b> horse person will be sidelined and the anonymous figure will take over the concept themselves. If the concept proves unpopular, <b>the</b> <b>stalking</b> horse will suffer any negative reaction. The understanding is that the anonymous party is a major player, perhaps only a little weaker than the target itself, and <b>the</b> <b>stalking</b> horse is a minor figure who {{has little or no}} reputation to lose. The anonymous figure is not sufficiently powerful, or does not have sufficient confidence in that power, to risk a direct attack first off, and <b>the</b> <b>stalking</b> horse is a form of distraction tactic to enable better positioning.|$|R
25|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>stalked</b> {{mucilaginous}} glands, <b>the</b> {{leaves are}} also equipped with sessile glands, which assumedly {{are responsible for}} the secretion of the digestive juices. Sessile glands are five to ten times as numerous as <b>the</b> <b>stalked</b> glands.|$|R
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> It {{is often described as}} inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E

5000|$|A corn {{harvester}} is a machine used on farms to harvest corn stripping <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> about one foot {{from the ground}} shooting <b>the</b> <b>stalks</b> through <b>the</b> header to the ground. The corn is stripped from its stalk and then moves through the header to the intake conveyor belt. From there it goes up the conveying system through a fan system, separating <b>the</b> remaining <b>stalks</b> from <b>the</b> ears. <b>The</b> <b>stalks</b> blow out <b>the</b> fan duct into the field while the ears drop onto another conveyor belt. The ears ride the belt and drop into a large moving bucket.|$|R

5|$|Leotia lubrica is {{the type}} species of the genus Leotia. It has been {{hypothesised}} that the species has {{a close relationship with}} L.atrovirens; mycologist Geoffrey Kibby suggested that greenish color of L.atrovirens may be due to infection by an imperfect fungus on L.lubrica, while David Arora proposed that the two species may intergrade. In 2004, results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that L.lubrica, L.atrovirens and L.viscosa, while morphologically well-defined, were not monophyletic. L.lubrica specimens could be split into at least two different groups, one of which also contained specimens of L.viscosa. These groups could be differentiated morphologically by the colour of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> when dried. The most basal was shown to be L.atrovirens.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family. It is known {{by a variety of}} common names, {{including}} the painted slipperycap, the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history, and is also frequently referred to Suillus pictus in the literature. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. <b>The</b> <b>stalk</b> bears a grayish cottony ring, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E

5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
5|$|The tambu is an instrument, and a form {{of music}} and dance found on Aruba, Bonaire (where it is {{sometimes}} known as bari), and Curaçao. The tambu is an especially important symbol of Curaçaoan identity. Instrumentation for the tambu uses the agan, chapi, triangle, wiri and other instruments, {{many of which are}} also part of the African-derived muziek di zumbi, or spirit music, of Curaçao. Curaçao's folk music also includes a rich tradition of work songs with apentatonic lyrics sung in Guene or a Papiamento variant called seshi. The Simadan harvest festival is found across the islands, and features the cachu trumpet, made from a cowhorn. Bonaire's Simadan festival is also notable {{for the use of the}} becu, an aerophone made from <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> of a sorghum plant, and the kinkon, made from a conch shell and known elsewhere as the carco. Folk song forms range from the harvest seu, simadan and wapa. Other songs were imported beginning in the 19th century, including the South American joropo and pasillo, Spanish Caribbean merengue and other new songs, dances and instruments. This diverse mixture was the origin of the Dutch Antilles' most distinctive and long-standing popular tradition, the tumba.|$|E

25|$|The way {{the gills}} {{attach to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> is an {{important}} feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do not extend {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stalk.</b> Others have decurrent gills that extend down <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet <b>the</b> <b>stalk,</b> and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>stalk</b> (or rafle) is the {{herbaceous}} branch {{that bears}} the grapes. It consists of about 80% water, soluble minerals (nearly 3% {{with half of}} potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste and the sensation of astringency. In the production of a white wine, <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> does not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins is not desirable in the wine. This is why it is quickly isolated {{from the rest of the}} harvest, either by shaking or by pressing.|$|E
25|$|Benign fatty tumors {{known as}} lipomas can {{form on the}} mesentery. As the tumor enlarges, it {{stretches}} the connective tissue into a stalk which can wrap around a segment of bowel, typically small intestine, cutting off its blood supply. The tumor forms a button that latches onto <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> of the tumor, locking it on place, and requiring surgery for resolution. Surgery involves cutting <b>the</b> <b>stalk</b> of the tumor, untwisting the bowel, and removing bowel {{that is no longer}} viable. If the colic is identified and taken to surgery quickly, there is a reasonable rate of success of 50–78%. This type of colic is most commonly associated with ponies, and aged geldings, 10 years and older, probably because of fat distribution in this group of animals.|$|E
