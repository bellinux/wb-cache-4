40|$|Abstract. ABO is {{the most}} {{clinically}} important blood group system in <b>transfusion</b> and transplantation <b>medicine.</b> The popular ABO genotyping methods, such as the sequencing of exons 6 and 7 and sequence-specific primer (SSP) -PCR, often lead to ambiguous typing results. Long PCR-sequencing method was designed to analyze two regulatory regions (promoter and CBF/NF-Y enhancer regions) and all genomic sequences (except for intron 1) of the ABO gene. Using rapid DNA polymerase with high-fidelity, we am-plified 6. 3 kb and 7. 3 kb for sequencing of enhancer-exon 1 and exons 2 – 7, respectively. ABO genotyping was performed using this technique in the peripheral blood of three unrelated families. The time require-ments of the PCR amplification and purification processes were about 2. 0 hours and 15 minutes, respec-tively. Five different ABO alleles (ABO*A 102, ABO*A 105, ABO*O 01, ABO*O 02, and ABO*B 101) with allele-specific CBF/NF-Y minisatellite repeats from three families were analyzed. All genotyping results agreed with serologic findings and results expected by Mendelian inheritance. Compared to conventional PCR-direct sequencing for ABO genotyping, this method proves simple and fast {{for the analysis of}} ABO genotypes. Therefore, it might be valuable in clinical transfusion or forensic applications...|$|R

40|$|Background/Case Studies: Donor {{granulocyte}} concentrates (GCs) {{are limited}} for broad application, mainly {{due to a}} short storage time of 6 ato 24 hours after donation, {{and they have to}} be prepared specifically for each patient, in compliance with blood group and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status. This storage period partially results from the high contamination (approx. 99 %) with RBCs and PLTs. We developed a closed-system method compatible with standard blood bank technologies to enrich the granulocytes and store them for longer periods. Study Design/Methods: GCs were prepared according to clinical standard procedures by apheresis in a medical blood bank. About 18 hours before apheresis, the donors were stimulated with steroids and G-CSF. These standard GCs were sedimented on hydroxyethylstarch, washed twice with 0. 9 % NaCl-solution, and resuspended in ABOidentical filtered plasma. Procedure was done in a closed multi-bag disposable system. These purified GCs (pGCs) were stored in platelet storage bags at a cell concentration of 5 x 107 leukocytes/mL without agitation at room temperature for up to 72 hours in 200 or 400 mL. Cell count and viability of the WBCs were tested daily. Phagocytosis and oxyburst were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results/Findings: The patented method resulted in a significant reduction of RBCs (98 %, by sedimentation) and PLTs (95 %, by washing) and in a highly purified WBC population and enrichment of granulocytes. In addition, the viability was significantly improved. Both the percentage of phagocytic and oxidizing PMNs as well as the phagocytic capacity remained stable (approx. 100 %). After 72 hours of storage, 94 % of the initial number of phagocytes remained. Furthermore, the viability of these cells improved significantly (0 hr: 86 %; 72 hr: 92 %), most probably due to phagocytosis of dead cells. Both, the percentage of phagocytic granulocytes and the phagocytosis intensity (mean fluorescence intensity due to ingestion of FITC-labeled E. coli) remained stable over the period of storage. After 72 hours, 96 % of the granulocytes were functional and showed unimpaired phagocytic intensity. Similar effects were observed in the oxyburst tests. Almost 100 % of the stored granulocytes were fully functional. Based on the results measured by flow cytometry and chemiluminscence, after 72 hours the oxyburst output of the stored granulocytes was comparable to the oxyburst level of the nonpurified GCs. Conclusion: By the improvement of the purification and storage methods and the resulting high purity of the granulocyte concentrates, an extension of application time from 24 to 72 hours can be achieved. Furthermore, all procedures of purification and storage of granulocyte concentrates can be done in a closed system compliant with GMP regulatory requirements. These two important facts may broaden the applicability of granulocyte <b>transfusions</b> in <b>medicine...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Hemoglobinopathies are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} disorders of hemoglobin synthesis. It could be formed a fatal scenario in concern of lacking of actual information. Beside this, ABO and Rh blood grouping are also important matter in <b>transfusion</b> and forensic <b>medicine</b> and to reduce new born hemolytic disease (NHD). Materials and Methods: The spectrum and prevalence of various hemoglobinopathies, ABO and rhesus (Rh) blood groups was screened among patients who visited B. S. Medical College and Hospital, Bankura, West Bengal, India. This study was carried out on 958 patients of different ages ranging from child to adults from January to June 2011. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), complete blood count (CBC) and hemagglutination technique were performed {{for the assessment of}} abnormal hemoglobin variants, ABO and Rh blood groups, respectively. Results: Results from this study had been shown that there was high prevalence of hemoglobinpathies (27. 35 %) where β-thalassemia in heterozygous state occurred more frequent than other hemoglobinopathies. Out of 958 patients, 72. 65 % were HbAA and 27. 35 % were hemoglobinopathies individuals where 17. 64 % β-thalassemia heterozygous, 2. 92 % β-thalassemia homozygous, 3. 86 % HbAE, 1. 15 % HbAS trait, 1. 25 % HbE-β thalassemia trait and 0. 52 % HbS-β thalassemia trait were found. No incidence of HbSS, HbSC, HbCC, HbD and other variants of hemoglobinpathies were observed. The gene frequencies with respect to ABO systems had been shown as O > B > A > AB. Blood group O was the highest (35. 8 %) and the least percentage distribution was blood group AB (6. 68 %). Rhesus positive (Rh+) were 97. 7 %, while the remaining was 2. 3 % Rhesus negative (Rh-). The frequencies of A +, B +, AB +, and O + blood groups were 22. 44 %, 33. 61 %, 6. 58 %, and 35. 07 %, respectively. Conclusions: Remarkable percentages of hemoglobinopathies were prevalent from the present study. An extensive screening of the population is needed to assess the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies, which will help in identification of carriers of hemoglobinopathies and further it will be of assistance in taking adequate therapeutic and preventive measures...|$|R

To ensure the efficacy of transfused PLTs, they must be stored at room temperature. Due to this storage requirement, PLTs have a short shelf life compared with other blood components of up to 5 – 7 days {{to minimize the risk}} of bacterial contamination. This short shelf life can lead to PLT shortages at times of increased demand or reduced supply and also higher wastage due to expiry. Increasing the PLT storage duration has the potential to improve PLT availability at times of altered demand or supply. However, in addition to the risk of bacterial contamination, functional and biochemical changes occur in PLTs and their storage medium during storage that may lead to PLT activation, changes in efficacy, and adverse events. This narrative review analyzes the issues around PLT inventory management and potential risks of stored PLTs. Although in vitro studies show accumulation of reactive biomarkers in PLT units, the clinical significance of these changes remains uncertain and there is currently no evidence for an association between PLT storage duration and adverse events. Furthermore, PLTs processed and stored for up to 7 days in defined conditions could be as safe as fresh PLTs. Large prospective studies are warranted to better evaluate the safety of PLTs with extended storage and to define the best practice of optimizing PLT inventory management while maintaining PLT transfusion safety.

40|$|The {{oral surgery}} {{procedures}} in oral anticoagulated patients {{has always been}} very controversial due to the dilemma between the high risk of haemorrhage versus the possibility of embolism should the oral anticoagulated treatment be suspended. The risk of thromboembolism depends on several factors, including the clinical indications for anticoagulation. Various protocols have been suggested for treating these patients, including substituting heparin for oral anticoagulants, decreasing the level of anticoagulation preoperatively, temporarily stopping the oral anticoagulants, and not altering the anticoagulant regimen at all. The first goal of this doctoral thesis was to emphasize the clinical preparation (clinical and laboratory examinations) of oral anticoagulated patients before oral surgery procedures. The main objective was to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to perform safe oral surgery on oral anticoagulated patients without having to suspend treatment beforehand. The second goal was to compare three local agents that aid haemostasis, following minor oral surgery in therapeutically anticoagulated patients. The study was performed over a five-year period (2002 - 2006) and elaborated in the Clinic for oral surgery, Faculty of dentistry, Skopje. A longitudinal study was performed in oral anticoagulated treatment patients that required some type of oral surgical procedures. In order to realize the aims of the investigation, 260 subjects have been examined. The indications for oral surgical interventions have been based on the findings of anamneses, extra-oral and intra-oral clinical examination, as well as, the findings and analyses of X-ray examinations. According to the thrombotic diagnosis, 240 patients were divided into four groups: each one of 60 subjects. The group of 20 healthy subjects served as a control group.
