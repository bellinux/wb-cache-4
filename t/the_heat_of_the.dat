5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to reduce the heat island effect. In cities, there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.|$|E

5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E

The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for statehood. A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade of a giant elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land.

Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised {{from the floor and}} individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E

5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
5|$|The championships {{were held}} on 16 October 2010. The women's race began at 8:30am local time (GMT+8) and the men's {{competition}} began {{half an hour}} after this. In addition to the elite races, a complementary mass fun run event of 10km and 4km was held {{for the people of}} Nanning (beginning at 9:15am).

5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded.

A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower decks of a ship.

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
