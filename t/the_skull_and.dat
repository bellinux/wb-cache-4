5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of <b>the</b> <b>skull)</b> <b>and</b> diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the skull, join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of the skull in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|Parrots {{are small}} to large birds with a {{characteristic}} curved beak.

5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> <b>and</b> can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just {{over half of}} all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E
5|$|Believing she {{has finally}} lost her sanity, Jenni {{resolves}} to be committed. She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E

5|$|Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew tenrec from southeastern Madagascar. It {{is known}} only from two partial skulls found in Andrahomana cave, which {{radiocarbon}} dating of associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old. It {{is the only}} known recently extinct tenrec. First described in 2007, it is most similar to the smaller Microgale brevicaudata of northern and western Madagascar. M.macpheei has a broad rostrum (front part of <b>the</b> <b>skull)</b> <b>and,</b> like M.brevicaudata, lacks a diastema (gap) between the premolars. A number of details of tooth morphology are characteristic of M.macpheei.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> <b>and</b> the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E

5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> <b>and</b> end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
