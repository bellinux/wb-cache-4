50|$|<b>The</b> kewda <b>flower</b> and its rooh, {{produced}} after processing <b>the</b> <b>flowers,</b> is also {{unique to}} <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> grows {{in at least}} four coastal blocks of the district - Chhatrapur, Rangeilunda, Ganjam and Chikiti. The Kewda oil is extracted by processing <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> in distilleries. Around 250 processing units, locally known as bhatis, were engaged in processing <b>the</b> <b>flowers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pollinators {{have not}} been observed, and <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> period is brief when {{compared}} with other banksias. However, the flowers appear when little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source for animals.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith's reign is {{considered}} the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted {{until the end of}} the 8th century. The period saw <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> of Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions to the continent.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{red-headed}} myzomela {{is widely}} distributed, {{it is not}} abundant within its range. The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E
50|$|The female beetle lays its eggs in <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> buds of <b>the</b> host-plant and {{the larvae}} develop within <b>the</b> <b>flowers.</b> Oviposition and feeding damage the buds of oilseed rape and similar Brassicas and may cause <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> to drop.

5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most {{commonly}} used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 1800s, Venance Payot, a Chamonix naturalist, {{published}} {{a number of}} articles on the flora around the Mont Blanc area, including a list of <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plants, ferns mosses and lichens found at les Grands Mulets {{and elsewhere in the}} massif around Chamonix and the Aosta Valley.|$|E

5|$|The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid {{progress}} {{in establishing a}} modern monophyletic classification of <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plants by 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the Liliaceae family, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} need for a {{thorough}} revision of the taxonomy of <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plants (angiosperms), systematists formed the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998. The scheme was largely {{based on the work of}} Kåre Bremer and colleagues at Uppsala and Stockholm universities in the late 1970s, and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, justifying this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores.|$|E
50|$|O'Keeffe {{experimented with}} {{depicting}} flowers in {{her high school}} art class. Her teacher explained {{how important it was}} to examine <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> before drawing it. So, O'Keeffe held it in different ways, capturing different perspectives of <b>the</b> <b>flowers,</b> and also created studies of only a portion of <b>the</b> <b>flower.</b> During this process she also drew <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> simpler with each iteration.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flower</b> brings {{fortune to}} the person who finds it. In various {{versions}} of the tale, <b>the</b> fern <b>flower</b> brings luck, wealth, or the ability to understand animal speech. However, <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> is closely guarded by evil spirits and anyone who finds <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> will have access to earthly riches, which have never benefited anyone, so the decision to pick <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> or leave it alone is left up to the individual.|$|R
5000|$|Hibiscus syriacus, {{also known}} as the Korean Rose, is <b>the</b> {{national}} <b>flower</b> of South Korea. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> appears in national emblems, and Korea is compared poetically to <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> in <b>the</b> South Korean national anthem. <b>The</b> <b>flower's</b> name in Korean is mugunghwa (Hangul: 무궁화; Hanja: 無窮花). <b>The</b> <b>flower's</b> symbolic significance stems from the Korean word mugung, which means [...] "eternity" [...] or [...] "inexhaustible abundance". Various emblems of South Korea contain hibiscus syriacus.|$|R
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

50|$|The {{rhododendron}} is <b>the</b> national <b>flower</b> of Nepal, where <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> {{is considered}} edible and enjoyed for its sour taste. <b>The</b> pickled <b>flower</b> {{can last for}} months and <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> juice is also marketed. <b>The</b> <b>flower,</b> fresh or dried, is added to fish curry {{in the belief that}} it will soften the bones. The juice of rhododendron flower is used to make a squash called burans (named after <b>the</b> <b>flower)</b> in <b>the</b> hilly regions of Uttarakhand. It is admired for its distinctive flavor and color.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> are {{arranged}} in heads or short spikes up to 65 mm in diameter and contain 10 to 20 groups of <b>flowers</b> in threes. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> appear in September and are green, fading to yellow. The petals are 5.1-7 mm long and fall off as <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> matures. <b>The</b> stamens {{are arranged}} in bundles of five around <b>the</b> <b>flower,</b> with 7 to 12 stamens in each bundle. The base of <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> is hairy and 2.8-4.6 mm long. The woody capsules are 3.7-5.6 mm long.|$|R
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> of his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|Today, New South Wales waratahs {{are grown}} commercially in Australia north of Sydney {{and in the}} Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, {{where they have been}} grown since 1961. One major {{challenge}} in commercial production is that in any one location <b>the</b> <b>flowering</b> season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flower</b> is dull {{purple and}} {{streaked}} with purple-brown. Pointed lobes curl {{away from the}} mouth of <b>the</b> <b>flower,</b> revealing a hairy yellow sterile stamen known as a staminode. <b>The</b> <b>flower</b> is up to 2 centimeters in length.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> {{are around}} 5 cm in diameter, are yellow in colour and {{normally}} have ten petals. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> open {{in late afternoon}} and close in <b>the</b> morning. <b>The</b> <b>flowers</b> are hermaphrodite and flower from July to August.|$|R
50|$|The bracts in the {{inflorescence}} form effective {{shelters for}} <b>the</b> <b>flowers</b> from rain, their red-violet color enhances the signal effect of <b>the</b> <b>flowers.</b> <b>The</b> shaggy hairiness of the calyx protects <b>the</b> <b>flower</b> against small, crawling insects. The nectar is additionally secured by a stiff, upturned hair ring.|$|R
