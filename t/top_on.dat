5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting <b>top</b> <b>on</b> the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the new Skyway Monte Bianco cable car on the Italian side of the massif {{is expected to increase}} visitor numbers to Courmayeur from 100,000 to 300,000 per annum, following complete replacement of an earlier cable car system in 2015.

Snowdon is hidden by the Coniston Fells, and the Isle of Man is largely hidden behind the Great Gable and Pillar group of fells.|$|E

5|$|With the {{previous}} season's inconsistencies behind him, Stivetts was re-signed {{and was the}} team's starting pitcher for Boston's season-opening game on April19; a 13–2victory versus the Bridegrooms of Brooklyn. He then lost his next eight starts, however, before beginning a ten-game winning streak that lasted into mid-July. On August21, he started and gained complete game victories in both ends of a doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds. Two days later, on August23, he pitched Boston to a 12–10victory against the Spiders. That same day in Ashland, his father {{was killed in a}} coal mining accident when a load of coal fell on <b>top</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), the boyfriend of her sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper). Mercedes discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Tony's child {{and plans to}} have an abortion. Jacqui discovers the affair and asks Mercedes if she can raise the child herself, as she is unable to have children. However, Mercedes has an abortion anyway. Mercedes has a brief relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and is upset to learn that he is having an incestuous affair with his half-sister, Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan). Mercedes and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) make a bet: Darren has {{to have sex with}} Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), and if he does Mercedes promises to have sex with him. Darren accompanies an intoxicated Hannah home and takes a photo of her with no <b>top</b> <b>on.</b> Mercedes refuses to believe Darren, but sends the photo to Hannah's boyfriend, Danny Valentine (David Judge). Danny ends his relationship with Hannah and sleeps with Mercedes.|$|E
5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on <b>top.</b> <b>On</b> the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E

5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting <b>top</b> <b>on</b> the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the <b>top.</b> <b>On</b> Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.|$|E
5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct {{alignment of the}} colors, that is with the white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on <b>top.</b> <b>On</b> August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E

5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There {{he joined a}} group from the 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's <b>Top.</b> <b>On</b> Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, {{and at the top}} of Malone's Gulley were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E
