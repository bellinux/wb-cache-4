The aim of the paper was to analyse and compare beekeeping sectors between Slovakia and Romania in terms of honey production, market competitiveness and EU funding budget allocation. The secondary data used in <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> by European Commission reports, the Romanian Institute of Statistics, Slovak statistics, Central Register of Hives in Slovakia, Faostat and Trademap. The competitiveness in honey market was calculated using RCA indices and the Michaely index.

In conclusion, national beekeeping programmes provide financial support for beekeepers and foster the whole sector, therefore the European Union should continue implementing these programmes to stabilize this sector and increase production capacities in both countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper was to conduct a safety analysis of the Cardinal Greenway rail-trail based upon standard trail design, maintenance, and management techniques. The analysis examined indirect safety issues including trail design, vegetation and surface maintenance, and signage. Direct safety issues, such as medical emergency management and crime prevention techniques, were also examined. Trail safety analysis forms were designed {{for use in the}} safety evaluation. This safety analysis was intended to provide a comprehensive analysis from the perspective of an independent consultant. The analysis was very subjective at times. Due to the subjective nature of the analysis and related forms, the analysis was not to be completed by trail management. The safety analysis forms were created to examine the unique characteristics of linear and urban park trails and are not intended for use in the park/forest setting. This type of analysis would be applicable to rail-trails and similar trails throughout the United States. The Cardinal Greenway is a multi-county, rail-trail project based in Muncie, Indiana. Cardinal Greenway, Inc, a private, non-profit organization, manages the privately owned trail. The results of <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> to Cardinal Greenway management, along with recommendations for trail safety improvement.

40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed {{to present the}} {{evolution}} of the allocated subsidies in the Republic of Moldova towards different subsidizing directions and an analysis of its efficiency. The data used in <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> by the Agency of Interventions and Payments in Agriculture, National Bureau of Statistics, as well as own carried research concerning the activity of agricultural enterprises. The data have been processed towards the subsidized directions in the last years, and had been analyzed the allocation of subsidies per hectare to different groups of agricultural enterprises by the following indicators: gross agricultural product per ha, profit per ha, level of profitability, as well as by regions. During the analyzed period, the amount of allocated subsidies had increased. The allocated amount of subsidies to the agricultural enterprises demonstrates that in 2008 - 2010 only 214 of them received a subsidy higher than 650 lei per ha allowing them to obtain a profit of 1845 lei per ha and a level of profitability of 35 %. As well, in 2012 have decreased the number of subsidized directions comparing to the previous year, being excluded some of the directions, as the subsidizing the purchasing of fertilizers and plant protection materials which are needed in the adverse weather conditions (as the drought from the fall of 2011 and winter frosts in 2012). As a conclusion, the subsidizing policy is needed {{for the development of the}} agricultural sector and therefore it should make incentives for the efficient enterprises activities, and as a result for the whole efficiency of the agricultural sector...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of basic demographic components (population structure, mortality and modern immigration) in Greece, in the framework of the Demographic Transition Theory; particularly, for {{the second half of the}} 20 th century. The dissertation seeks to provide answers to two fundamental questions: a) Does demographic behaviours converge at the administrative level of Prefecture, as expected according to the Demographic Transition Theory?, and b) Was, the massive inflow of foreigners at the end of century, capable to lead to demographic inversions by altering the population age pyramid structure to a more juvenile one? The data used for <b>the</b> <b>analysis,</b> <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG). Classic demographic methods were applied in order to derive all the necessary conclusions. However, they had not been applied again to Greek data, and/or to data of a lower administrative level. The results of the analysis lead to a positive answer for the first posed question, concerning the national level, as well as the Prefectures. Both spatial levels are characterised by common attitude from a balance of high mortality and fertility towards a new, low rate of birth and large life expectation. At the lower spatial level, this realisation is reflected to the sum of demographic pyramids, which changed their shape from a “juvenile” form, at the beginning of the 20 th century into aging population in the dawn the 21 st century; followed by significant increase of survival rates at the mortality tables. As far as, the second question is concerned, the derived results revealed that foreigners influenced the sex and age distribution of the total country population, although they did not present the critical size or an extreme demographic behaviour, in order to be able to alter the inclination of Greek population towards ageing. Finally, this dissertation is able to pose and inspire new inquiring questions, in terms of future research, in various conceptual levels as it constitutes an innovative effort into a relatively new scientific field for our country. ...|$|E
