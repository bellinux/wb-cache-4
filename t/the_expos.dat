5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated <b>the</b> <b>Expos</b> to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E
