5000|$|Later that year, after Dune was {{permanently}} canceled {{with him}} definitively returning to France, Giraud {{became one of}} the founding members of the comics art group and publishing house [...] "Les Humanoïdes Associés", together with fellow comic artists Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Philippe Druillet (likewise Pilote colleagues) and (outsider) financial director Bernard Farkas. In imitation of the example set by the L'Écho des savanes founding editors, it was therefore as such also an indirect result of the revolt these artists had previously staged at Pilote, and whose employ they had left for the undertaking. Together they started the monthly magazine Métal hurlant ("Screaming metal") in December 1974, and for which he had temporarily abandoned his Blueberry series. The <b>translated</b> <b>version</b> <b>was</b> known in the English-speaking world as Heavy Metal, and started its release in April 1977, actually introducing Giraud's work to North-American readership. Mœbius' famous serial [...] "The Airtight Garage" [...] and his groundbreaking [...] "Arzach" [...] both began in Métal hurlant. Unlike Hara-Kiri and L'Écho des savanes though, whose appeal has always remained somewhat limited to the socially engaged satire and underground comic scenes, it was Métal hurlant in particular that revolutionized the world of Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées, whereas its American cousin left an indelible impression on a generation of not only American comic artists, but on film makers as well as evidenced below.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Translation, {{cultural}} adaptation, {{and validation}} of the {{new version of the}} Knee Society Score - The 2011 KS Score - into Brazilian Portuguese and verification of its measurement properties, reproducibility, and validity. In 2012, the new version of the Knee Society Score was developed and validated. This scale comprises four separate subscales: (a) objective knee score (seven items: 100 points); (b) patient satisfaction score (five items: 40 points); (c) patient expectations score (three items: 15 points); and (d) functional activity score (19 items: 100 points). METHOD: A total of 90 patients aged 55 - 85 years were evaluated in a clinical cross-sectional study. The pre-operative <b>translated</b> <b>version</b> <b>was</b> applied to patients with TKA referral, and the post-operative <b>translated</b> <b>version</b> <b>was</b> applied to patients who underwent TKA. Each patient answered the same questionnaire twice and was evaluated by two experts in orthopedic knee surgery. Evaluations were performed pre-operatively and three, six, or 12 months post-operatively. The reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two applications. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: The ICC found no difference between the means of the pre-operative, three-month, and six-month post-operative evaluations between sub-scale items. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian Portuguese version of The 2011 KS Score is a valid and reliable instrument for objective and subjective evaluation of the functionality of Brazilian patients who undergo TKA and revision TKA...|$|E
