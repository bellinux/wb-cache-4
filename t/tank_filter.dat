5000|$|A {{plate and}} frame filter press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports of a pair of rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the {{plate and frame filter}}. For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter <b>tank.</b> <b>Filter</b> cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the plate and frame filter press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experimental}} septic <b>tank</b> <b>filter</b> {{fields were}} constructed with built-in monitoring equipment in Nixa soils. These soils contain many chert fragments and a fragipan about 60 cm deep which restricts downward water movement {{and is the}} design-limiting feature. The standard filter field (76 cm deep) was built into the fragipan and the modified standard filter field (30 cm deep) was placed above it. During 30 months 2 ̆ 7 observation, the modified standard performed better than the standard filter field. Maximum rise of effluent in the standard and modified standard came within 11 and 19 cm of the soil surface, respectively. Performance of these systems indicates filter fields should be designed to function during climatic stresses, i. e. when the soil has a maximum hydraulic load and surfacing may occur. Filter fields should be designed to withstand a stress period of specified intensity. The filter fields {{in this study were}} observed under less than normal stress. Therefore, their long range performance is less clear. Our observations indicate that filter field performance is related more to rates of water movement than to stone content. Major influences on filter field performance are rates and directions of water movement, stress period intensity, designs, and construction techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{domestic}} wastewater treatment {{in term of}} bacterial removal using conventional septictank in many developed towns is lack of land to purify domestic sewage into 10 m minimum safety distance according to WHO regulation. It is necessary to develop new treatment system to ensure bacterial will be removed 100 percent less than 10 m distance. Channel System Filter Septictank (CSF Septictank) is designed {{to solve the problem}} above. CSF Septictank is a common septictank equipped with filter tank separated by several partition walls to shape channels. CSF will consist of three parts: initial storage <b>tank,</b> <b>filter</b> tank and final storage tank. The Filter tank is fully filled with fine sand as filter medium. Wastewater will flows from the initial storage tank then pass the filter tank and entering the final storage tank as product of CSF Septictank treatment. Dimensions of the filter tank are analyzed using Huisman formula. Performance of CSF Septictank is measured by comparing water quality between water in the initial storage tank and the final storage tank. Water quality test result shows significance effect in bacterial removal. The other parameters also show increasing of water quality. By using CSF Septictank, bacterial contents could be removed 99, 15 %, BOD 5 contents decreases 27, 24 %, COD contents decreases 29, 01 % meanwhile DO contents increases 27, 78...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of post-primary treatment components of on-site wastewater management systems is critically {{dependent on the}} loads imposed upon them, in particular those of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and total suspended solids (TSS).

40|$|Treatment {{of water}} {{has a great}} {{influence}} {{on the use of}} water for domestic use both in rural and urban areas. Slow sand filtration involves the use of beds of sand for the filtration of water. The reason for designing slow sand filter for rural water treatment is to make treatment of water easy and qualitative. This research involves the use of three <b>tanks,</b> <b>filter</b> beds, filter media and filtrate tanks. Raw water is filtered by the layers of different sand particles, and conveyed by pipe after filtration to the filter media that has diatomite as the sieving agent which filters the water before been conveyed into the filtrate tank. From test carried out, the result shows that slow sand filter with filter technology is moderately efficient for water treatment. The design of slow sand filter technology applied appropriate technology; hence the ease of filtering raw water as well as improvement in taste and odor of water being treated was achieved.
