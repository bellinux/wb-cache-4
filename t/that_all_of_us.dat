25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.|$|E

Similarly, The New Yorkers Anthony Lane said the film could still end up [...] "bleached of fun" [...] due to the theme mooted in The Matrix <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are being controlled.

[...] He concluded some people may call it entertaining, but he [...] "felt [...] like Pop fascism". Jim Emerson, editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote that Speed Racer [...] "is a manufactured widget, a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products".

The collection of sketches called Pechersky Antics was written in December, and published by Kievskaya Starina, in its February and April issues. By this time a large Russian Antics cycle began to take shape, in which Leskov implemented, as he saw it, Nikolai Gogol's idea (formulated in the Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends) of [...] "extoling modest working men." [...] "It is wrong and unworthy to pick out the worst in the soul of the Russian man, so I embarked on my own journey looking for virtuous ones.

A similar cycle of short stories involved legends of early Christianity, with plot lines taken from the [...] "prologues" [...] and Byzantine stories of the 10th and 11th centuries. The fact that some of these pieces ("Pamphalone", [...] "Beautiful Azu") were translated into German and praised by publishers, made Leskov immensely proud. What was new to the Russian reader in them was, as Mirsky noted, [...] "a boldly outspoken treatment of sensual episodes"; some critics accused the author of [...] "treating his moral subjects as nothing but pretexts for the display of voluptuous and sensual scenes." ...|$|E

If you had any idea of the work <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions."

This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected.

[...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity."
