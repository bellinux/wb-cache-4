The study examined who <b>community</b> <b>college</b> faculty members believe is responsible for teaching various information literacy concepts. The study analyzed <b>community</b> <b>college</b> faculty responses related to information literacy skills. Research was conducted in accordance with the Association of College and Research Libraries’ information literacy framework and measured the importance of specific information literacy skills from the perception of faculty. A cross sectional design used quantitative survey methods modeled after Gullikson’s significant research on faculty perceptions. The study results indicate <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> faculty view all information literacy dispositions as important, and implementing information literacy concepts is a shared responsibility between <b>community</b> <b>college</b> faculty and librarians. Subtle variances between different categories of survey respondents were recorded. The findings may be used to shape recommendations to improve, evaluate, and implement information literacy at the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> level. <b>Community</b> <b>colleges</b> need to adopt information literacy as an institutional goal while providing financial support and policies that encourage partnerships between librarians and faculty, require assessment of information literacy initiatives.

The survey of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisors included a possible 942 respondents; 371 participated for a response rate of 39 %. Respondents rated the 48 job competencies for their priority and frequency of use. Using an expert panel, survey research, and exploratory factor analysis as the method of analysis, this study establishes a job competency model <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisors and leaders can utilize in recruitment and selection, job performance and evaluation, and professional development. The <b>community</b> <b>college</b> advisor competency model is a three-factor solution that summarizes and groups competencies into interpretable clusters. The competencies clusters for priority and frequency are: 1. 	student centered; 2. 	advisor centered; 3. 	institution centered. These distinct categories of competencies, when applied to complete advising duties, are likely to lead to achieving crucial outcomes, such as successful student completions. The three-factor solutions for priority and frequency were compared with the three competencies clusters as suggested by Boyatzis (2011) —cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence, social intelligence. Each competency was found to require a blend of emotional, social, and cognitive intelligences. However, the student, advisor, and institution centered factors can be compared to social, emotional, and cognitive intelligences, respectively. In addition to a job competency model, this research offers highest rated priority and frequency of use competencies to consider in recruitment and selection and professional development.

50|$|Scholars {{recommend}} <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> {{can enhance}} their remedial education programs through utilizing {{a variety of}} methods.

The institution of learning communities at community colleges may be challenging {{due to the nature of}} these students coming to and leaving campus often, but they have been helpful for remedial students at other postsecondary educations in facilitating friendships, improved studying patterns, and higher rates of passing courses. Technology-enhanced classrooms, complete with SmartBoards, computers and online networks, can increase the level of motivation that remedial community college students place toward their academic work. Remedial students obtaining academic assistance via college writing centers can also be helpful for enhancing their skills, as well as observing the interdisciplinary nature of classroom concepts and learning strategies.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{valuation}} process of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> library end-users as they decide which information resources to use when conducting research. This study was designed as an exploratory study using Q methodology and focused on five specific information resources <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> library end-users routinely use in their research process: the Internet, the reference librarian, books, newspapers, and subscription databases. Little is known about the valuation hierarchy that end-users overlay on these resources when deciding which ones to use to address a specific research need. Sixty-four <b>community</b> <b>college</b> library end-users from four main campuses of a large <b>community</b> <b>college</b> sorted 40 statements describing specific value statements pertaining to the information resources under study. The statements were sorted along a continuum ranging from least like me (- 4) to most like me (+ 4) with 0 representing an opinion of neutrality. Following these procedures, five factors emerged that represented different perspectives on value relating to the five information resources under study. Interpretation of these factors yielded distinct patterns of opinion relating to the perceived value of each information resource. These factors were named: (a) Browsers, (b) Proficient, (c) Vacillators, (d) Bibliophiles, and (e) Traditionalists. The results of the study suggest <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> library end-users value, to varying degrees, all five of the information resources selected for this study. The results also suggest that while the Internet has become a dominant information resource in the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> library end-user 2 ̆ 7 s research process, other more traditional information resources such as the reference librarian, books, and, to a lesser extent, newspapers still hold value in the research process.

Discriminant analysis results yielded statistically significant differences in the academic success and persistence of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer and native student graduates and dropouts. On average, native students graduated with twice as many lower level credit hours and cumulative credit hours than <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfers. Discriminant analysis results did not yield appreciable differences in the final grade point averages of student graduates, indicating <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer students performed just as well academically as native students.

These findings support the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> students are as academically capable as native students but may benefit from services that promote student engagement. The qualitative component provided a context for enhancing the interpretation of quantitative findings and for addressing the structure of articulation services, availability of transfer student services, compliance with the statewide articulation agreement, and advocacy of transfer students on each campus.
