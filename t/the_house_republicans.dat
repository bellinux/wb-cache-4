5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans,</b> he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
25|$|As Speaker, he {{was still}} the leader of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> However, by tradition, he {{normally}} did not take part in debate, although {{he had the right}} to do so, and almost never voted from the floor. He was not a member of any House committees during his Speakership.|$|E
25|$|The scandal led to Foley's {{resignation}} from Congress on September 29, 2006. In some quarters, {{the scandal}} {{is believed to}} have contributed to the Republican Party's loss of control over Congress in the November 7, 2006 election, as well as the end of House Speaker Dennis Hastert's leadership of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Kirk Fordham, chief of staff to Rep. Tom Reynolds and former chief of staff for Foley, also resigned {{as a result of the}} scandal.|$|E

50|$|After the 2008 elections, he {{was chosen}} as chief deputy {{minority}} whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Conference. His predecessor, Eric Cantor, was named minority whip. On November 17, 2010, he was selected by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Conference to be <b>the</b> <b>House</b> majority whip in the 112th Congress. In this post, he was <b>the</b> third-ranking <b>House</b> <b>Republican,</b> behind <b>House</b> speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor.|$|R
50|$|Lankford {{defeated}} Democrat Tom Guild with 59 {{percent of}} the vote. Following the election, he was named chairman of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Policy Committee, <b>the</b> fifth-ranking position in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus. This is a very senior position for a second-term House member.|$|R
25|$|As Southerners {{resigned}} {{their seats}} in the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>Republicans</b> were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the Morrill Tariff, land grant colleges (the Morrill Act), a Homestead Act, a transcontinental railroad (the Pacific Railway Acts), the National Banking Act and the authorization of United States Notes by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The Revenue Act of 1861 introduced the income tax to help finance the war.|$|E
25|$|Thompson, a Republican, {{was elected}} to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1910. He was one of two House members elected to {{represent}} District 21, a very large, rural district which included Crook (at that time, Crook County included what is now Crook, Deschutes and Jefferson counties), Grant, Klamath, and Lake counties. After he was elected, Thompson announced he would run for Speaker of the House, one of three legislators seeking that post. In <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>Republicans</b> outnumbered Democrats 58 to 2, so the struggle for speaker was between various factions of the Republican Party. As the leader of the conservative Republican bloc in the House (a group Oregon newspapers called the Old Guard), Thompson made a very strong run for the speaker position. Ultimately, he fell short of the votes he needed and threw his support behind John P. Rusk. His support gave Rusk the votes necessary to be elected speaker, though two House members still voted for Thompson.|$|E
500|$|As Voorhis {{served his}} fifth term in <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{searched for a}} {{candidate}} capable of defeating him. Local Republicans formed {{what became known as}} the [...] "Committee of One Hundred" [...] (officially, the [...] "Candidate and Fact-Finding Committee") to select a candidate with broad support in advance of the June 1946 primary election. [...] This move caused some editorial concern in the district: The Alhambra Tribune and News, fearing the choice of a candidate was being taken away from voters in favor of a small group, editorialized that the committee formation was [...] "a step in the wrong direction" [...] and an attempt to [...] "shove Tammany Hall tactics down our throats".|$|E

2500|$|After the Republicans {{lost control}} of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader. [...] While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.|$|E
2500|$|On November 19, 2008, Cantor was {{unanimously}} elected Republican Whip for the 111th Congress, {{after serving}} as Deputy Whip for six years under Blunt. Blunt {{had decided not to}} seek reelection to the post after Republican losses in the previous two elections. Cantor was the first member of either party from Virginia to hold the position of Party Whip. As Whip, Cantor was the second-ranking House Republican, behind Minority Leader John Boehner. [...] He was charged with coordinating the votes and messages of Republican House members. Cantor became the Majority Leader when the 112th Congress took office on January 3, 2011. [...] In this position, he remained second-in-command to Boehner, who was considered the leader of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, the Speaker is {{reckoned}} as {{the leader}} of the majority party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For instance, when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader. [...] Despite this, Cantor and his successor, Kevin McCarthy, have been reckoned as the second-ranking Republicans in the House, since Boehner is still reckoned {{as the leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> However, there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006. [...] In contrast, the Minority Leader is the undisputed leader of the minority party.|$|E

2500|$|The Republicans won a {{majority}} in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about [...] "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream". November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> as their nominee for Speaker, all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011. [...] He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on Wednesday, January 5, 2011. He was the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883). He was also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.|$|E
2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner {{has the right to}} say them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think that we want to take this to the ultimate end and put that chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close to maybe not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E
