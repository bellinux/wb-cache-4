5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> If the resident spider eventually leaves <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> but {{waits for the}} prey to move out, and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>nested</b> {{universal}} relation (UR) model aims {{to provide}} logical data independence to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> relational model by allowing users {{to view the}} database {{as if it were}} composed of a single nested relation. Moreover, non-technical users may find <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> relational model too complex to interact with, a problem we call herein the usability problem. <b>The</b> <b>nested</b> UR model solves the usability problem by allowing users to interact with <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> database without having to know its detailed structure, which may be complex. In order to formalise <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model we extend the weak instance approach to the (classical) UR model to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model. <b>The</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach leads naturally to the definition of the underlying data structure for <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model, namely <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> representative instance (NRI) over <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> universal relation scheme. We present two different definitions of the NRI and show that they are equivalent. First, we define the NRI declaratively as the greatest lower bound of <b>the</b> set of <b>nested</b> weak instances with respect to a natural ordering defined on nested relations. Second, we define the NRI constructively as the result of computing the extended chase on <b>the</b> underlying <b>nested</b> database. Finally, we show that the weak instance approach to the UR model is a special case of <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model, thus allowing us to implement a flexible UR interface by using <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model; this provides us with all <b>the</b> advantages of <b>nested</b> relations over flat relations...|$|R

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> is being built to watch for predators. <b>The</b> <b>nest</b> is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks.

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> the queen tends to be the most active individual in <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized.

5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> at an early age. In most species, chicks leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E

50|$|Colonies are {{founded by}} swarming; a young queen {{and a small}} {{fraction}} of workers leave <b>the</b> mother <b>nest</b> for a new nest site. Before swarming, scout bees explore suitable cavities in the area surrounding <b>the</b> mother <b>nest.</b> This scouting often lasts between two days and two weeks. <b>The</b> new <b>nest</b> sites are within a few hundred meters of <b>the</b> mother <b>nest</b> to allow continued contact with <b>the</b> mother <b>nest,</b> which can last from a week up to six months for T. angustula, which is longer than many other bee species.

5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents.

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> by raising their tail {{to the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> to prevent other birds from entering <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E

5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree.
