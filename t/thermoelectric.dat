5|$|Bismuth {{telluride}} is a semiconductor and {{an excellent}} <b>thermoelectric</b> material. Bi2Te3 diodes are used in mobile refrigerators, CPU coolers, and as detectors in infrared spectrophotometers.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has made}} use of {{technologies}} such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope <b>Thermoelectric</b> Generator (MMRTG), which {{is a type of}} Radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generator used on space missions. Shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions {{since the turn of the}} millennia. An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s {{brought an}} {{increase}} in <b>thermoelectric</b> applications for tellurium (as bismuth telluride), and in free-machining steel alloys, which became the dominant use.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s {{extended}} {{mission is}} expected to continue until around 2025 when its radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators will no longer supply enough electric power to operate its scientific instruments.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{has been}} used in the {{radioisotope}} <b>thermoelectric</b> generators of unmanned spacecraft such as the Voyager, Viking, Pioneer, Cassini, Galileo, and New Horizons. Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the plutonium-238 fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000°C and for its great strength.|$|E
5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting <b>thermoelectric</b> generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Nextreme was {{spun off}} of RTI {{to develop a}} <b>thermoelectric</b> {{material}} for semiconductors commercially. RTI acquired a healthcare marketing firm called MasiMax in March 2009. It also created another semiconductor startup that year called SiXis. In 2011 RTI created the Center for Agricultural and Environmental Biotechnology and in 2012 it acquired a California-based education research firm, MPR Associates.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium, {{which is}} a {{semiconductor}} in its standard state, is used mainly as a component in type II/VI semiconducting-chalcogenides; these have applications in electro-optics and electronics. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency, low manufacturing costs, and large band gap of 1.44 eV, letting it absorb {{a wide range of}} wavelengths. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), alloyed with selenium and antimony, is a component of <b>thermoelectric</b> devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistivity in samarium monochalcogenides {{can be used}} in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low-resistance and high-resistance state by external pressure, and such devices are being developed commercially. Samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about 150°C that can be applied in <b>thermoelectric</b> power converters.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators.|$|E
5|$|These {{characteristics}} make it well-suited for {{electrical power}} generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime. It is therefore used in radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators and radioisotope heater units {{such as those}} in the Cassini, Voyager, Galileo and New Horizons space probes, and the Curiosity Mars rover.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{has three}} {{radioisotope}} <b>thermoelectric</b> generators (RTGs) {{mounted on a}} boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power {{at the time of}} launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time (due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples), but the craft's RTGs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing <b>thermoelectric</b> generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in flow {{caused by}} dams, diversions, water for <b>thermoelectric</b> power stations, and {{evaporation}} losses from reservoirs – {{the latter of}} which consumes more than 15percent of the river's natural runoff – has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at {{only a fraction of}} its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a <b>thermoelectric</b> generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermoelectric</b> {{materials}} are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The <b>thermoelectric</b> effect relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as {{the driving force}} to establish a gradient in electrical potential {{is driven by the}} entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the <b>thermoelectric</b> literature, the term band structure engineering refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near the Fermi level. More specifically, <b>thermoelectric</b> {{materials are}} intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at the Fermi level, resulting in high electronic entropies. Instead of engineering band filling, one may also engineer the shape of the band structure itself via introduction of nanostructures or quantum wells to the materials.|$|E
25|$|Methods of {{refrigeration}} can {{be classified}} as non-cyclic, cyclic, <b>thermoelectric</b> and magnetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of the crystal structures of rare-earth borides results in interesting physical properties and potential applications in thermopower generation. Thermal conductivity of boron icosahedra based compounds is low because of their complex crystal structure; this property is favored for <b>thermoelectric</b> materials. On the other hand, these compounds exhibit very low (variable range hopping type) p-type electrical conductivity. Increasing the conductivity is a key issue for <b>thermoelectric</b> applications of these borides.|$|E
25|$|Ideal <b>thermoelectric</b> {{materials}} {{have a high}} Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. Low thermal conductivity is necessary to maintain a high thermal gradient at the junction. Standard <b>thermoelectric</b> modules manufactured today consist of P- and N-doped bismuth-telluride semiconductors sandwiched between two metallized ceramic plates. The ceramic plates add rigidity and electrical insulation to the system. The semiconductors are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel.|$|E
25|$|A Multi-Mission Radioisotope <b>Thermoelectric</b> Generator, {{left over}} {{as a backup}} part for Curiosity during its construction, will power the rover.|$|E
25|$|Two new CCGT plants, the José de San Martín <b>Thermoelectric</b> and Manuel Belgrano <b>Thermoelectric,</b> of 830 MW each, {{are under}} {{construction}} {{and expected to}} start full operations {{at the beginning of}} 2009. Endesa, Total S.A., AES Corporation, Petrobras, EDF and Duke Energy are the main shareholders in the plants. Both plants, which have been financed through the FONINVEMEM (total investment amounts up to US$1,097 million), are expected to start full operations at the beginning of 2009.|$|E
25|$|A {{radioisotope}} <b>thermoelectric</b> generator (RTG) is {{a simple}} electrical generator which converts heat into electricity from a radioisotope using an array of thermocouples.|$|E
25|$|The Nicrosil and Nisil {{thermocouple}} alloys show greatly enhanced <b>thermoelectric</b> stability {{relative to}} the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the <b>thermoelectric</b> instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.|$|E
25|$|Some designs might {{contain a}} {{radioisotope}} <b>thermoelectric</b> generator using Pu-238 {{to provide a}} long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 Liping Liu, Associate Professor at Rutgers University, envisioned an OTEC {{system that}} utilises the solid state <b>thermoelectric</b> effect {{rather than the}} fluid cycles {{traditionally}} used.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} {{is expected to}} operate {{for at least one}} Earth year, and its instruments might be powered by a radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generator to provide long-term power.|$|E
25|$|No {{moving parts}} allow {{continuous}} operation for many years. Tellurex Corporation (a <b>thermoelectric</b> production company) claims that thermoelectrics {{are capable of}} over 100,000 hours of steady state operation.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive decay {{has been}} used on a {{relatively}} small scale (few kW), mostly to power space missions and experiments by using radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators such as those developed at Idaho National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermoelectric</b> cooling {{uses the}} Peltier effect {{to create a}} heat flux between the {{junction}} of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments.|$|E
25|$|Another {{benefit of}} some {{renewable}} energy technologies, like {{wind and solar}} photovoltaics (PV) is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas <b>thermoelectric</b> (fossil fuel based) power plants require vast amounts of water for operation.|$|E
25|$|The Voyager Golden Record is {{attached}} {{to one of the}} bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The three radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators (RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom.|$|E
25|$|Both China and the Soviet Union {{immediately}} sent technicians into North Korea {{to repair}} or re-build lost generators. For {{much of the}} summer of 1952 only approximately 10% of former energy production was restored, primarily by its <b>thermoelectric</b> plants.|$|E
25|$|Already, caesium-137, strontium-90 and a {{few other}} {{isotopes}} are extracted for certain industrial applications such as food irradiation and radioisotope <b>thermoelectric</b> generators. While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it can reduce the quantity of waste produced.|$|E
