The oldest tea {{specialty}} book in Japan, Kissa Yōjōki (extra=How to Stay Healthy by Drinking Tea), was written by Eisai. The two-volume book was written in 1211 after his second and last visit to China. The first sentence states, [...] "Tea is the ultimate mental and medical remedy and has the ability to make one's life more full and complete."

Kūkai is also the first to use the term [...] (chanoyu), which later came to refer specifically to the Japanese tea ceremony. Upon their return to Japan, Kūkai and Saichō founded the Shingon and Tendai schools of Buddhism, respectively.

50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of testosterone buciclate {{in an aqueous}} suspension {{has been found to}} produce physiological levels of testosterone within the normal range in hypogonadal men for 3 to 4 months. The elimination half-life and mean residence time (average amount of time a single molecule of drug stays in the body) of testosterone buciclate were found to be 29.5 days and 60.0 days, respectively, whereas those of testosterone enanthate in castor oil were only 4.5 days and 8.5 days. Testosterone buciclate also lasts longer than testosterone undecanoate, which has elimination half-lives and mean residence times of 20.9 days and 34.9 days in <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil and 33.9 days and 36.0 days in castor oil, respectively. In addition, there is a spike in testosterone levels with testosterone enanthate and testosterone undecanoate that is not seen with testosterone buciclate, with which levels stay highly uniform and decrease very gradually and progressively.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas the {{terminal}} half-life of unesterified testosterone administered via intramuscular injection is very short at only around 10 minutes, {{the terminal}} half-lives of intramuscular testosterone esters are far longer. Administered {{in the form}} of oil solutions, the terminal half-lives are 0.8 days for testosterone propionate, 4.5 days for testosterone enanthate, 20.9 days (in <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil) and 33.9 days (in caster oil) for testosterone undecanoate, and 29.5 days for testosterone buciclate. Although exact values are not available for intramuscular testosterone cypionate, its pharmacokinetics are said to be the same as those of testosterone enanthate, with [...] "extremely comparable" [...] patterns of testosterone release. Due to their varying and different terminal half-lives, the different intramuscular testosterone esters are administered with differing frequencies. Testosterone propionate is injected two to three times per week, testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate are injected once every two to four weeks, and testosterone undecanoate and testosterone buciclate are injected once every 10 to 14 weeks. Due to its relatively short duration, testosterone propionate is now relatively little used and testosterone undecanoate is the preferred testosterone ester for intramuscular use. Testosterone undecanoate and testosterone buciclate can be injected intramuscularly as little as four times per year.|$|E
40|$|Amendment of infested BVB NO. 4 {{peat moss}} medium with 2 % (w/v) <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace was {{significantly}} effective in inhibiting 68 % colonization of cabbage seed by Rhizoctonia solani AG- 4. The results were observed first {{immediately after the}} amendment was applied and second on the 7 (superscript th) day after the treatment. In the greenhouse study, <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace amended {{at the rate of}} 1 % (w/v) was also able to obviously reduce the disease incidence of cabbage seedling damping-off by 40 % compared to untreated control. The pH values of BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium did not change significantly after <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace was amended at the rate of 1 % (w/v); however, <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace was able to stimulate the proliferation of microbial populations including fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. The inhibition of cabbage seed colonization was not significantly nullified in autoclaved BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium with <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace. The results suggest that the inhibition of cabbage seed colonization by the pathogen in the amended medium might be due to the presence of chemical compounds with antifungal activity in <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace. 採用種子誘釣法篩選具有抑制Rhizoctonia solani纏據甘藍種子效果的有機添加物，結果發現在BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中添加 2 % (w/v) 苦茶粕處理第 0 天（當天）即可降低種子纏據百分率達 68 %；處理一星期後，亦可得到類似的效果。栽培介質添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕可顯著降低甘藍苗立枯病的發病率達 40 %。進一步，探討苦茶粕添加於BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中的其他效應，結果發現添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕不會顯著改變BVB No. 4 泥炭苔的pH值，但却會提高微生物的族群量，其中細菌菌量增加 9 倍，真菌及放線菌則分別增加 2 ~ 3 倍。經高溫高壓滅菌後，去除BVB No. 4 泥炭苔及苦茶粕中的微生物，發現苦茶粕尚能降低R. solani AG- 4 纏據甘藍種子百分率達 30 %以上。本研究結果顯示苦茶粕的組成份中可能存在有抑菌化學物質，可有效抑制本病原菌纏據甘藍種子...|$|E
