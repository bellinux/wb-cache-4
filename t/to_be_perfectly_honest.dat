Are you seriously {{claiming}} no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, {{have you had a}} look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{decision}} to continue playing Test level rugby Campese writes that, [...] "In the end, my decision to play on was taken with one overriding goal in mind. I wanted to end my Test career on a high note. Not with an appearance off the bench in a Bledisloe Cup loss to the All Blacks." [...] He further adds that, [...] "the prospect of playing 100 Tests had enormous appeal too… But, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the initial aim was just {{to get back in}} the starting side." [...] Campese was selected for the Australian team for the first eight Tests of their 1996 season, before being dropped following his 100th Test against Italy. He would play one more Test for Australia against Wales in the Wallabies final Test of the year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is all}} explained," [...] said he, hurriedly. [...] "I can't {{touch on}} that. My affair is this: The captain sent me with the letter, and I have <b>been</b> <b>to</b> {{a lot of trouble}} to get it to you. Now, he <b>is</b> not going <b>to</b> pay me for all this,--if he thanks me, it will be more than I expect,--and I <b>am</b> going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> open and <b>honest</b> with you, and say that as the captain won't pay me, I expect you to do it; or, putting it in another way, before I hand you the letter I brought you, I want you to make me a {{handsome}} present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> hard <b>to</b> {{speak to}} you in this way," [...] he answered, [...] "and the only way in which I can do it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{straightforward}} and <b>honest</b> about it. I am at heart a literary man, and have, so far as I have the power, cultivated the art of putting things effectively; and I assure you, sir, that it gave me actual pain when I found how you <b>were</b> going <b>to</b> present some of the incidents of your journey, such as, for instance, your diving experiences in the maelstrom, {{or at least in}} the place where it <b>was</b> supposed <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and where, judging from your discoveries, it may under certain conditions and to a certain extent really exist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because in {{this matter}} you have been his chosen friend,--and mine. We have told you everything, trusting to you. We have {{believed}} in your honour. We have thought that with you, at any rate, we were safe." [...] These words <b>were</b> very bitter <b>to</b> Phineas, and yet when he had written his letter at Loughton, he had intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> chivalrously honest! Now Lady Laura spoke to him {{and looked at him}} as though he had been most basely false--most untrue to that noble friendship which had been lavished upon him by all her family. He felt that he would become the prey of her most injurious thoughts unless he could fully explain his ideas, and he felt, also, that the circumstances did not admit of his explaining them. He could not take up the argument on Violet's side, and show how unfair it would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> her that she should be debarred from the homage due to her by any man who really loved her, because Lord Chiltern chose to think that he still had a claim,--or at any rate a chance. And Phineas knew well of himself,--or thought that he knew well,--that he would not have interfered had there been any chance for Lord Chiltern. Lord Chiltern had himself told him more than once that there was no such chance. How <b>was</b> he <b>to</b> explain all this to Lady Laura? [...] "Mr. Finn," [...] said Lady Laura, [...] "I can hardly believe this of you, even when you tell it me yourself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Kloh, I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> with you. I've had {{word from}} your wife. She's unhappy, and she loves and admires {{you more than}} any other man in the world, and I think she would come back--misses the child so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Either {{that boy}} <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> {{or else he}} is the most {{accomplished}} actor I ever saw," [...] thought the merchant when left alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the first}} speaker said, [...] "that is {{certainly}} an uncommon experience. You {{think that if}} I <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I should envy him his experience? Well, then, honestly, I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think," [...] she said at last. [...] "I don't {{know what to}} make of you--brother Chris. I thought, do you know? that you <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest.</b> And somehow--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must change}} my ground altogether. I can't pretend any longer {{to be the}} {{contemporary}} of my lovers, or to have the least sympathy with their hopes and fears. If I were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> with them, I should tell them, perhaps, that disappointed love {{was the best thing}} that could happen to either of them, but, if they insisted on happiness, that a good broken engagement promised more of it than anything else I could think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} tactless about it," [...] he assured her. [...] "It {{makes it much}} {{easier for me to}} tell you. I married my wife {{thirteen}} years ago because I believed that her wealth would help me in my career. She married me because she was an American with ambitions, anxious to find a definite place in English society. She has been disappointed in me. Other circumstances have now presented themselves. I have discovered that my wife's affections are bestowed elsewhere. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the discovery was a relief to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, for {{the first}} time, I told him that I was in a but very little better position; and I am bound to say that, {{notwithstanding}} his own infatuation, he had the decency to sympathise with me. Perhaps {{he did not think}} it worth while being jealous, realising that he had no cause so far as the lady was concerned. I went on to suggest that we should try to run away, but we soon rejected the project as futile, and, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I do not believe that either of us would really have left Ayesha even if some superior power had suddenly offered to convey us from these gloomy caves and set us down in Cambridge. We could no more have left her than a moth can leave the light that destroys it. We were like confirmed opium-eaters: in our moments of reason we well knew the deadly nature of our pursuit, but we certainly were not prepared to abandon its terrible delights.|$|E

5000|$|In his introduction, {{which is}} {{probably}} the most interesting thing in the book, James wrote that these plays were designed to be mostly mindless: [...] "a short comedy, the broader the better, thoroughly simple, intensely pleasant, affording a liberal chance to a young sympathetic comedian, calling for as little acting as possible besides, skirting the fairy-tale, straining any and every point for the agreeable falsity, entailing no expense in mounting, and supremely susceptible of being played to audiences unaccustomed to beating around the bush for their amusement - audiences, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> in country towns." ...|$|E

60|$|How Tom Jones {{combined}} these sentiments, which <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> {{with his}} own astonishing lack of retenue, and with Lady Bellaston, is just the puzzle.
