5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Inquiry</b> one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by <b>the</b> <b>Inquiry</b> during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. <b>The</b> <b>Inquiry</b> attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} <b>the</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the}} cause of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. <b>The</b> <b>Inquiry</b> led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. <b>The</b> <b>Inquiry</b> concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 1908, {{less than}} six weeks after <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> closed, the Local Government Board issued a draft {{provisional}} bill for the federation of the six towns. This was not unexpected but the rating scheme proposed differed from the schemes discussed during <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> and included a complicated valuation of the properties belonging to each municipality, something {{that none of the}} towns wished to carry out. Nevertheless, Hanley, Longton and Tunstall all supported the draft order while Stoke, Fenton and Burslem opposed it.|$|E

In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry, and another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year. By March 2017 <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> had cost £11.1 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. <b>The</b> <b>inquiry</b> concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> opened, a {{poll was}} {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>inquiry.</b> A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E

Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
