25|$|During World War II, {{the demand}} for nickel for the war effort was great enough for the 5¢ coin to be issued in <b>tombac</b> instead.|$|E
2500|$|The medal {{was secured}} to a gilt <b>tombac</b> 24,5mm wide x 16mm high {{rectangular}} mount by a ring through the suspension loop. The mount {{was covered by}} a scarlet silk moiré ribbon. [...] A gilt <b>tombac</b> laurel branch was affixed to the ribbon.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1943, a new five-cent {{piece was}} introduced. Due to the {{shortages}} of nickel, owing to its use for munitions, the Royal Canadian Mint adopted <b>tombac,</b> {{a type of}} brass for the five-cent piece. The composition of <b>tombac</b> was [...]880 copper and [...]120 zinc. The coin was twelve-sided, so that the public could easily distinguish it from the bronze cent. [...] Rather than the traditional beaver, the patriotic V for Victory (made famous by Winston Churchill) and a burning torch were now used. The coin was designed by Thomas Shingles, the Chief Engraver for the Royal Canadian Mint, and the coin’s rim holds a message in Morse Code that states: [...] "We win when we work willingly." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivated}} area constitutes only 5.6% of total land, while the arable land reaches 37% {{of the total}} area. The main products cultivated are olives, grains and tobacco. The Lebanese Reggie for Tobacco and <b>Tombacs</b> buys the entire tobacco production of the 22 farmers in the village. Oil, grains and other agricultural goods (tomatoes, cantaloupes, etc.) produced are sold in the village. Moreover, the production of honey is estimated at 500 kg, which is sold inside the village at LBP 20,000-30,000/kilo.|$|R
2500|$|A clasp, {{also known}} as a bar, is awarded for every 10 years of {{subsequent}} service. The bar is <b>tombac</b> and is [...] high, has the Canadian coat of arms in the centre surmounted by a crown, and is gold in colour. This is indicated on the undress ribbon bar by a rosette.|$|E
2500|$|World War II saw low mintages of most coins, as the metals (especially {{copper and}} nickel) were {{needed for the}} war effort. [...] The {{composition}} of the 5¢ coin was changed to <b>tombac</b> in 1942; and the design was changed to a V for Victory in 1943. The composition was changed again to nickel-chromium-plated steel in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The honorary title [...] "Honoured Navigator of the USSR" [...] was a 27mm wide by 23mm high {{silver and}} nickel polygon with raised edges. At {{the top of}} the obverse, the relief {{inscription}} in two lines covered to the left [...] "HONOURED NAVIGATOR" [...] (Russian: ЗАСЛУЖЕННЫЙ ШТУРМАН), in the center, the gilt <b>tombac</b> image of a jet transport aircraft climbing diagonally towards the right, at the bottom, the relief inscription [...] "USSR" [...] (Russian: СССР) superimposed over a laurel branch.|$|E
2500|$|The honorary {{title of}} [...] "Honoured Military Pilot of the USSR" [...] was a 27-millimetre-wide by 23-millimetre-high silver-and-nickel polygon with raised edges. At {{the top of}} the obverse, the relief {{inscription}} in three lines covered to the left [...] "HONOURED MILITARY PILOT" [...] (...) , in the center, the gilt <b>tombac</b> image of a jet plane climbing diagonally towards the right its nose and tail slightly protruding over the edges, at the bottom, the relief inscription [...] "USSR" [...] (...) superimposed over a laurel branch.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, {{the size}} of the 1¢ was reduced and the silver {{fineness}} of the 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins was reduced to 0.800 silver/.200 copper. [...] This composition was maintained for the 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ piece through 1966, but the debasement of the 5¢ piece continued in 1922 with the silver 5¢ being entirely replaced by a larger nickel coin. In 1942, as a wartime measure, nickel was replaced by <b>tombac</b> in the 5¢ coin, which was changed in shape from round to dodecagonal. Chromium-plated steel was used for the 5¢ in 1944 and 1945 and between 1951 and 1954, after which nickel was readopted. The 5¢ returned to a round shape in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The Honorary Title [...] "Honoured Inventor of the USSR" [...] was a 30mm in {{diameter}} gold-plated <b>tombac</b> circular medal. [...] On its obverse, a red enamelled five pointed star over {{a hammer and}} sickle and gears, the upper tip of the sickle becoming a missile in flight arcs around {{the right side of}} the star to a point at its upper left. [...] Following the left, top and right medal circumference, the relief inscription [...] "Honoured Inventor" [...] (...) , near the bottom, a red enamelled rectangle bearing the gilt inscription [...] "USSR" [...] (...) [...] [...] On the otherwise plain reverse, the relief inscription [...] ""Honoured inventor of the USSR - creator of scientific and technological progress" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Due to high {{demands for}} copper and zinc {{during the war}} effort, the use of <b>Tombac</b> was suspended. A new {{composition}} of steel with [...]0127mm plating of nickel and [...]0003mm plating of chromium became the norm. The plating process of these coins meant that strips had to be plated before blanks were punched out. The end result was that {{the edges of the}} blanks were unplated. Although the RCM returned to nickel after WWII, the Korean war effort resulted in the use of steel again in 1951. Some of the steel coins were later discovered to have only the nickel plating and had a grey rather than the usual [...] "bluish" [...] appearance. Until recently, this variety did not command a premium price from collectors, but the fact that some years are rarer than others has started to generate interest in this variety.|$|E
2500|$|The medal is decagonal (ten-sided, {{representing}} the ten provinces), 36 millimetres across the flats, with raised busts. The King George VI medal is [...]800 fine silver and gilded. The Queen Elizabeth II medal is <b>tombac</b> (a copper-zinc alloy) A gilded copper version {{was introduced in}} 2008. The King George VI medal has the uncrowned coinage head of King George VI, facing left, with the inscription GEORGIVS VI D: G: BRITT: OMN: REX FID: DEF around the edge. The Queen Elizabeth II medal has the uncrowned coinage head of Queen Elizabeth II, facing right, with the inscription around the edge ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA with the word CANADA at the bottom. The reverse of the medal has a crown, three maple leaves and an eagle {{representing the}} navy, army and air force from top to bottom. The word SERVICE is on a scroll at the base and a fleur-de-lis is {{on each side of}} the crown. The Royal Cypher is superimposed on the centre of the King George VI medal, but is omitted from the Queen Elizabeth II medal. The King George VI medal has the name and rank of the person to whom the medal was awarded to engraved on the reverse of the solid bar while the Queen Elizabeth II medal has the name and rank engraved around the edge of the medal. Early Queen Elizabeth II medals had the letters stamped rather than engraved.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 1942 <b>tombac</b> coins, the nickel was made dodecagonal, presumably to help {{distinguish}} it from the cent after it tarnished in circulation. <b>Tombac</b> {{was removed from the}} nickel in 1944 (to be replaced by steel, as noted during the Korean war) but the coins in <b>Tombac,</b> steel, or 99.9% nickel all remained twelve-sided until 1963.|$|E
