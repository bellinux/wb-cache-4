25|$|At Astoria a {{peaceful}} celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen {{were called in}} from {{the country to the}} city), police did little to defend the crush of radical anti-government protests that took place only 300–500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzsébet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the idea that this police behaviour was not by chance. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. <b>That</b> <b>crowd</b> could not be disbanded at all when police started a horse assault on Deák Square protesters.

25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat <b>that</b> <b>crowd</b> out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E

500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt <b>that</b> <b>crowd</b> noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick at times... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word you can think of was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical {{information}} about him relies on legends written centuries later, {{such as the}} 2nd-century CE Ashokavadana ("Narrative of Ashoka", {{a part of the}} Divyavadana), and in the Sri Lankan text Mahavamsa ("Great Chronicle").

2500|$|Johnson became {{president}} upon {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the goodwill generated by the incident gave him tremendous popularity. He enjoyed strong support against the bitterly divided Republicans; polls in January 1964 showed him leading Republican challengers Barry Goldwater 75% to 20% and Nelson Rockefeller 74% to 17%. However, Wallace had received over 100,000 letters and telegrams of support, nearly half from non-southerners, following his 1963 Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in defiance of {{a court order to}} integrate the University of Alabama, and he subsequently became [...] "Tennyson's Mordred, exposing the dark side of Camelot". He began a national speaking tour with a well-received lecture at Harvard on November 7, 1963, bringing him additional notoriety as he flirted {{with the idea of a}} national campaign. Wallace's charm and candor won over many of his critics; during a question and answer session at Harvard, a black man asserted his intention to run for president, to which Wallace smiled and responded, [...] "Between you and me both, we might get rid of <b>that</b> <b>crowd</b> in Washington. We might even run on the same ticket." [...] Meanwhile, Johnson forbade discussion of politics in the White House and refused to comment on whether he would run in the 1964 election, instead pursuing the late Kennedy's legislative agenda (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964), managing the Vietnam War, and declaring his own [...] "War on Poverty".|$|E

Norris Johnson, after investigating a panic at a 1979 The Who concert concluded <b>that</b> the <b>crowd</b> was composed of many small groups of people mostly trying to help each other. Additionally, Le Bon's theory ignores the socio-cultural context of the crowd, which some theorists argue can disempower social change. R.

2500|$|Mötley Crüe {{was formed}} on January 17, 1981 when bassist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked {{previously}} with Leon {{in a band}} called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Sixx and Lee then began a search for new members and soon met guitarist Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that Mars placed inside The Recycler that read: [...] "Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available". Mars auditioned for Sixx and Lee and was subsequently hired. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. Upon seeing Neil perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in West Hollywood, Mars suggested they have him join the band by stating, [...] "I don't care if he can sing. I don't care {{if he can do}} anything. The way he had <b>that</b> <b>crowd</b> going...THAT'S the guy we need." [...] At first Neil refused the offer, but as the other members of Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} the joint impact of target–flanker similarity and of spatial frequency content on the crowding effect in letter identification. We presented spatial frequency filtered letters to neurologically intact non-dyslexic readers while manipulating target–flanker distance, target eccentricity and target–flanker confusability (letter similarity metric based on published letter confusion matrices). The results show that high target–flanker confusability magnifies crowding. They also reveal an intricate pattern of interactions of the spatial frequency content of the stimuli with target eccentricity, flanker distance and similarity. The findings are congruent with the notion <b>that</b> <b>crowding</b> results from the inappropriate pooling of target and flanker features and that this integration {{is more likely to}} match a response template at a subsequent decision stage with similar than dissimilar flankers. In addition, the evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>crowding</b> from similar flankers is biased towards relatively high spatial frequencies and <b>that</b> <b>crowding</b> shifts towards lower spatial frequencies as target eccentricity is increased...|$|R
