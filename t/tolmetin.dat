40|$|Hepatic {{tryptophan}} 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) {{is one of}} the rate-limiting enzymes in tryptophan catabolism {{and plays}} an important role in regulating the physiological flux of tryptophan into relevant metabolic pathways. In this study, we determined the effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, <b>tolmetin</b> and sulindac, on rat liver TDO activity and the subsequent changes in the hippocampal and striatal neurotransmitter levels. The amount of melatonin produced by the pineal gland was also measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Treatment of rats with <b>tolmetin</b> or sulindac (5 mg/kg/bd for 5 days) significantly inhibited liver TDO activity. The results show that whilst <b>tolmetin</b> and sulindac increase serotonin levels in the hippocampus, these agents also significantly reduce dopamine levels in the striatum. <b>Tolmetin,</b> but not sulindac, increased the amount of melatonin produced by the pineal gland.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants have neuroprotective properties and may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, the possible neuroprotective properties of <b>tolmetin,</b> sulindac and turmeric were investigated. The antioxidant effects of <b>tolmetin</b> and sulindac were determined by inducing free radical generation with quinolinic acid (QA), cyanide or iron (II) in rat brain homogenates or primary hippocampal neurons. <b>Tolmetin</b> and sulindac significantly reduce lipid peroxidation and scavenge the superoxide anion. Metal binding studies were conducted to determine whether metal chelation is a possible mechanism through which these agents reduce QA and iron (II) -induced lipid peroxidation. UV/VIS, infrared spectroscopy as well as electrochemical studies show that both agents bind to iron (II) and/or iron (III). Histological examination of the hippocampus showed that pre-treatment of animals with <b>tolmetin</b> or sulindac offers protection against intrahippocampal injections of QA. These agents also attenuate QA-induced apoptosis and reduce the loss of neurons in the hippocampus. The co-incubation of primary hippocampal neurons with the NSAIDS also enhanced cell viability which is significantly reduced by QA. Behavioural studies using a water maze showed that the treatment of animals after QA-induced neurotoxicity reduces QA-induced spatial memory loss. <b>Tolmetin</b> and sulindac also reduced glutathione depletion and protein oxidation in rat hippocampus. Both NSAIDS inhibit liver tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity in vitro and in vivo and subsequently increased hippocampal serotonin levels. However, both NSAIDS also reduce dopamine levels in rat striatum. <b>Tolmetin</b> but not sulindac increased the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland. The active components of turmeric known as the curcuminoids were separated using preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC). The purity was confirmed by TLC, NMR and mass spectrometry. The environmental toxin lead, induces lipid peroxidation and reduces primary hippocampal neuronal viability. The co-incubation of the neurons with the curcuminoids significantly reduces lead-induced lipid peroxidation and enhances neuronal cell viability in the presence of lead. Lead-induced spatial memory deficit is also attenuated with curcumin, demethoxycurcumin but not bisdemethoxycurcumin. The curcuminoids also reduce lead-induced hippocampal glutathione depletion and protein oxidation. Metal binding studies show that the curcuminoids bind to lead and is another possible mechanism through which the curcuminoids reduce lead-induced neurotoxicity. The findings of this study indicate a possible role of <b>tolmetin,</b> sulindac and turmeric in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.

40|$|Acyl glucuronide {{metabolites}} of bilirubin {{and many}} drugs can react with serum albumin in vivo to form covalent adducts.

In this paper we describe the use of tandem mass spectrometry to locate binding sites and elucidate the binding mechanism involved in the formation of covalent adducts from <b>tolmetin</b> glucuronide and albumin in vitro. Human serum albumin and excess <b>tolmetin</b> glucuronide were coincubated in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to trap imine intermediates. The total protein product was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Six tolmetin-containing peptides (indicated by absorbance at 313 nm) were isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation, using a four-sector tandem mass spectrometer. All six peptides contained <b>tolmetin</b> linked covalently via a glucuronic acid to protein lysine groups. Major attachment sites on the protein were Lys- 195, - 199, and - 525; minor sites were identified as Lys- 137, - 351, and - 541.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} microencapsulated controlled release preparations of <b>tolmetin</b> sodium using ethylcellulose as a retardant material.

Span 80 was used as the droplet stabilizer and n -hexane was added to harden the microspheres. The prepared microspheres were characterized for their micromeritic properties, drug content, loading efficiency, production yield, and particle size. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize microparticles. The in vitro release studies were performed in pH 1. 2 and 7. 4. The prepared microspheres were spherical in shape. The drug-loaded microspheres showed near to the theoretical of entrapment and release was extended up to 24. The X-ray diffractogram and differential scanning thermographs showed amorphous state of the drug in the microspheres. It was shown that the drug: polymer ratio, stirring rate, volume of dispersing medium and surfactant influenced the drug loading, particle size and drug release behavior of the formed microparticles. The results showed that, generally, an increase in the ratio of drug: polymer (0. 5 : 1) resulted in a reduction in the release rate of the drug which may be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the polymer. The in vitro release profile could be modified by changing various processing and formulation parameters to give a controlled release of drug from the microparticules.
