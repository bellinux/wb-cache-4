5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. <b>These</b> <b>remarks</b> were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen, was later added to the tour. The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 presidential {{candidate}} Jesse Jackson and former United Nations ambassador Andrew Young made anti-Semitic comments, which were widely publicized. <b>These</b> <b>remarks</b> {{were thought to}} have extended the era of African-American and Jewish distrust into the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Together <b>these</b> <b>remarks</b> {{sanction}} {{the introduction}} of theories that are inconsistent with well-established facts. Furthermore, a pluralistic methodology that involves making comparisons between any theories at all forces defendants to improve the articulation of each theory. In this way, scientific pluralism improves the critical power of science. Pope Benedict XVI cited Feyerabend to this effect.|$|E

25|$|The 2004 presidential {{election}} debates included mentions of the same-sex marriage debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards mentioned and praised Cheney's openness {{with regard to}} her sexual orientation when questioned regarding gay issues. Some commentators viewed <b>these</b> <b>remarks</b> as a gratuitous, cynical appeal to residual homophobia among blue-collar voters in key swing states.|$|E
25|$|However, Mahathir's {{views were}} already firmly entrenched before this event. For example, before the ASEAN meeting in 1997, {{he made a}} speech condemning the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, calling it an oppressive {{instrument}} by which the United States and other countries try to impose their values on Asians. He added that Asians need stability and economic growth more than civil liberties. <b>These</b> <b>remarks</b> did not endear him to US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was a guest at the meeting.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, 15 lawmakers, all Republican, spoke. Many of them {{stressed}} the importance of backing and voting for only candidates whose platform supported antiabortion in the November elections. Among the lawmakers who spoke were Representatives Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. Tiahrt, who also spoke at the 30th annual march, urged marchers to “help pro-lifers in your state”; Toomey supported <b>these</b> <b>remarks,</b> saying to vote for pro-life candidates in order to reclaim the Senate and, in turn, the courts.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Morse opposed Eisenhower's {{appointment}} of Clare Boothe Luce as ambassador to Brazil. Morse, {{who had known}} Luce for many years, chastised Luce for her criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although the Senate confirmed Luce's appointment in a 79–11 vote, Luce retaliated against him. In her acceptance speech to the Senate, Luce commented that her troubles with Senator Morse were attributable to the injuries he sustained from being kicked by a horse in 1951. She also remarked that riots in Bolivia might {{be dealt with by}} dividing the country up among its neighbors. An immediate backlash against <b>these</b> <b>remarks</b> from Morse and other senators, and Luce's refusal to retract the remark about the horse, led to her resignation just three days after her appointment.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2017, it was {{reported}} in the media that the first secretary of the Iranian Embassy Hormoz Ghahremani, the visiting Iranian cleric Hojatoleslam Shafie, and community elder Sayed Taghi Derhami had made remarks denying the Holocaust and attacking Israel at the Shia Islamic Ahlulbayt Foundation in Pakuranga, Auckland during a meeting to commemorate Quds Day in June. A video of the speeches had been posted on the Foundation's YouTube channel. <b>These</b> <b>remarks</b> were criticized by the New Zealand Jewish Council and the pro-Israel think tank the Israel Institute of New Zealand, who advocated Ghahremani's expulsion. Ghahremani later clarified that his actions represented the Iranian government's official position on Israel. Race Relations Commissioner Devoy also condemned the trio's anti-Semitic statements. The opposition New Zealand National Party's foreign affairs spokesperson Gerry Brownlee also urged the incumbent Labour-New Zealand First-Green coalition government to expel Ghahremani. In response, Foreign Minister Winston Peters countered that the incident had occurred under the previous National government's watch. Peters indicated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade had summoned Ghahremani to express its disapproval.|$|E

500|$|Noether's {{suggestion}} that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others, {{and it became}} a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen. Noether observed that her idea of a Betti group makes the Euler–Poincaré formula simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject [...] "bears the imprint of <b>these</b> <b>remarks</b> of Emmy Noether". Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication, where she cites it as an application of group theory.|$|E

500|$|The next week, Barr {{appeared}} on Fox News, where he criticized the United States Treasury Department's {{plan to help}} Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
