Custine's lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the {{courthouse}} to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict {{so that they could}} continue <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> at her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by guillotine on the following day, 28 August 1793.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E

5|$|Two years {{pass and}} couple have their first child. Their family {{physician}} offers {{to perform an}} operation to restore May's sight. Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E
5|$|When Love Was Blind is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on young blind woman, May Read, who is saved from her burning home by Frank Larson. In the act of saving her, Frank is disfigured, but the two fall and love, marry and have a child. Two years later, the family physician offers to restore May's sight through a surgery. Frank consents despite his fears that May will not love him if she gazes upon his disfigured face. The surgery is a success and the doctor tells May not to remove the bandages. May ignores this warning and is permanently blinded after attempting <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> at her husband, but she is content knowing her baby is beautiful. Directed by Lucius J. Henderson and starred Lucille Younge, the film was a critical success. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Jason promised Sam that he would bring her back to Italy to spend time together. The star gazing later inspired Jason to buy Sam a star shaped necklace, which became a tangible item of the theme of stars in their relationship. Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E

30|$|The {{experiment}} utilized a 2 (teacher {{gesture to}} graphs: yes or no)[*]×[*] 2 (teacher gesture to equations: yes or no) design which yielded four lesson conditions: no gesture, gesture to equations only, gesture to graphs only, or gesture to both equations and graphs. In {{all of the}} conditions, the teacher <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of the visual representations when she mentioned them; her gaze was scripted and did not vary across conditions. In the no-gesture condition, the teacher did not produce any hand gestures to the visual representations; however, she did <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> elements of the graphs and equations when she spoke about them. In the gesture-to-graphs-only condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> <b>to</b> elements of the graphs when she mentioned them during the lesson, {{but she did not}} point to the equations. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of the graphs, but only <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of the equations. In the gesture-to-equations-only condition, the teacher gestured to elements of the equations when she mentioned them during the lesson, but did not point to the graphs. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of the equations, but only <b>gazed</b> <b>to</b> elements of the graphs. In the gesture-to-both-graphs-and-equations condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> <b>to</b> elements of both the graphs and the equations during the lesson when she mentioned them.|$|R

40|$|In {{search of}} key-performance {{predictors}} in sailing, we examined {{to what degree}} visual search, movement behaviour and boat control contribute to skilled performance while rounding the windward mark. To this end, we analysed 62 windward mark roundings sailed without opponents and 40 windward mark roundings sailed with opponents while competing in small regattas. Across conditions, results revealed that better performances were related <b>to</b> <b>gazing</b> more <b>to</b> the tangent point during the actual rounding. More specifically, in the condition without opponents, skilled performance was associated with gazing more outside the dinghy during the actual rounding, while in the condition with opponents, superior performance was related <b>to</b> <b>gazing</b> less outside the dinghy. With respect to movement behaviour, superior performance {{was associated with the}} release of the trimming lines close to rounding the mark. In addition, better performances were related to approaching the mark with little heel, yet heeling the boat more to the windward side when being close to the mark. Potential implications for practice are suggested for each phase of the windward mark rounding...|$|R

25|$|Rusk {{was born}} on November 20, 1871 in Knox County, Illinois to James A. and Josie A. Rusk. His family emigrated from Illinois to Washington Territory {{in the fall of}} 1874. They settled in eastern Klickitat County in an area known as Wood Gulch. In 1878, Rusk’s only sibling, Leah, was born. Several years later, in 1879, they moved {{to the foot of the}} Columbia Hills in the lower Klickitat Valley near Warwick. Over the next year, Rusk’s father built the Happy Home stage station. Rusk often went to the top of the Columbia Hills <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> at the various peaks of the Cascade Range. They lived in this place until Rusk was 15. They then moved to a {{homestead}} on the banks of the Klickitat River near Soda Springs in January 1887.|$|E
25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or an experience of the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest. At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
25|$|Omitted from {{mainstream}} histories of American painting, Anderson’s work {{has not received}} sufficient critical attention, perhaps because he chose {{to live in a}} small Southern town, patiently acquiring what he called “definite knowledge” of local forms. Fiercely independent in spirit, indifferent to his own “career,” Anderson did nothing to cultivate fame or critical attention and sometimes seemed to flee them. When the Brooklyn Museum invited him to an exhibition of his linoleum block prints in 1948, he chose instead to travel to China, where he hoped <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> upon unknown landscapes and examine Tibetan murals (the China trip ended, deep inland, when his passport and other belongings were stolen and Anderson returned, partly on foot, to his point of departure in Hong Kong.) Anderson’s painting– a search for the spiritual and transcendent in the forms of the natural world – thrived on his love of limits, and the overwhelming majority of his best watercolors, undated and unsigned, were done on 8.5 x 11 typing paper with little thought for posterity. Rarely did he sign and date them. For him, painting was simply a way of turning art and nature into “a single thing,” helping the natural world “realize” itself through the artist’s intervention “Order is here,” he wrote of Horn Island, “but it needs realizing,” and to him “realization”—a term which he seems to have borrowed from Cézanne, one of his favorite painters, and adapted to his own use—meant discovering and giving memorable form to unities missed by the casual observer.|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, we used an ISCAN {{infrared}} {{video system}} {{to examine the}} influence of a pitched visual array on gaze elevation and on judgments of visually perceived eye level. In Experiment 1, subjects attempted <b>to</b> direct their <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> a relaxed or to a horizontal orientation while they were seated in a room whose walls were pitched at various angles with respect <b>to</b> gravity. <b>Gaze</b> elevation was biased in the direction in which the room was pitched. In Experiment 2, subjects looked into a small box that was pitched at various angles while they attempted simply <b>to</b> direct their <b>gaze</b> alone, or <b>to</b> direct their <b>gaze</b> and place a visual target at their apparent horizon. Both gaze elevation and target settings varied systematically with the pitch orientation of the box. Our results suggest that under these conditions, an optostatic response, of which the subject is unaware, is responsible for the changes in both gaze elevation and judgments of target elevation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} another person’s gaze on {{physiological}} arousal were investigated by measuring skin conductance responses (SCR). Twelve able {{children with autism}} and 12 control children were shown face stimuli with straight gaze (eye contact) or averted gaze on a computer monitor. In children with autism, the responses <b>to</b> straight <b>gaze</b> were stronger than responses <b>to</b> averted <b>gaze,</b> whereas {{there was no difference}} in the responses <b>to</b> these <b>gaze</b> conditions in normally developing children. Thus, these results showed that eye gaze elicited differential pattern of SCR in normally developing children and in children with autism. It is possible that the enhanced arousal to eye contact may contribute <b>to</b> the abnormal <b>gaze</b> behaviour frequently reported in the context of autism. KEY WORDS: High functioning autism; skin conductance responses; electrodermal activity; eye contact; gaze direction. Eye contact is a powerful stimulus in social interaction. People are very accurate at discriminating whether another person is looking straight at them or whether the gaze is averted, especially when the other person’s face is seen from straight ahead (Anstis...|$|R
