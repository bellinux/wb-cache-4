[...] Most of this conflict occurred in Bohemia (part of the modern Czech Republic) from 1778 to 1779, between the Habsburg Monarchy, Saxony, Bavaria and Prussia. The war had no battles, but was instead a series of skirmishes and raids, making it <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>situation</b> for a captain of light cavalry.

[...] Modular design, where a failure might be corrected by changing out a module, was not yet in use; thus, maintenance required detailed circuit tracing and knowledge of the circuit theory. It was agreed that <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>situation</b> would be to recruit persons with an electrical engineering (EE) or similar education and put them through the existing five-month advanced segment of the RMS to learn Navy hardware.

2500|$|Justices Marie Deschamps and Rosalie Abella wrote a concurring opinion. [...] While {{they agreed}} with Charron's {{decision}} {{to overturn the}} ban on the kirpan, {{they found that the}} proper way to do this was through the rules of administrative law. [...] Constitutional law should be used primarily for statutes and regulations, and the tests used in constitutional law, such as the Oakes test, work best on these laws. [...] Section 1 of the Charter indicates the Oakes test best applies to decisions [...] "prescribed by law." [...] Meanwhile, administrative law would work when dealing with what in this case was an administrative body. [...] Following the Trinity Western University case and Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, Charron and Abella also felt a measure of deference was appropriate. [...] There was also indication that the law meant for local authorities rather than courts to have a greater say in such matters. [...] At any rate, Descamps and Abella found that [...] "it is difficult to imagine a decision that would be considered reasonable or correct even though it conflicted with constitutional values."

40|$|Objective. Female unpromoted general {{practice}} dentists (GPDs) constitute {{about one-quarter of}} all dentists in Sweden. These female dentists suffer from many problems relating to their psychosocial working conditions. There are wide discrepancies between their perception of <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> job <b>situation</b> and reality. Previously, three factors were found to constitute <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> job <b>situation.</b> <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} was to analyze patterns in two of these factors, i. e. the moral and the career factors, for understanding how ideal circumstances are conceived, i. e. how ‘‘good work’’ for the dentists could be obtained. Material and Methods. In the year 2000, all female unpromoted GPDs (183 persons) within the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS) in a region in Sweden received a questionnaire; response rate 94 %. Four multiple regression models were constructed for two factors of good work and for the differences between <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> job <b>situation</b> and reality concerning these factors. Results. In all models, the explained variance was high. Those dentists who were committed to moral issues perceived large differences between <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> and reality concerning moral values. Dentists committed to career issues experienced large differences between <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> and reality concerning career development. Those dentists - about 60 % - who would not want to be a dentist if they were to choose today, perceived large discrepancies concerning moral and career issues. Conclusions. The PDHS organization has failed to convince or engage those whom it ought to engage, that is those with the highest level of commitment.

Our model consists of linearly coupled boson modes which can be realized by quantum optical fields in the rotating wave approximation.

The initial states of the probe modes and the coupling are utilized to optimize the operation in the various regimes. In contrast to the Arthurs and Kelly ideal scheme [Bell. Syst. Tech.
