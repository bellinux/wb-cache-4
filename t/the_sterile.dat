5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow <b>the</b> <b>Sterile</b> Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to <b>the</b> <b>sterile</b> conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to <b>the</b> <b>sterile</b> conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E

40|$|A natural {{male sterile}} mutant of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Labiatae, Sh-B) was found during field survey in 2002. Our {{objective}} was to analyze its genetic mechanism for producing F 1 hybrid seeds {{and to develop a}} molecular marker linked to male sterile gene for selection of a hybrid parent line. The segregation ratios of male sterile plants to fertile plants in the progenies of both testcross and backcross were 1 : 1 in continuous experiments conducted in 2006 – 2009. <b>The</b> male <b>sterile</b> Sh-B was heterozygous (Msms). <b>The</b> male <b>sterile</b> plants could capture most pollen (2 granule/cm 2 ? 24 h) with row ratio (female: male 2 : 1) within 45 -cm distance and harvest the largest amount of 6495 g hybrid seeds per hectare.
