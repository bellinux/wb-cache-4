40|$|The {{blanching}} {{activities of}} Betnovate© cream, lotion, ointment and scalp application (each containing 0. 1 % betamethasone (as the 17 -valerate)) were determined using healthy human subjects over a 32 h period {{in both the}} occludedand unoccluded modes. Considering that allfour formulation types contained the same label concentration of corticosteroid,it may bepresumed that theformulations would show similar topical drug availability: this was, however, {{not found to be}} the case. The scalp application demonstrated the highest <b>topical</b> <b>availability</b> in both the occluded and unoccluded modes. The lotion formulation showed the greatest increase in <b>topical</b> <b>availability</b> on occlusion and the ointment formulation was the least sensitive to the effects of occlusion. These differences, due solely to the effects of the vehicle, may have important clinical implications...|$|E
40|$|Release of {{betamethasone}} valerate (betamethasone 17 -valerate) from 3 extemporaneous cream formulations (1 control, 1 containing propylene glycol, and 1 containing /̱-cyclodextrin) and a commercial cream formulation (Betnovate) was compared using the human skin blanching assay in 12 healthy male volunteers. All 3 extemporaneous formulations showed similar drug release rates, equivalent to {{or better than}} the commercial preparation containing betamethasone in a 10 fold higher concentration. Electron microscopic examination showed considerably finer dispersion of the oil phase in the extemporaneous formulations. It was concluded that the increased surface area available for partitioning of betamethasone between the cream and the skin {{is responsible for the}} improved <b>topical</b> <b>availability</b> of the drug from the extemporaneous formulations...|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldDue to limited aqueous solubility of dorzolamide at physiologic pH, the pH of Trusopt eye drops (cont. 2 % dorzolamide) {{has to be kept}} at about 5. 65, and to increase the topical bioavailability of the drug from Trusopt the contact time of the drug with the eye surface is increased by increasing the viscosity of the eye drops to 100 cps. This low pH and high viscosity can lead to local irritation. In this study, dorzolamide hydrochloride was formulated as 2 % and 4 % low viscosity solutions (viscosity 3 to 5 cps) containing randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin at pH 7. 45. These formulations were evaluated in rabbits. The animals were sacrificed at various time points after topical administration of the drug and the dorzolamide concentration determined in the different parts of the eye. Trusopt was used as a reference standard. The <b>topical</b> <b>availability</b> of dorzolamide from the cyclodextrin-containing eye drops appeared to be comparable to that from Trusopt and the drug reached retina and optic nerve to give measurable concentrations for at least 8 h after administration of the eye drops...|$|E
40|$|The {{human skin}} {{blanching}} assay remains in widespread {{use as a}} reliable, qualitative, comparative indicator of <b>topical</b> corticosteroid <b>availability</b> and potency. The experimental refinements promulgated by certain researchers in this field have yielded a versatile bioassay for the accurate assessment of new drugs or delivery vehicles. With the increasing appearance of generic topical corticosteroid formulations which compete with trade-name equivalents, the vital importance of this assay in regulatory affairs and assessing bioequivalence has been re-emphasized. It is stressed that if the blanching assay {{is to be used}} in this sphere, then multiple-reading trials must be conducted; important registration or clinical decisions cannot be made with any validity from short-term assessments...|$|R
40|$|Microemulsions (MEs) are clear, {{thermodynamically}} stable systems. They {{were used}} to solubilize drugs and to improve <b>topical</b> drug <b>availability.</b> Salicylic acid (SA) is a keratolytic agent used in topical products with antimicrobial actions. The objective of this work was to prepare and evaluate SA ME systems. Different concentrations of SA were incorporated in an ME base composed of isopropyl myristate, water, and Tween 80 : propylene glycol in the ratio of 15 : 1. Three ME systems were prepared: S 2 %, S 5 %, and S 10 % which contain 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % of SA, respectively. Evaluation by examination under cross-polarizing microscope, measuring of percent transmittance, pH measurement, determination of the specific gravity, assessment of rheological properties, and accelerated stability study were carried out. The data showed that the addition of SA markedly affected the physical properties of the base. All systems were not affected by accelerated stability tests. Stability study for 6  months under ambient conditions was carried out for S 10 %. No remarkable changes were recorded except {{a decrease in the}} viscosity value after 1  month. The results suggested that ME could be a suitable vehicle for topical application of different concentrations of SA...|$|R
40|$|Community Question Answering (CQA) service enables {{its users}} to {{exchange}} {{knowledge in the}} form of questions and answers. By allowing the users to contribute knowledge, CQA not only satisfies the question askers but also provides valuable references to other users with similar queries. Due to a large volume of questions, not all questions get fully answered. As a result, it can be useful to route a question to a potential answerer. In this paper, we present a question routing scheme which takes into account the answering, commenting and voting propensities of the users. Unlike prior work which focuses on routing a question to the most desirable expert, we focus on routing it to a group of users- who would be willing to collaborate and provide useful answers to that question. Through empirical evidence, we show that more answers and comments are desirable for improving the lasting value of a question-answer thread. As a result, our focus is on routing a question to a team of compatible users. We propose a recommendation model that takes into account the compatibility, <b>topical</b> expertise and <b>availability</b> of the users. Our experiments over a large real-world dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach over several baseline models...|$|R
40|$|In a Guidance document, the American FDA {{recommends}} {{the use of}} a Minolta chromameter rather than the human eye for the quantitative assessment of the pharmacodynamic blanching response produced by topical application of corticosteroids. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the appropriateness of the human eye and two models of chromameter for the estimation of skin blanching, in terms of the quality of the data generated by each method. The corticosteroid-induced skin blanching from four different betamethasone 17 -valerate cream formulations was compared in a typical human skin blanching trial. The optimized assay methodology routinely practised in our laboratories was utilized. The blanching responses were assessed visually by three trained, independent observers and recorded by two chromameters (Minolta model CR- 200 and model CR- 300). The <b>topical</b> <b>availability</b> of the four creams was determined using visual scoring and chromameter measurements. All data were manipulated in such a manner as to produce a blanching response versus time profile from which AUBC analysis could be performed. Good correlation was observed between the visual assessments made by three independent observers. In contrast, moderate correlation was determined between visual, CR- 200 and CR- 300 measurements. Surprisingly, no direct linear relationship between the AUBCs produced by the two chromameters was observed indicating that the quality of the data obtained from the two instruments may not be equal. This investigation also indicated that the use of the chromameter is not completely objective. Visual scoring and chromameter measurement produce data sets that differ in quality. Each procedure needs to be validated and investigators have to be trained for both visual assessment and the operation of the chromameter, particularly with regard to the manipulation of the measuring head of the instrument...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To examine {{adoption}} of telehealth {{in a rural}} public health district and {{to explain how the}} innovation became sustainable. Study Setting. Longitudinal, qualitative study (1988 – 2008) of the largest public health district in Georgia. Study Design. Case study design provided deep insights into the innovation’s social dynamics. Punctuated equilibrium theory helped present and make sense of the process. We identified antecedent conditions and outcomes, and we distinguished between ep-isodes and encounters based on the disruptive effects of events. Data Collection. Twenty-five semistructured interviews with 19 decision makers and professionals, direct observations, published papers, grant proposals, technical speci-fications, and other written materials. Principal Findings. Strong collaboration within the district, with local community, and with external partners energized the process. Well-functioning outreach clinics made telehealth desirable. Local champions cultivated participation and generative capability, and overcame barriers through opportunistic exploitation of technological and financial options. Telehealth usage fluctuated between medical and administrative operations in response to internal needs and contextual dynamics. External agencies provided initial funding and supported later expansion. Conclusions. Extensive internal and external collaboration, and a combination of technology push and opportunistic exploitation, can enable sustainable rural telehealth innovation. Key Words. Telehealth innovation, rural health, process model, punctuated equilibrium theory, case study, qualitative research Two decades after Health Services Research published a special issue on the subject (Hersh and Van Hook 1989), rural health care delivery remains a <b>topical</b> research area. <b>Availability</b> and accessibility of rural health care services are still major concerns, and rural health care institutions remain vulnerabl...|$|R
