40|$|The life {{histories}} of many animals {{are characterized by}} niche shifts, the timing of which can strongly affect fitness. In the <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> <b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas, which has arboreal eggs, there is a trade-off between predation risks before and after hatching. When eggs are attacked by snakes, tadpoles escape by hatching rapidly and falling into the water below. Eggs not attacked by snakes hatch later, when newly emerged tadpoles are less vulnerable to aquatic predators. Plasticity in hatching allows embryos to use immediate, local information on risk of mortality to make instantaneous behavioral decisions about hatching and the accompanying shift from arboreal to aquatic habitats...|$|R
50|$|The pink-sided <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> litodryas) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Hylidae.It is found in Ecuador, Panama, and {{possibly}} Colombia.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and rivers.It is threatened by habitat loss. The frogs are an arboreal species of humid lowland forest. The single specimen in Panama was collected on a bush in a swamp. The holotype was found at night perched about {{one and a half}} meters above the ground in a bush {{at the edge of a}} swamp (Duellman and Trueb 1967). A gliding species, the Ecuadorian specimens have been heard calling from bushes overhanging a shallow pond in a banana grove at night (Duellman 2001). It deposits its eggs on the leaves floating on ponds, and larvae jump into the pond and develop in the water. Since it depends on the forest canopy, it is not very adaptable to disturbances.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of ex situ conservation programmes as highlighted in the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan, there are few empirical studies that examine the influence of captive conditions on the fitness of amphibians, even for basic components of enclosure design such as cover provision. Maintaining the fitness of captive amphibian populations {{is essential to the}} success of ex situ conservation projects. Here we examined the impact of plant cover on measures of fitness and behaviour in captive red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas). We found significant effects of plant provision on body size, growth rates and cutaneous bacterial communities that together demonstrate a compelling fitness benefit from cover provision. We also demonstrate a strong behavioural preference for planted rather than non-planted areas. We also assessed the impact of plant provision on the abiotic environment in the enclosure as a potential driver of these behavioural and fitness effects. Together this data provides valuable information regarding enclosure design for a non-model amphibian species and has implications for amphibian populations maintained in captivity for conservation breeding programmes and research...|$|R
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above.

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of heritable phenotypic diversity reflect the relative roles of gene flow and selection in determining geographic variation within a species. We quantified color differentiation and genetic divergence among 20 {{populations of the}} red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas) in lower Central America. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 5 well-supported mitochondrial DNA clades, and we infer from our phylogeny that geographic barriers have played {{a large role in}} structuring populations. Two phenotypic characters varied independently among isolated population groups: Flank coloration distinguished Caribbean from Pacific individuals, whereas leg coloration exhibited a more complex geographic pattern. We detected 3 generalized spatial {{patterns of}} genetic and phenotypic diversity: 1) phenotypic differentiation in the presence of historical connectivity, 2) phenotypic uniformity across genetically differentiated regions, and 3) codistribution of genetic and phenotypic characters. These patterns indicate that phenotypic diversification is highly regionalized and can result from spatial variation in localized adaptations, geographic isolation, genetic drift, and/or evolutionary stasis. Although the mode of selection underlying color variation was not the focal objective of this study, we discuss the possible roles of natural and sexual selection in mediating population differentiation.

50|$|ReproductionThe red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> <b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas, is an {{arboreal}} frog (hylid) that {{resides in}} the tropics of Central America.  Unlike many <b>frogs,</b> the red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> has arboreal eggs which are laid on leaves hanging over ponds or large puddles and, upon hatching, the tadpoles fall into the water below. One {{of the most common}} predators encountered by these arboreal eggs is the cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira septentrionalis.  In order to escape predation, the red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> have developed a form of adaptive plasticity, which can also be considered phenotypic plasticity, when it comes to hatching age; the clutch is able to hatch prematurely and survive outside of the egg five days after oviposition when faced with an immediate threat of predation.  The egg clutches take in important information from the vibrations felt around them and use it {{to determine whether or not}} they are at risk of predation. In the event of a snake attack, the clutch identifies the threat by the vibrations given off which, in turn, stimulates hatching almost instantaneously.  In a controlled experiment conducted by Karen Warkentin, hatching rate and ages of red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> were observed in clutches that were and were not attacked by the cat-eyed snake.  When a clutch was attacked at six days of age, the entire clutch hatched at the same time, almost instantaneously. However, when a clutch is not presented with the threat of predation, the eggs hatch gradually over time with the first few hatching around seven days after oviposition, and the last of the clutch hatching around day ten. Karen Warkentin's study further explores the benefits and trade-offs of hatching plasticity in the red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|R
40|$|Amphibians possess innate immune defences, {{including}} antimicrobial peptides and symbiotic bacterial communities, {{that can}} {{protect them from}} infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis. On-going research is attempting to use amphibian symbiotic bacteria to develop probiotic treatments that can protect hosts from the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Events that cause disruption of symbiotic bacterial communities or deplete peptide stores could increase the susceptibility of individuals to disease and may have implications for amphibians involved in probiotic trials or time course studies that investigate symbiotic bacterial communities. It has previously been shown that passive integrated transponder tagging of frogs causes a rapid (within 24  h) and major proliferation of micro-organisms on the skin. Here, we show that marking of red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas) with visible elastomer {{has no effect on}} adrenal response (represented by faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations) or peptide production, although there was evidence of a slightly greater microbial abundance associated with the skin of marked frogs 2  weeks after tagging. The results indicate that visible elastomer may be a preferable marking technique to passive integrated transponder tagging, particularly in the context of probiotic trials or time course studies that investigate symbiotic bacterial communities. More work is required {{to determine the effects of}} different marking techniques on physiological responses of amphibians, whether these physiological responses are consistent across host species and whether such ‘non-invasive’ marking methods affect the susceptibility of amphibians to infectious pathogens, such as B.  dendrobatidis...|$|R
40|$|Amphibians support {{symbiotic}} bacterial {{communities on}} their skin that protect against {{a range of}} infectious pathogens, including the amphibian chytrid fungus. The conditions under which amphibians are maintained in captivity (e. g. diet, substrate, enrichment) in ex situ conservation programmes may affect {{the composition of the}} bacterial community. In addition, ex situ amphibian populations may support different bacterial communities in comparison to in situ populations of the same species. This could have implications for the suitability of populations intended for reintroduction, as well as the success of probiotic bacterial inoculations intended to provide amphibians with a bacterial community that resists invasion by the chytrid fungus. We aimed to investigate the effect of a carotenoid-enriched diet on the culturable bacterial community associated with captive red-eyed <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas) and make comparisons to bacteria isolated from a wild population from the Chiquibul Rainforest in Belize. We successfully showed carotenoid availability influences the overall community composition, species richness and abundance of the bacterial community associated with the skin of captive frogs, with A. callidryas fed a carotenoid-enriched diet supporting a greater species richness and abundance of bacteria than those fed a carotenoid-free diet. Our results suggest that availability of carotenoids in the diet of captive frogs is likely to be beneficial for the bacterial community associated with the skin. We also found wild A. callidryas hosted more than double the number of different bacterial species than captive frogs with very little commonality between species. Thi...|$|R
40|$|Body size is {{important}} in determining the outcome of competition and predator-prey interactions. Size structure of a population (i. e. relative proportion of large and small conspecifics) may be particularly important in organisms with prolonged breeding periods and rapid growth where populations may have multiple cohorts {{at different stages of}} development competing for one resource. Both the consumptive and nonconsumptive effects of predators can also be size-dependent and can alter competitive interactions. Here we study the importance of size structure in the Neotropical leaf-breeding <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> <b>Agalychnis</b> callidryas. This species is a prolonged breeder such that multiple overlapping cohorts of differing sizes are common. Specifically, we examine size-specific intraspecific competition between A. callidryas tadpoles and then explore how predation affects these interactions. To determine the strength of inter-cohort competition, we manipulated the density and relative proportion of large and hatchling tadpoles in a response surface design and quantified growth. We then observed the effect of a dragonfly larvae predator (Anax amazili) on tadpole growth and survival at different size-structured treatments. Large tadpoles were greater per individual competitors while hatchlings were greater per gram competitors. When predators were added, dragonflies reduced survival and growth of hatchlings substantially, but had no effect on large tadpoles. Further, dragonflies reduced hatchling growth more when other hatchlings were present. The predator effect on hatchling growth was 23 % larger than the effect of competition with large tadpoles, such that the importance of size structure for A. callidryas may be mediated more through predation than intercohort competition...|$|R
40|$|Symbiotic {{bacterial}} communities play a {{key role}} in protecting amphibians from infectious diseases including chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Events that lead to the disruption of the bacterial community may have implications for the susceptibility of amphibians to such diseases. Amphibians are often marked both in the wild and in captivity for a variety of reasons, and although existing literature indicates that marking techniques have few negative effects, the response of cutaneous microbial communities has not yet been investigated. Here we determine the effects of passive inte-grated transponder (PIT) tagging on culturable cutaneous microbial communities of captive Morelet’s <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> (<b>Agalychnis</b> moreletii) and assess the isolated bacterial strains for anti-B. dendrobatidis activity in vitro. We find that PIT tagging causes a major disruption to the bacterial community associated with the skin of frogs (12 -fold increase in abundance), as well as a con-current proliferation in resident fungi (up to 200 -fold increase). Handling also caused a disruption the bacterial community, although to a lesser extent than PIT tagging. However, the effects of both tagging and handling were temporary, and after 2 weeks, the bacterial communities were similar to their original compositions. We also identify two bacterial strains that inhibit B. dendrobatidis, one of which increased in abundance on PIT-tagged frogs at 1 day postmarking, while the other was unaf-fected. These results show that PIT tagging has previously unobserved consequences for cutaneous microbial communities of frogs and may be particularly relevant for studies that intend to use PIT tagging to identify individuals involved in trials to de-velop probiotic treatments...|$|R
40|$|Samual Williams MRes thesis ABSTRACT The {{ecology of}} the Buton macaque (Macaca ochreata brunnescens) is poorly understood, and its status and habitat {{preferences}} have not been previously investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the population density and population size of the Buton macaque in the forests of central Buton. The habitat requirements of the species were also investigated. Data collected indicate a population density of 14. 9 Buton macaques/km 2, and a current population size of 3, 752 within the protected forests of central Buton. This is likely to be viable in the long- term. No habitat preferences could be identified, although the current habitat appears adequate. Howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.) were studied in Honduras with the aim of identifying the species present and characterising its activity patterns. There is dispute over the identity of the howler monkey species occurring in Honduras, but morphological and behavioural data presented here indicate that the species present in the Cusuco National Park, Honduras, is A. palliata. A new, molecular, species identification technique using non-invasively collected DNA samples extracted from faeces was also employed, although this was unsuccessful. Differences were observed between the activity budgets of male and female howler monkeys, which could be explained by their different social roles. However, the sample size of the study was relatively small. The eye morphology of the <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> <b>Agalychnis</b> calcarifer and A. craspedopus, is unusual within the genus Agalychnis.
