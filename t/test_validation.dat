The focus is on the interpretation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines (EEOC, 1978) as they relate to <b>test</b> <b>validation.</b> The sanctioned validation methods are content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. The measurement theory used to evaluate the quality of employment tests is based on the American Psychological Association standards for validating educational and psychological tests (A. P. A, 1985; A. YA., 1987). A major difference in physical <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> is the use of physiological rather then psycho-logical tests.

40|$|The {{application}} of interval partial least squares (IPLS) and moving window partial least squares (MWPLS) to the enantiomeric analysis of tryptophan (Trp) was investigated. A UV-Vis spectroscopy method {{for determining the}} enantiomeric composition of Trp was developed. The calibration model was built by using partial least squares (PLS), IPLS and MWPLS respectively. Leave-one-out cross validation and external <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> {{were used to assess}} the prediction performance of the established models. The validation result demonstrates the established full-spectrum PLS model is impractical for quantifying the relationship between the spectral data and enantiomeric composition of L-Trp. On the contrary, the developed IPLS and MWPLS model are both practicable for modeling this relationship. For the IPLS model, the root mean square relative error (RMSRE) of external <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> and leave-one-out cross validation is 4. 03 and 6. 50 respectively. For the MWPLS model, the RMSRE of external <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> and leave-one-out cross validation is 2. 93 and 4. 73 respectively. Obviously, the prediction accuracy of the MWPLS model is higher than that of the IPLS model. It is demonstrated UV-Vis spectroscopy combined with MWPLS is a commendable method for determining the enantiomeric composition of Trp. MWPLS is superior to IPLS for selecting spectral region in UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis...|$|E
40|$|More {{than any}} other area, {{validation}} research is where the 2 ̆ 2 rubber meets the road 2 ̆ 2 in test construction and test usage. The very term validation implies the assessment or measurement of individuals {{and the relationship of}} this assessment to some criterion of performance. The success of a <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> effort, or the lack thereof, has implications for the value of the assessment and for the utility of the procedures. In today 2 ̆ 7 s environment, whether the validation is intended for employee selection, educational decisions, or personal counseling, there is an increasing probability that the outcomes of research will have legal implications. In the past, a testing program could be set up in terms of professional judgment without including the experimental validation of the procedures. If the individuals involved in establishing the test program were knowledgeable, it was quite possible the tests, although unvalidated, would make a practical contribution in terms of the goals intended. In the absence of a formal validation, however, one would never know {{the extent to which the}} testing program was successful or superior to another assessment procedure. A testing program that does not involve validation research is at best an unknown and at worst may be an outright fraud. In either case, the likelihood that testing procedures will have to be defended, including the possibility of legal action, has increased dramatically. The purpose of the present review is to look carefully at the current status and future directions of <b>test</b> <b>validation</b> research.

The modeling methods and dynamic stress analysis approaches are highlighted {{in order to}} achieve a compromise of the technical accuracy, computational cost and effectiveness requirements. The antenna launch-lock mechanisms with small clearance are modeled as equivalent linear springs (CELAS 2 's) by using the iteration technique. A linearized and locally remeshed assembly model is then effectively used to perform dynamic and stress analyses, by employing the MSC/NASTRAN programs. It is shown that the analysis results of the nonlinear gimbaled antennas, in terms of major modal frequencies, sine and random acceleration response, correlate the measured qualification test data very well.
