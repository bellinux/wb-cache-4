The 1961 team, attempting LSU coach Paul Dietzel's three-platoon system, finished with a 4–5–1 record. The Gators won the Gator Bowl again in 1962, upsetting ninth-ranked Penn State. They wore the Confederate Battle Flag {{on the side of}} their helmets <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> the southern team facing a favored northern school. Florida began its 1963 season with a 1–1–1 record. The season highlight followed: a 10–6 upset of the Joe Namath-quarterbacked, third-ranked Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa, one of only two home losses in Denny Stadium during Bear Bryant's twenty-five years at Alabama. Before the game, Florida's defensive coordinator Gene Ellenson challenged his shaky team's manhood and they rose to the occasion. The Gators won their last three games—against Georgia (21–14), Miami (27–21) and FSU (7–0)—to finish with a 6–3–1 record.|$|E

An hour before starting the final leg of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga sent four tracks to Rolling Stone, including [...] "Scheiße", [...] "You and I", and [...] "The Edge of Glory", for a preview. Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of [...] "Hair", describing it as another inspirational {{song in the}} mold of [...] "Born This Way", but {{felt that it was}} a bit weirder. Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, she seems to be the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of the wind blowing through a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> your follicles with pride." [...] She added that the overall feel of the song was that of retro dance music.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the live}} tapings, and {{prior to the}} show, there was an {{audience}} warm-up, during which the audience watched a montage of highlights from the show, and staff writer Brian McCann greeted the audience (this task was formerly undertaken by head writer Mike Sweeney). McCann delivered a few jokes, told the audience what to expect, and finally introduced the band and then O'Brien. O'Brien then thanked the audience for coming, meeting as many audience members as he could. He would often then do a musical number with the band <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> the audience (Burning Love was one standard). [...] After the show was finished taping, O'Brien sang the [...] "End of the Show Song", which never aired on Late Night, although in February 2009, a short video of it was posted on Late Night Underground.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{returned}} to Chicago in 1925 due {{mostly to the}} urging of his wife, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> Armstrong's career and income. He was content in New York but later would concede that she was right and that the Henderson Orchestra was limiting his artistic growth. In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed him as [...] "the World's Greatest Trumpet Player". At first, he was actually {{a member of the}} Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife. He began recording under his own name for Okeh with his famous Hot Five and Hot Seven groups, producing hits such as [...] "Potato Head Blues", [...] "Muggles" [...] (a slang term for marijuana cigarettes: Armstrong used marijuana daily for much of his life), and [...] "West End Blues", the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come.|$|E

2500|$|A second key musical {{element in}} hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken {{delivery}} of rhymes and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat. This spoken style {{was influenced by}} the African American style of [...] "capping", a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners. The basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps, rival [...] "posses" [...] (groups), uptown [...] "throw-downs", and political and social commentary—were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of [...] "toasting'" [...] songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a Master of Ceremonies for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> the audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.|$|E

There were great {{floating}} {{houses in the}} water, for the baths, with wheels turning in the current <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> water, and little flower gardens along the brink of the stream. At least, in some places there were flower gardens; and in others there was a wall along the water, with boys {{sitting on the edge}} of it, fishing. Presently we came to a place where there was an opening in the parapet and stairs to go down to the water. You go down two or three steps first, and then the stairs turn each way. At the turning there was a man who had fishing poles, and nets, and fishing lines to sell or let. He had some to let for three sous an hour. I proposed to uncle George that we should hire two of them and go down and fish a little while." ...|$|E
60|$|There was one {{circumstance}} {{which led}} Ptolemy {{to imagine that}} the Jews would, at that time particularly, be averse to granting any request of such a nature coming from an Egyptian king, and that was, that during certain wars which had taken place in previous reigns, a considerable number of prisoners had been taken by the Egyptians, and had been brought to Egypt as captives, where they had been sold to the inhabitants, and were now scattered over the land as slaves. They were employed as servile laborers in tilling the fields, or in turning enormous wheels <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> water from the Nile. The masters of these hapless bondmen conceived, like other slave-holders, that they had a right of property in their slaves. This was in some respects true, since they had bought them of the government {{at the close of the}} war for a consideration; and though they obviously derived from this circumstance no valid proprietary right or claim as against the men personally, it certainly would seem that it gave them a just claim against the government of whom they bought, in case of subsequent manumission.|$|E

6000|$|... "Guy Waring," [...] {{the young}} man {{interposed}} blandly. Hardly any one who looked at Colonel Kelmscott's eyes could even have perceived the profound surprise this announcement caused him. He bowed without moving a muscle of that military face. Guy himself never noticed the intense emotion the introduction aroused in the distinguished stranger. But Mrs. Clifford and Elma, each scanning him closely with those keen grey eyes of theirs, observed at once that, unmoved as he appeared, a thunderbolt falling at Colonel Kelmscott's feet could not more thoroughly or completely have stunned him. For {{a second or two}} he gazed in {{the young man}}'s face uneasily, his colour came and went, his bosom heaved in silence; then he roped his moustache with his trembling fingers, and tried in vain <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> some harmless remark appropriate to the occasion. But no remark came to him. Mrs. Clifford darted a furtive glance at Elma, and Elma darted back a furtive glance at Mrs. Clifford. Neither said a word, and each let her eyes drop to the ground at once as they met the other's. But each knew in her heart that something passing strange had astonished Colonel Kelmscott; and each knew, too, that the other had observed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "When the dikes {{enclosing}} {{the lake}} were completed, the engineers set up three very powerful steam engines, and gave {{to each one}} ten or twelve enormous pumps to work. These pumping engines were made on such a grand scale that they lifted over sixty tuns of water at every stroke. But yet so large was the lake, and so vast the quantity of water to be drained, that though {{there were three of}} the engines working at this rate, and though they were kept at work night and day, it took them {{a year and a half}} to lay the ground dry. The work was, however, at last accomplished, and now, what was the bottom of the lake is all converted into pastures and green fields. But they still have to keep the pumps going all the time to lift out the surplus water that falls over the whole space in rain. You may judge that the amount is very large that falls on a district thirty miles round. They calculate that the quantity which they have <b>to</b> <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> now, every year, in order to keep the land from being overflowed again, is over fifty millions of tuns. And that is a quantity larger than you can ever conceive of.|$|E

The following experiments have been performed by this model: 1) Determination of aquifer constants by means of separate drawdown tests fromeach aquifer. 2) Measuring the variation of water pressure and the settlement of layers duringthe drawdown test from both aquifers. 3) Measuring the variation of water pressure and the rebound of layers duringthe recharge test into both aquifers. 4) Measuring the behaviour of each layer during the repetition of drawdown. The effect of recharging water into the ground to decrease the subsidence isalso treated in this paper...|$|R
