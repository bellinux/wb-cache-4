5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. <b>The</b> <b>experiences</b> Robinson was {{subjected}} to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. <b>The</b> <b>experiences</b> of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E

5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E

In contrast to other scales, which focus specifically on staff behaviour, the present scale focuses on <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of hospitality offered by the organisation as a whole, also incorporating the physical service environment. The development of the scale consisted of an exploratory phase (two qualitative studies) and a confirmative phase (two quantitative studies). The result is a thirteen-item scale containing three underlying experiential factors of hospitality: <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of welcome, <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of care, and <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of comfort...|$|R

5|$|In the Sikh {{religious}} text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious {{language is}} used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> they have while meditating are ineffable, incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous– {{this means that}} there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised. To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.|$|E
