40|$|Background Chinese herbal {{medicine}} (CHM) is increasingly {{used in the}} West, but the evidence on its effectiveness {{is a matter of}} debate. We compared the characteristics, study quality and results of clinical <b>trials</b> of CHM and conventional medicine. Methods Comparative study of placebo-controlled <b>trials</b> of CHM and conventional medicine. Eleven bibliographic databases and searches by hand of 48 Chinese-language journals. Conventional medicine <b>trials</b> matched for condition and type of outcome were randomly selected from the Cochrane Controlled <b>Trials</b> Register (issue 1, 2003). <b>Trials</b> described as double-blind, with adequate generation of allocation sequence and adequate concealment of allocation, were assumed to be of high quality. Data were analysed using funnel plots and multivariable meta-regression models. Results 136 CHM <b>trials</b> (119 published in Chinese, 17 published in English) and 136 matched conventional medicine <b>trials</b> (125 published in English) were analysed. The quality of Chinese-language CHM <b>trials</b> tended to be lower than that of English-language CHM <b>trials</b> and conventional medicine <b>trials.</b> Three (2 %) CHM <b>trials</b> and 10 (7 %) conventional medicine <b>trials</b> were of high quality. In all groups, smaller <b>trials</b> showed more beneficial treatment effects than larger <b>trials.</b> CHM <b>trials</b> published in Chinese showed considerably larger effects than CHM <b>trials</b> published in English (adjusted ratio of ORs 0. 29, 95 % confidence intervals 0. 17 - 0. 52). Conclusions Biases are present both in placebo-controlled <b>trials</b> of CHM and conventional medicine, but may be most pronounced in CHM <b>trials</b> published in Chinese-language journals. Only few CHM <b>trials</b> of adequate methodology exist and the effectiveness of CHM therefore remains poorly documente...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{goal of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Clinical <b>Trials</b> Program is {{to foster}} {{clinical}} <b>trials</b> that will provide the evidence needed to inform clinical care. The NINDS currently supports clinical research in over 150 neurological disorders. The rapid pace of preclinical discovery and the diversity of neurological diseases, however, present challenges for clinical <b>trials.</b> There is {{a growing number of}} potential interventions to be tested in clinical <b>trials.</b> The NINDS Clinical <b>Trials</b> program is therefore exploring ways of making drug selection for clinical <b>trials</b> more evidence-based. Additionally, NINDS supports pilot clinical <b>trials</b> that focus on the timely and efficient testing of agents to determine if resource-intensive comparative efficacy <b>trials</b> are warranted. In concert with the National Institutes of Health Roadmap, NINDS is planning to expand clinical <b>trials</b> infrastructure. This infrastructure is intended to enable the conduct of clinical <b>trials</b> for rare diseases and diseases without previous <b>trials</b> experience and facilitate the recruitment of a broad range of participants. Rigorous programs to select agents, and design and monitor clinical <b>trials</b> will encourage the efficient use of this clinical <b>trials</b> infrastructure and will ensure that NINDS-funded studies meet the highest scientific and ethical standards...|$|R
30|$|There {{were four}} {{practice}} <b>trials</b> and 24 experimental <b>trials.</b> The practice <b>trials</b> were separated into two blocks (2 D, segmented- 3 D) and the experimental <b>trials</b> were separated into four blocks (two 2 D blocks and two segmented- 3 D blocks) {{with an equal}} number of <b>trials</b> per block. Block order was randomized for the practice. Block order was also randomized for the first two experimental blocks and then again for the last two experimental blocks. The <b>trials</b> in the last two experimental blocks were repeats of the <b>trials</b> from the first two experimental blocks, but in the opposite display type (e.g. the x and y coordinates for targets and distractors in the segmented- 3 D <b>trials</b> from {{the first half of the}} experiment were repeated for the 2 D <b>trials</b> in the second half of the experiment).

30|$|All <b>trials</b> were of {{high risk}} of bias and were not {{sufficiently}} homogenous for meta-analysis. When grouping <b>trials</b> according to injury type, two <b>trials</b> evaluated hamstring injuries, two <b>trials</b> evaluated ankle sprain re-injuries, and four <b>trials</b> were not comparable. No further analyses were conducted owing to differences in study design, intervention, and outcomes across the <b>trials.</b> The two hamstring <b>trials</b> used different interventions, duration of intervention period, and outcomes (injury definition), and also had differences in study design, notably with use of clustering [50, 52]. The ankle <b>trials</b> were not comparable on intervention, outcomes (injury definition), and timing of outcomes [55, 56]. A qualitative analysis was conducted.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock <b>trial</b> instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock <b>trial</b> allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real <b>trial</b> and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} <b>trial</b> simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

Cancellara then rode in support of team leader and eventual Vuelta winner Chris Horner until the seventeenth stage, after which he left the race in order to focus on the World Championships. Cancellara was seen as a contender for the gold medal in both the men's time <b>trial</b> and road race events at the UCI Road World Championships. Cancellara finished the time <b>trial</b> in third position, 48 seconds behind the winner Tony Martin, earning a bronze medal. Four days after completing the time <b>trial</b> event, Cancellara entered the Elite Men's road race.
