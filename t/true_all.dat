25|$|The {{standard}} {{argument against}} free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart {{focuses on the}} implications of determinism for 'free will'. However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is <b>true,</b> <b>all</b> our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.|$|E
25|$|After the births {{of their}} children, Victoria Eugenie's {{relationship}} with Alfonso deteriorated, {{and he had}} numerous affairs. It {{has been said that}} he had a dalliance with the Queen's cousin, Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, but this is disputed. There is some evidence that Alfonso tried to seduce Beatrice, but she didn't give in. The king, in anger, expelled her and her husband from Spain. Then members of the king's circle spread rumours that Beatrice had been expelled because of her bad behaviour, which was not <b>true.</b> <b>All</b> this situation was very painful for the Queen, who could do nothing to help her cousin.|$|E

25|$|MIPS II {{removed the}} load delay slot and added several sets of {{instructions}}. For shared-memory multiprocessing, the Synchronize Shared Memory, Load Linked Word, and Store Conditional Word instructions were added. A set of Trap-on-Condition instructions were added. These instructions caused an exception if the evaluated condition is <b>true.</b> <b>All</b> existing branch instructions were given branch-likely versions that executed the {{instruction in the}} branch delay slot only if the branch is taken. These instructions improve performance in certain cases by allowing useful instructions to fill the branch delay slot. Doubleword load and store instructions for COP1ndash&3 were added. Consistent with other memory access instructions, these loads and stores required the doubleword to be naturally aligned.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the reverse}} topological {{ordering}} and the skew-symmetry, when a literal {{is set to}} <b>true,</b> <b>all</b> literals that can be reached from it via a chain of implications will already have been set to true. Symmetrically, when a literal [...] is set to false, all literals that lead to it via a chain of implications will themselves already have been set to false. Therefore, the truth assignment constructed by this procedure satisfies the given formula, which also completes the proof of correctness of the necessary and sufficient condition identified by Aspvall et al.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come <b>true.</b> <b>All</b> our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} precise modal {{commitments}} of several natural varieties of set-theoretic potentialism, using tools we develop {{for a general}} model-theoretic account of potentialism, building on those of Hamkins, Leibman and Löwe, {{including the use of}} buttons, switches, dials and ratchets. Among the potentialist conceptions we consider are: rank potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> larger V_β); Grothendieck-Zermelo potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> larger V_κ for inaccessible cardinals κ); transitive-set potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> larger transitive sets); forcing potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> forcing extensions); countable-transitive-model potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> larger countable transitive models of ZFC); countable-model potentialism (<b>true</b> in <b>all</b> larger countable models of ZFC); and others. In each case, we identify lower bounds for the modal validities, which are generally either S 4. 2 or S 4. 3, and an upper bound of S 5, proving in each case that these bounds are optimal. The validity of S 5 in a world is a potentialist maximality principle, an interesting set-theoretic principle of its own. The results can be viewed as providing an analysis of the modal commitments of the various set-theoretic multiverse conceptions corresponding to each potentialist account. Comment: 34 pages.

2500|$|Two working {{principles}} underlie {{our decision}} in Twombly. First, the tenet that a court must accept as <b>true</b> <b>all</b> {{of the allegations}} contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. ... Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. ... In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they {{are no more than}} conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Our decision in Twombly illustrates the two-pronged approach.|$|E
