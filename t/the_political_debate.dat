5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|After Lillehammer {{was awarded}} the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became {{necessary}} to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, {{as part of a}} broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. Originally the administration had suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall, after Haakon Haakonarson, later king of Norway, while the smaller hall would be named Sveres Hall, for Sverre Sigurdsson. During <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate,</b> a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall, for Sigurdsson's daughter Kristina Sverresdotter, which was passed by the city council. Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics. Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years, including an upgrade in 2007 which included new ice hockey sideboards, a new ice machine, a new lighting system, and a new handball floor.|$|E

This book answers to this question by presenting the evolution of the public spaces in a historical perspective, by defining and operationalizing the deliberative criteria of democracy, and by measuring and evaluating the impact of virtualization of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debates</b> under threes perspectives. It looks at the extent to which different categories of the population debate online, it looks at the categories of actors hosting online political forum, and it assesses the quality of <b>the</b> online <b>political</b> <b>debates</b> in different contexts. The final aim of this work is to provide a more balanced evaluation of the impact of virtualization of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debates</b> and to enrich the evolving deliberative theory with new findings...|$|R

Both {{before and after the}} Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified.|$|E

Although the old restraints on the sectional tensions were being eroded with the rapid extension of mass politics and mass democracy in the North, the perpetuation of conflict over the issue of slavery in the West still required the efforts of radical Democrats in the South and radical Republicans in the North.

40|$|The {{normative}} {{literature on}} fiscal federalism generally recognises {{the need for}} fiscal equalisation mechanisms to facilitate the mitigation of inequities {{in the distribution of}} resources. The question of how far to go in matters of fiscal equalisation is a very sensitive one.

Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debates</b> are characterised by the usual tensions between selfish and altruistic visions of society. The empirical part of this contribution analyses the results of two referenda recently held in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It provides explanatory models for both ballots (acceptance rate of the propositions in each municipality). The model’s explanatory variables show that the people of Vaud’s voting behaviour was basically selfish. The widespread belief that voters are capable of altruism in this particular area is, therefore, rejected. ...|$|R

25|$|During Luzzatti's {{government}} <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> {{had begun}} {{to focus on the}} enlargement of the right to vote. The Socialists, in fact, but also the Radicals and the Republicans, has long demanded the introduction of universal manhood suffrage, necessary in a modern liberal democracy. Luzzatti developed a moderate proposal with some requirements under which a person had the right to vote (age, literacy and annual taxes). The government's proposal was of a gradual expansion of the electorate, but without reaching the universal male suffrage.|$|E
25|$|But it is {{possible}} that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate).</b> David Herbert Donald (1920–2009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in a society in which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{opposition}} to both democratic and socialist samizdat, Slavophile samizdat grouped democracy and socialism together as Western ideals which were unsuited to the Eastern European mentality. Slavophile samizdat brought a nationalistic Russian perspective to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> and espoused {{the importance of}} cultural diversity and the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. Samizdat written from the Slavophile perspective attempted to unite the USSR under {{a vision of a}} shared glorious history of Russian autocracy and Orthodoxy. Consequently, the fact that the USSR encompassed a diverse range of nationalities and lacked a singular Russian history hindered the Slavophile movement. By espousing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority through either purity of blood or the strength of the Russian Orthodoxy, the Slavophile movement in samizdat alienated readers and created divisions within the opposition.|$|E

The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President – the so-called Ciampi-bis – was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before his mandate expired. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, Giorgio Napolitano.|$|E
25|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} to Brevik were first put forward in 1875, {{but not until}} 4 July 1891 did Parliament pass {{legislation}} to build the line. With national funding secured, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> moved {{to the location of}} the station in Brevik. Locations at Setretangen and Strømtangen were proposed. Setretangen would give a station closer to the village center, while Strømtangen would give access to docks which had less ice during winter. A public meeting was called in January 1892 by the proponents of the former to secure public support. As the public seemed to support Strømtangen, the organizers never let the issue come to a vote. The issue was then discussed in the municipal council's executive board, where four against one members supported the Strømtangen alternative. The location was finally decided by the municipal council on 25 June 1892, when sixteen against four aldermen voted in favor of Strømtangen, and subsequently approved by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).|$|E
25|$|Despite Crispi's resounding {{victory at}} the general {{elections}} in May 1895, the scandal would backfire against him. On July 24, the Government decided to present Giolitti's evidence {{about the role of}} Crispi in the scandal and other matters to the Chamber of Deputies and to have a special commission examine them. In June 1895, the French newspaper Le Figaro published documents compromising Crispi, showing evidence that he had concealed from the 1893 parliamentary inquiry financial transactions and debts contracted by Crispi, his family and friends with the Banca Romana. Giolitti regained much of his prestige after <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>debate</b> in December 1895 when the Chamber declined to indict Giolitti, who had asked to be brought for the Senate. The scandal was now hurriedly buried after nearly three years. Most of the shortcomings had been political negligence rather than criminal but the uproar about bribes and cover-ups had discredited political and banking institutions and the reputation of politicians. The prestige of both Crispi and Giolitti was tarnished substantially, favouring the so-called Extreme Left headed by Cavallotti.|$|E

Alexander Hamilton led the faction which viewed the revolution with skepticism and sought to preserve existing commercial ties with Great Britain. When news reached America that France had declared war on the British, people were divided on whether the U.S. should enter the war on the side of France. Jefferson and his faction wanted to aid the French, while Hamilton and his followers supported neutrality in the conflict.
