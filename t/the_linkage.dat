Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated {{to a large extent}} by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E

25|$|Both PS and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can {{regulate}} membrane mechanical function, due {{to their}} interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4.1R.

25|$|In {{the process}} {{described}} above, {{the fact that}} the first hypercycles originated from the quasispecies population (a population of similar sequences) created a significant advantage. One possibility of linking different chains I—which is relatively easy to achieve taking into account the quasispecies properties—is that the one chain I improves the synthesis of the similar chain I. In this way, the existence of similar sequences I originating from the same quasispecies population promotes the creation of <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> between molecules I and I.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-based biopolymers {{are often}} {{difficult}} {{with regards to}} convention. Sugar polymers can be linear or branched and are typically joined with glycosidic bonds. The exact placement of <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> can vary, and {{the orientation of the}} linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as amination, and can even form parts of other molecules, such as glycoproteins.|$|E

40|$|Linkage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors for gaining competitive advantage. Information on linkages is essential to understanding the structure of an economy, which is in turn important in formulating industry policies and business strategies. The hypothetical extraction method is used to measure <b>the</b> <b>linkages</b> by extracting a sector hypothetically from an economic system in the literature. In the previous research, however, <b>the</b> internal <b>linkage</b> (linkage within a sector) and sectoral linkages (linkage between two specific sectors) are ignored, and there is not a comprehensive framework to measure <b>the</b> <b>linkages</b> of a specific sector. Using the recently published Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development input-output database at constant prices, this paper aims to resolve these two shortcomings and thereby propose a linkage measure framework to explore <b>the</b> <b>linkages</b> between <b>the</b> real estate sector and other sectors from a new angle. The relative and absolute linkages are termed and the total, backward, forward, internal and sectoral linkage indicators are formulated to investigate <b>the</b> <b>linkages</b> of <b>the</b> real estate sector from all directions. Empirical results show an increasing trend of these <b>linkages,</b> which confirms <b>the</b> increasing role of the real estate sector with economic maturity over the examined period. This framework also can be employed in other sectors...|$|R

25|$|Exploring {{the immune}} system's HLA alleles, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that HLA-B*73 introgressed from Denisovans into modern humans in western Asia due to the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles. In modern humans, HLA-B*73 is concentrated in western Asia, but it is rare or absent elsewhere. Even though HLA-B*73 is not present in the sequenced Denisovan genome, the study noted that it was associated to the Denisovan-derived HLA-C*15:05 from <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium, consistent with the estimated 98% of those modern humans who carried B*73 also carried C*15:05.|$|E
