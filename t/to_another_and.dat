5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> voted early and often.|$|E

Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of Memphis and Letopolis, were overseen by the same high priest.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{characteristics}} of each building that are distinctly English, these cathedrals {{are marked by}} their architectural diversity, both from one <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> also within each individual building. This is much more the case than in the medieval cathedrals of Northern France, for example, where the cathedrals and large abbeys form a relatively homogenous group and the architectural development can easily be traced from building to building.|$|E

5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record <b>to</b> <b>another)</b> <b>and</b> scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E

5|$|New Jerseys guns {{opened the}} first shore {{bombardment}} of her Korean career at Wonsan 20 May. During her two {{tours of duty}} in Korean waters, she was {{again and again to}} play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, New Jersey used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>and</b> at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and received a near miss aft to port.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number can be compared <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>and</b> includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods {{away from the city}} center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The mayor's main duties are {{to liaise}} with the {{municipal}} council, district councils {{and the entire}} administrative apparatus of the canton, and to approve and implement the decisions taken by the municipal council. The number {{of members of the}} municipal council varies from one canton <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>and</b> they are elected by local elections held every four years. The head of the council is titled the municipal president (presidente municipal). The council's main task is to manage the canton at the local level, and is responsible for planning basic policies and establishing budgets. More specifically, the responsibilities include urban and agricultural planning and organizing cultural affairs, health care, education and industry. Each municipal president appoints a number of working commissions that deal with issues specific to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>and</b> allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>and</b> by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
