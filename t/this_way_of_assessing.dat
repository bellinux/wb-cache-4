40|$|Abstract Over {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the question of whether computer programs are capable of genuinely creative activity. Although this notion can be explored as a purely philosophical debate, an alternative per-spective is to consider what aspects of the behaviour of a program might be noted or measured in order to arrive at an empirically supported judgement that creativity has occurred. We sketch out, in general abstract terms, what goes on when a potentially creative program is constructed and run, and list some of the relationships (for example, between input and output) which might contribute to a decision about creativity. Specifically, we list a number of criteria which might indicate interesting properties of a program’s behaviour, from the perspective of possible creativity. We go on to review some ways in which these criteria have been applied to actual implementations, and some possible improvements to <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> crea-tivity...|$|E

40|$|Testing multi-agent {{systems is}} a challenge, since by {{definition}} such systems are distributed, {{and are able}} to exhibit autonomous and flexible behaviour.

40|$|In many {{biological}} processes heterogeneity within clonal cell populations {{is an important}} issue. One {{of the most striking}} examples is a population of cancer cells in which after a common, identical death signal some cells die whereas others survive. The reason for this heterogeneity is intrinsic and extrinsic noise. In this paper we present a mechanistic multi-scale modeling framework for cell populations, in which the dynamics of every individual cell is captured by a parameter dependent stochastic differential equation (SDE). Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences in parameter values, modeling extrinsic influences. Based on the statistical properties of the extrinsic noise and the SDE model for the individual cell, a partial differential equation (PDE) model is derived. This PDE describes the evolution of the population density. To determine the statistics of the extrinsic noise from experimental population data, a densitybased statistical data model of the noise-corrupted data is derived. Employing this data model we show that the statistics of the extrinsic can be computed using a convex optimization. <b>This</b> efficient <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> the parameters allows for a so far infeasible uncertainty analysis via bootstrapping. To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade is considered.

40|$|During the 2008 presidential campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama stated: “Sometimes, the {{preventive}} use {{of force}} may be necessary, but rarely.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{whether a}} five-year time limit on welfare participation encourages behaviors {{that lead to}} less reliance on public assistance. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, it describes young women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions about childbearing, schooling, working and welfare participation over time. The parameters underlying these decisions are estimated by fitting the model to data on observed choices obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Estimation is done using a simulated maximum likelihood procedure. Parameter estimates are used to simulate choices under current policy and under a policy of a five-year time limit on welfare participation. <b>This</b> provides a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> effects <b>of</b> the time limit. The results suggest that a time limit has {{a significant impact on}} the behavior of those at highest risk for welfare participation. When faced with a time limit, they have fewer children, work and attend school more and rely on less welfare. In fact, a time limit leads to shorter-term welfare participation, apart from the purely 2 ̆ 2 mechanical 2 ̆ 2 effect of making long-term recipients categorically ineligible. Thus a time limit does encourage self-sufficiency in the sense that individuals rely more on other sources of support. At the same time, it appears that the shift occurs towards sources of support other than full-time work to a greater extent than towards full-time school attendance or full-time work. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of an operational and theoretically eclectic concept of psychological well-being. A comprehensive research strategy was employed to examine various personality factors thought to be components of psychological health (i. e., the basis of the proposed concept). The general approach involved four major phases: (1) the clustering of various variables and identification of underlying key factors purported to be related to psychological health based on the writer's clinical experience and review of the mental health literature, (2) the formulation of an ~ priori concept of psychological well-being based on the operational definition of those factors, (3) the construction of an inventory designed to examine the proposed concept, and (4) the interpretation of the results and their implications {{for the development of the}} overall concept based on the examination of the factorial structure, validity and reliability of the inventory. The"a posteriori concept" evolved out of this process. The results of the present study indicate that the most valid and reliable factorial components of psychological well-being are self regard,interpersonal relationship, independence, problem-solving, assertiveness,reality testing, stress tolerance, self-actualization and happiness; social responsibility and flexibility emerged as questionable components of the a posteriori concept. The inventory which was designed to study the concept was successful in significantly differentiating various levels <b>of</b> psychological health. <b>This</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> conceptualizing and <b>assessing</b> psychological well-being has potential applicability for mental health practitioners and researchers...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{spaces are}} an {{experience}} {{for all the}} senses, but all too often, academics and designers are interested in only the visual or aural aspects of place. What {{are the implications of}} a more holistic approach {{to the role of the}} senses in our experience of urban space? <b>This</b> paper investigates <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> the multi-sensory quality of urban spaces. One important task is to find <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> recording sensory experience, as individualistic and variable as it can be. The paper describes a notational system depicting the relative importance, corroboration, and qualities, of six perceptual systems in the tradition of James J. Gibson's (1966) groundbreaking work. The notational system is demonstrated with a series of notations of spaces in Rome. Such a notational system can be used as an individualistic exercise akin to sketching, but has a number of wider uses as well, such as the diagnosis of sensory deficits across a site or route. This research draws on a wide literature, from the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty (1962) through Ingold's anthropology of the environment (2000, 2007 a). The work of James J. Gibson on the contextual nature of perception (1966) is central to the research, enlarged by more literary approaches from Georges Perec (1974), Michel deCerteau, Gaston Bachelard and Henri Lefebvre's Rhythmanalysis. This research puts these more open, subjective theories of environmental perception into practice by embedding them in a set of inscriptive practices, allowing them to become part of the design process...|$|R
40|$|The {{start of}} the twenty-first century {{witnessed}} the flourishing of both the biosciences (particularly genomics) and initiatives around public engagement in science, particularly in the UK and USA. STS researchers have both followed and fuelled this latter trend. Hence, it may be helpful to review the genealogy of these recent developments and of STS concern for the publics of science. <b>This</b> provides a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> whether STS activities have been contributing to making the sciences more open and accountable to their publics. One trail returns to the institutionalisation of Public Understanding of Science (PUS) in the mid- 1980 s. The critique of this movement by STS scholars through reference to the deficit model (of public understanding of science) also figures here. However, less attention has been given to other modes of conceptualising science and publics, including what Cooter and Pumfrey label as the ‘diffusionist’ or ‘diffusion’ model (of scientific knowledge), which they contend entrenched traditional views of scientific knowledge and of publics as receivers of such knowledge. More recently, investigations of the making of science in diverse locations, attention to multiplicity and co-production have taken STS in new directions. Nevertheless, the legacies of both the deficit and diffusion models of science and publics continue to influence STS and its ‘regimes of truth’. Questions remain around STS researchers' persistent failure to acknowledge the diffusion model, in particular, and the consequent retrenchment of traditional views of how science works, limiting prospects for substantial public engagement and more open, democratic modes of science...|$|R
40|$|In 1998 {{the current}} {{reform of the}} General Education System (GES) started in Oman. Redefining the {{existing}} or finding a suitable new school leadership model has become important to enable Omani primary headteachers to redefine and transform the existing practice of school leadership and to implement and integrate the new educational and leadership tasks which were introduced by the current reform. Studies indicate that educational reforms generally require a powerful mechanism to get things done. Thus, Omani educators (policy makers and headteachers) face a challenge in redefining the present model or choosing a suitable new one. One of the two is, however, urgently required to reform the practice of school leadership in Omani primary schools. Therefore, this research focuses on both redefining and transforming the existing practice and implementing the new tasks (in possibly a new form) of school leadership. This research focuses mainly on three major themes, as follows: (1) The historical background which underlies primary school leadership in Oman. (2) The current practice of primary school leadership. (3) Redefining the existing school leadership model or choosing a new one to develop more effective primary school leadership and ensure {{the success of the}} current development of the GES in Oman. Therefore, this research project concentrates on an examination and evaluation of the current practice of primary school management and leadership in the country’s primary schools. Furthermore, this research evaluates the practice of leadership in schools by collecting the necessary data (in a subjective approach) and by using a specially constructed scale (in an objective approach) based on transactional and transformational theories of school leadership. <b>This</b> provides a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessing</b> to what extent the current practice of primary school leadership is effective or not in terms of these theories.
