40|$|Previous {{field and}} {{glasshouse}} studies suggested that oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) was especially sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency {{in the recovery}} period following <b>transplanting.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} whether <b>transplanting,</b> per se, or root damage during <b>transplanting</b> was primarily responsible. Three glasshouse experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that <b>transplanting</b> increases external Zn requirement of canola cv. Hyola 42 during its post-transplanting recovery. Canola was either directly sown into Zn-treated soils or <b>transplanted</b> at four-leaf stage, and grown until harvest at 7 - and 10 -leaf stages. In a second experiment with chelate-buffered solution culture, direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> plants were treated with three concentrations of Zn. In the third experiment, plants were given three levels of Zn supply, and either direct-sown into soils or <b>transplanted</b> at four-leaf stage with pruned (50 % of roots removed) or unpruned root systems. <b>Transplanted</b> plants required higher soil Zn supply for maximum root length and root dry weight than direct-sown plants. By contrast, shoots required similarly low external Zn for maximum dry weight in both direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> plants in soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing soil supplied Zn than <b>transplanted</b> plants particularly compared to those <b>transplanted</b> with a pruned root system, and achieved maximum growth at 100 μg Zn kg- 1 soil compared to 500 μg Zn kg- 1 required by <b>transplanted</b> plants. Since the higher external Zn requirement for the growth of <b>transplanted</b> plants was also obtained in well-stirred solution culture, it was concluded that it was related to the time required for <b>transplanted</b> plants to recover from root injury and re-establish a favourable shoot: root ratio rather than to rhizosphere modification processes.

The study was carried out over two seasons, the 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003 seasons at Save Valley Experiment Station in a semi arid area of Zimbabwe. There were three factors in the experiment, three nursery sowing dates (2 November-SD 1; 12 November-SD 2 and 22 November-SD 3), variety and method of planting (direct or <b>transplanting).</b> Varieties used were PMV 2 and PMV 3. The design was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial in a Randomised Complete Block Design replicated three times. Seeds of the two varieties were also sown on the day of <b>transplanting</b> (12 December-SD 4) resulting in two additional treatments. Days to flowering and maturity, dry weight, grains per panicle, 1000 seed weight and grain yield (kg ha - 1) were measured. There were significant sowing date x planting method interactions on time to flowering and maturity. <b>Transplanting</b> increased time to flowering and maturity while delayed sowing decreased time to flowering and maturity. <b>Transplants</b> had lesser dry weights compared to non-transplants though relative growth rate appeared to be the same between <b>transplants</b> and non-transplants. In the 2001 / 2002 season there was a significant (p< 0. 05) interaction between Sowing Date (SD) and planting method on yield. Thirty and 40 -day-old <b>transplants</b> performed better than 20 -day-old <b>transplants.</b> For non-transplants, delayed sowing reduced yields by about 900 kg ha - 1 from SD 1 to SD 4.

40|$|<b>Transplanting</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} for many horticultural crops and some field crops. Recently, <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops {{have been reported to}} be sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency. However, Zn nutrition in <b>transplanted</b> field crops has not been investigated in detail. The objectives of this present research were to investigate whether <b>transplanting</b> increases external Zn requirements of <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape, and the mechanisms of root function, growth and Zn uptake after <b>transplanting</b> including rhizosphere modification capacity by plant roots. The second objective was to examine the relative effects of root pruning and <b>transplanting</b> on Zn responses of oilseed rape, and the third objective was to determine external and internal Zn requirements of <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape for diagnosing and predicting Zn deficiency. An experiment on a low Zn sand (DTPA extractable Zn 0. 14 mg kg- 1) was set up to determine whether <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape had a higher Zn requirement than that of direct-sown plants. Low Zn supply depressed shoot dry weight, however, root growth was relatively more strongly suppressed than shoots. Maximum root dry weight required much higher external Zn for <b>transplanted</b> plants compared to direct-sown plants, whilst shoot dry weight required a similarly low external Zn supply. In addition, <b>transplanted</b> plants were sensitive to zinc deficiency during the early post-transplanting growth, and the response weakened as the plants recovered from root injury or <b>transplanting</b> stress. However, the <b>transplanted</b> plants also experienced root pruning before <b>transplanting</b> and so in this experiment the higher Zn requirement could have been due to root pruning or <b>transplanting</b> or both. A further experiment was undertaken to determine the comparative external Zn requirements of direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> plants in well-stirred chelate-buffered solution culture where a rhizosphere effect on plant availability of Zn forms is absent and the effects of poor root-soil contact on post-transplanting growth are minimized. In solution culture at the same level of Zn supplied, direct- sown plants produced higher shoot and root dry matter and greater root length than those of <b>transplanted</b> plants. However, since a higher external Zn requirement was found for <b>transplanted</b> plants in buffered solution culture than for direct- sown plants, it was concluded that the higher Zn requirement was not related to decreased rhizosphere modification, to greater demand for Zn or to poor root-solution contact, but rather to the time required for <b>transplanted</b> plants to recover from <b>transplanting</b> and root injury. The recovery of root function in solution culture was more rapid than that in soil culture and expressed as a higher Zn requirement for shoot as well as root growth. It suggested that the delay in root recovery in soil culture was due to slower absorption of Zn from the soil after <b>transplanting</b> than was the case in solution culture. Chelate-buffered nutrient solution culture and harvesting plants successively at 5 day intervals until 25 days after <b>transplanting</b> was used to examine the mechanisms of the recovery of root growth and function. In this experiment, the external Zn requirement of <b>transplanted</b> plants was investigated with unpruned or pruned root systems. Plants with unpruned root system and sufficient Zn supply exhibited faster recovery from <b>transplanting</b> than those with pruned root system plants. The results suggest that root pruning impaired Zn uptake by plant roots and slowed down the root and shoot growth after <b>transplanting.</b> Increased solution Zn partly alleviated the effects of root pruning and presumably this is a major reason why <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape had a high external Zn requirement. However, root pruning also appeared to impair water uptake, and may have suppressed shoot growth through sequestering carbon for new root growth and through decreased phytohormone production by roots. Since rapid root recovery of <b>transplanted</b> plants is essential for successful of growth in the field, Zn application to the nursery bed was explored as a starter fertilizer to stimulate root growth after <b>transplanting.</b> The objective of this experiment was to determine whether increasing the seedbed Zn would stimulate new root growth of <b>transplanted</b> oilseed rape, and therefore would alleviate the need for increased external Zn for post-transplanting growth. Results showed that adequate Zn concentration in the seedbed promoted the post-transplanting growth by stimulating the new root growth especially increased root length, and also hastened the recovery of root systems. However, high Zn concentration at <b>transplanting</b> still had a more dominant effect in stimulating the new root growth of oilseed rape after <b>transplanting.</b> The final experiment was set up using rhizobags with three rates of Zn supply and unpruned or pruned root systems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the chemical change in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere or bulk soil and its relationship to the recovery of root function after <b>transplanting,</b> and also to identify and quantify the organic acids in soil extracts of direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> plants. The rhizosphere soil pH was lower than that of non-rhizosphere soil, and the decrease of soil pH was suggested as the mechanism of the increase of Zn availability and mobility in the rhizosphere soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing Zn than those of <b>transplanted</b> plants especially compared to those of plants with pruned root system. Zinc deficient plants excreted higher concentration of organic acids particularly citric acid, suggesting this was a mechanism of Zn mobilization and Zn uptake by roots of oilseed rape. The main implications of the present study for the management of Zn nutrition of <b>transplanted</b> crops were: the need to increase the Zn application to crops in the nursery and at <b>transplanting</b> compared to direct-sown plants; the possibility that external requirements of other nutrients will be greater in <b>transplanted</b> crops also requires further consideration; and in cropping systems where <b>transplanting</b> is practised, greater attention should be given to the avoidance of root damage during the <b>transplanting...</b>|$|R

The results of analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences among different <b>transplanting</b> dates for all agronomic traits and grain yield at 1 % probability levels.

The highest grain yield (with an average of 3975. 2 kg. ha- 1) was obtained at 1 st of July <b>transplanting</b> date.
