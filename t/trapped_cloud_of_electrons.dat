50|$|The basic {{element of}} the common ion pump is a Penning <b>trap.</b> A {{swirling}} <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> produced by an electric discharge is temporarily stored in the anode region of a Penning trap. These electrons ionize incoming gas atoms and molecules. The resultant swirling ions are accelerated to strike a chemically active cathode (usually titanium). On impact the accelerated ions will either become buried within the cathode or sputter cathode material onto {{the walls of the}} pump. The freshly sputtered chemically active cathode material acts as a getter that then evacuates the gas by both chemisorption and physisorption resulting in a net pumping action. Inert and lighter gases, such as He and H2 tend not to sputter and are absorbed by physisorption. Some fraction of the energetic gas ions (including gas that is not chemically active with the cathode material) can strike the cathode and acquire an electron from the surface, neutralizing it as it rebounds. These rebounding energetic neutrals are buried in exposed pump surfaces.|$|R

Furthermore we observe in the simulations a resonant energy exchange between the radial and axial trap dimensions {{at a ratio of}} trap frequencies ω_r / ω_z = 3 / 2.

Using random phase and local density approximations we produce both trap averaged and spatially resolved spectra, identifying simple {{features in the}} spectra that reveal information about both superfluidity and correlations. Our approach is exact in the deep Mott limit and in the deep superfluid when the hopping rates for the two internal spin states are equal. It contains final state interactions, obeys the Ward identities (and the associated conservation laws), and satisfies the f-sum rule. Motivated by earlier work by Sun, Lannert, and Vishveshwara [Phys. Rev. A 79, 043422 (2009) ], we also discuss the features which arise in a spin-dependent optical lattice.
