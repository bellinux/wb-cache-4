The infiltrated length was found to be linear function of pressure and square-root function of time. The effect of the infiltration parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of MMSFs were investigated by optical microscopy and standardised compression tests. The microscopic images were used to qualify the pressure infiltration and showed that more than one combination of infiltration parameters can be found for successful production of a part with given required dimensions. Considering the compression tests, the main characterising properties were mapped as function of infiltration parameters. The registered values showed dependency on the infiltration parameters and indicated that a given infiltration length produced by higher pressure and shorter time has better mechanical properties. The infiltrated specimens were isotropic, anisotropy was not observed in the reference measurements...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Additive {{manufacture}} (AM) such as {{selective laser}} melting (SLM) provides significant geometric design freedom in comparison with traditional manufacturing methods. Such freedom enables the construction of injection moulding tools with conformal cooling channels that optimize heat transfer while incorporating efficient internal lattice structures that can ground loads and provide thermal insulation. Despite the opportunities enabled by AM, there remain a number of design and processing uncertainties associated with the application of SLM <b>to</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> tool manufacture, in particular from H 13 /DIN 1. 2344 steel as commonly used in injection moulds. This paper aims to address several associated uncertainties. Design/methodology/approach A number of physical and numerical experimental studies are conducted to quantify SLM-manufactured H 13 material properties, part manufacturability and part characteristics. Findings Findings are presented which quantify the effect of SLM processing parameters on the density of H 13 steel components; the manufacturability of standard and self-supporting conformal cooling channels, as well as structural lattices in H 13; the surface roughness of SLM-manufactured cooling channels; the effect of cooling channel layout on the associated stress concentration factor and cooling uniformity; and the structural and thermal insulating properties {{of a number of}} structural lattices. Originality/value The contributions of this work with regards to SLM manufacture of H 13 of injection mould tooling can be applied in the design of conformal cooling channels and lattice structures for increased thermal performance...|$|E
40|$|<b>To</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> polymers, {{designing}} mould {{is a key}} task involving several critical {{decisions with}} direct implications to yield quality, productivity and frugality. One prominent decision among them is specifying sprue-bush conduit expansion as it significantly influences overall injection moulding; abstruseness anguish in its design criteria deceives direct determination. Intuitively designers decide it wisely and then exasperate by optimising or manipulating processing parameters. To overwhelm that anomaly this research aims at proposing an ideal design criteria holistically for all polymeric materials also tend as a functional assessment metric towards perfection i. e., criteria to specify sprue conduit size before mould development. Accordingly, a priori analytical criterion was deduced quantitatively as expansion ratio from ubiquitous empirical relationships specifically a. k. a an exclusive expansion angle imperatively configured for injectant properties. Its computational intelligence advantage was leveraged to augment functionality of perfectly injecting into an impression gap, while synchronising both injector capacity and desired moulding features. For comprehensiveness, it was continuously sensitised over infinite scale as an explicit factor dependent on in-situ spatio-temporal injectant state perplexity with discrete slope and altitude for each polymeric character. In which congregant ranges of apparent viscosity and shear thinning index were conceived to characteristically assort most thermoplastics. Thereon results accorded aggressive conduit expansion widening for viscous incrust, while a very aggressive narrowing for shear thinning encrust; among them apparent viscosity had relative dominance. This important rationale would certainly form a priori design basis as well diagnose filling issues causing several defects. Like this the proposed generic design criteria, being simple would immensely benefit mould designers besides serve as an inexpensive preventive cliché to moulders. Its adaption ease to practice manifests a hope of injection moulding extremely alluring polymers. Therefore, we concluded that appreciating injectant׳s polymeric character to design exclusive sprue bush offers a definite a priori advantage...|$|E

It was {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B : Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© Professional Engineering Publishing] and is available at [URL] use of stereolithography (SL) parts as injection moulding tools offers many advantages over traditional tool making approaches. In particular, the time required to convert a computer aided design (CAD) file to the final tool is dramatically reduced as may be the costs in creating the tool. However, the process has been perceived to have a number of drawbacks which are, in the main, associated with the poor thermal and mechanical properties of the SL resins. Research was performed which involved the production and use of an SL tool <b>to</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> a series of parts in polypropylene. Measurements were made of the forces required to eject parts from the tool in order to assess the possibility of tensile tool failure during part ejection. The measured forces were compared with predicted values which had been calculated using previously devised equations. In addition, temperatures were recorded throughout the injection moulding cycle to assess the tool's strength at different times. Surface roughness measurements were also taken to characterize the ejection process more closely and observe any changes to surface roughness caused by moulding parts. A finite element analysis was made of the heat transfer in the tool to help with prediction of ejection forces. Measurements of ejection forces and heat transfer indicated that, contrary to existing recommendations, part ejection should be performed shortly after injection. Accurate predictions of ejection force were shown to be unattainable given the difficulty in finding accurate values for the variables used in the force prediction equations. Measurements of heat transfer coupled with surface roughness suggested that the low thermal properties of SL tools actually work in favour of the process rather than against it. This conceptual about-turn regarding the role of thermal properties in SL injection moulding tools indicates that further benefits may be derived from the new technology...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of the research}} described in this thesis is to assess the technical feasibility of pneumatic tyres for passenger cars which have no directional reinforcement in their carcasses. Conventional tyres are constructed from composites of twisted textile or steel cords in a rubber matrix, a process which is both labour intensive and costly. If it were possible <b>to</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> or cast tyre carcasses in a single operation, and if the performance of the resulting tyres matched that of modern radial ply tyres, then the implications for the tyre industry would be of major proportions. After reviewing the history of pneumatic tyres and summarising their principal attributes, the design of unreinforced or fabricless tyres is investigated and methods developed for defining their meridional profiles. Materials suitable for their carcasses and treads are then considered, prior to describing the manufacture of two series of tyres designed to have section height to width ratios, or aspect ratios, of 0. 9 and 0. 7 respectively. To facilitate experimental work, two sizes of tyres were employed: half scale models for which testing procQdures had been developed previously; and a size suitable for small saloon cars. The results obtained on a range of tyre properties are presented and analysed to give a number of empirical relationships between the properties and the design variables: carcass material Young's modulus, carcass wall thickness and the inflation pressure. For the important property of radial stiffness which affects other tyre characteristics, an improved method of analysis is developed to allow the structural and pneumatic components to be quantified. Using the relationships established experimentally, consideration is given to optimising the design of a fabricless tyre. It is concluded that to approach the performance of a conventional tyre, a design with a low aspect ratio is preferred but, to restrict growth with inflation'pressure, limited directional reinforcement must be included as a circumferential-belt beneath the tread. Nevertheless, the discussion concludes that there are fundamental reasons why even the optimised tyre would be unacceptable for use on modern passenger cars, although less demanding applications may be identified...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces for many scientific and commercial applications including the fields of cell and tissue engineering, where {{the study of the}} ways that cells interact with their environment holds great potential for the future of regenerative medicine. Current replication based fabrication techniques, such as hot embossing, which are used to produce nanostructured surfaces for this type of research are not fast enough {{to keep up with the}} growing demand for them. Injection moulding offers a high throughput alternative to these processes and can upscale the production of nanopatterned samples by several orders of magnitude. However, the nickel moulds traditionally used <b>to</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> micro- and nanostructures are limited to producing recessed features due to the rate at which the injected polymer cools upon contact with it. In order to replicate raised features (e. g. pillars) the polymer needs enough time to fill the nanoscale cavities of the mould before freezing. A solution to this limitation of nickel tooling is devised and implemented, using a thermally insulating tooling material that facilitates the formation of nanopillars by injection moulding. This tooling material can be patterned by a range of fabrication techniques including photolithography and nanoimprint lithography. The tooling can be used to replicate nanopatterns over underlying micron and millimetre scale topographies. This flexible solution enables the large volume production of samples containing raised poly(carbonate) nanopillars without significantly compromising cycle time. Following this, the technique is adapted in an attempt to replicate high aspect ratio nanostructures. In this section a range of non-adhesive surface coatings are tested for their abilities to enhance the replication process through the systematic analysis of their durability and the replication fidelity that they enable. Nanopillars with aspect ratios of greater than 10 : 1 are successfully produced and are used to fabricate surfaces for cell engineering research. This success is also demonstrative of the technique’s potential to mass produce nanostructures for other applications such as non-reflective and dry adhesive surfaces. Finally, a study is undertaken to replicate microstructures with an elastomeric polymer. The tooling solution is used to assess the minimum feature size that can be replicated with this polymer and how processing parameters and non-adhesive coatings can improve this. This thesis documents the development of a range of enabling techniques which add to the existing toolbox of nanofabrication technologies. They address a growing demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces in cell and tissue engineering research, whilst remaining open and adaptable to any application that requires the high throughput production of nanopatterned polymeric samples...|$|E

40|$|Conventional urea-based {{moulding}} compounds {{for investment}} casting patterns are manufactured using a slow “cooking” process. Nowadays in industrial processes {{the use of}} a faster process is highly recommended to increase throughput levels. At the same time, for quality control purposes, the requirements of an investment caster must be met. This study is therefore focused on: Finding the appropriate conventional process and conditions to prepare urea-based investment casting moulding compounds. Optimising the composition variables to meet the mechanical, thermal, surface, flow and cost properties needed in investment casting. Characterising the moulding compounds to meet the requirements of an investment caster by comparing them with an industrial, “cooked” urea-based compound. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) urea-based moulding compounds were prepared using a two-roll mill and a conventional extrusion processes respectively. It was possible <b>to</b> <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> PVOH urea-based moulding compounds with a urea content of up to 90 wt % which had been compounded using a two-roll mill. Using the conventional extrusion process, it was also possible to compound and injection mould EVA urea-based moulding compounds containing up to 70 wt % urea. The effects on composition variables on the properties of the moulding compound were studied and compared to those of the existing “cooked” urea-based moulding compound (Benchmark). The mechanical properties were characterised using the three-point bending test and Charpy impact test. The thermal properties were determined using simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (SDTA/TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The thermo-mechanical and visco-elastic properties were determined using a dynamic mechanical analyser. A scanning electron microscope was used to study the surface texture of the mouldings. The EVA urea-based moulding compounds showed two endothermic melting peaks and multiple exothermic crystallisation peaks in the DSC curves. The peak at ca. 55 - 66 °C corresponds to the melting of the wax/EVA blend, while the large peak at 130 - 132 °C corresponds to the melting of the urea. The DSC heating curve of the PVOH urea-based moulding compounds showed two endothermic peaks. The small peak corresponds to the melting of the wax, while the large peak corresponds to the melting of the urea/PVOH blend. PVOH urea-based moulding compound had better mechanical properties than the industrial benchmark. The mechanical properties of the EVA urea-based compound were generally lower. The effect of the wax and polymer content on the mechanical properties was as follows: Increasing polymer content produced weaker but tougher moulding compounds. Increasing wax content improved the strength and stiffness but gave compounds that were less tough. Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated significant polymer-wax interactions. The urea content determined the stiffness (elastic modulus) of the compounds. PVOH mouldings had superior stiffness compared with the EVA and cooked urea-based mouldings. The Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results confirmed the result obtained from the modulus of elasticity determination in the three-point bending test. The impact strength increased with an increase in polymer content and reduced with an increase in wax content. The linear thermal expansion coefficient decreased as the urea content was increased. Measured values (100 to 156 x 10 - 6 °C) were comparable to those of the benchmark. The cooked urea-based moulding compound had the lowest melt viscosity at 110 °C, as indicated by its melt flow index (MFI). Fluidity increased with the polymer content. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results confirmed that both the PVOH and EVA urea-based moulding compounds decomposed readily and left less than 1 wt % ash after combustion. From the SEM results apparent surface roughness appeared to increase with wax content. The EVA urea-based moulding compound had an irregular surface texture. Based on the criteria of cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness, the synthesis of PVOH urea-based patterns is preferable. The use of a conventional extrusion process to prepare PVOH urea-based patterns is recommended. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E

Additionally, bacterial adhesion to a novel oxygen plasma modified PEEK was also investigated in both a pre-operative model in physiological saline, and additionally in a post-operative model in human blood plasma.

However, S. epidermidis adhesion to modified PEEK was less than to unmodified PEEK in the post-operative model. These results illustrate the importance of testing bacterial adhesion of several strains in both a pre-operative and post-operative, clinically relevant bacterial contamination model.
