Ouimet was employed by The Walt Disney Company for 17 years, including tenures as president of Disney Cruise Line and the Disneyland Resort.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Dick about his {{relationship}} with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, who says <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so she could get him in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to dig into the financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

The game resulted in a 17–14 defeat for Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Miller's combative {{reaction}} to post-speech media interviews received {{almost as much}} attention as the speech itself. First, in an interview with CNN, Miller had a dispute with Judy Woodruff, Wolf Blitzer, and Jeff Greenfield when they questioned him on his speech, particularly on whether he had misinterpreted the context and full content of Kerry's votes, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Cheney, as Defense Secretary, had opposed some of the same programs he attacked Kerry for voting against.|$|E

60|$|It must be {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>Dick's</b> heart thumped madly in his breast. The gun was raised {{and he kept}} {{his finger on the}} trigger. But he did not dare to shoot until he was certain of the object of his aim.|$|R
60|$|Things {{began to}} look serious {{and it must be}} confessed <b>that</b> <b>Dick's</b> heart beat fast, for he had no desire to undergo a {{switching}} at the hands of such a cold-hearted crowd, who would be sure to lay on the strokes heavily.|$|R
25|$|The {{sketches}} involving Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom {{tended to}} be either slapstick humour, puns or, more often than not, toilet humour. Eamonn Holmes was a guest inside the cupboard on two occasions, both times appearing as a head inside Diddy Dick and Dom's TV. According to the final episode, Diddy Dick and Dom left the cupboard to go to Hollywood. It {{was not until the}} final episode <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> and Dom discovered their Diddy counterparts, and reacted in exaggerated terror.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each show (starting July 8), Eric {{was asked}} to {{complete}} a task that America specified by voting on CBS.com or by text messaging. For every five tasks Eric completed, he was rewarded with $10,000 (USD). Viewers were able to vote on tasks from the end of an episode until midnight Pacific Time. The Thursday task involved pitching nominees to the Head of Household (HoH), the Sunday task was something interesting that might not affect the strategic game play, and the Tuesday task was swaying the opinion of the other HouseGuests on who to evict (unless it is he who is nominated). Once Eric received the task, he had to make a meaningful effort to complete the task. However, he could have decided how to complete the task. In addition, Eric cast his eviction vote for whom America chose to evict. Eric was a jury member on finale night, and the viewers voted <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> should receive Eric's vote to win the game.|$|E
500|$|Although {{economically}} {{speaking the}} film was a success and Disney {{was impressed by the}} opening weekend gross, studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg expressed disappointment. He suggested <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Tracy had cost about $100 million in total to produce, market and promote. [...] "We made demands on our time, talent and treasury that, upon reflection, may not have been worth it," [...] Katzenberg reported. Disney, in particular, was expecting the film's earnings to match Batman (1989). By 1997, Dick Tracy had made an additional $60.61 million in rental figures.|$|E

500|$|Turpin's {{father was}} a butcher and innkeeper. [...] Several stories suggest <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Turpin may have {{followed}} his father into these trades; one hints that, as a teenager, he was apprenticed to a butcher {{in the village of}} Whitechapel, while another proposes that he ran his own butcher's shop in Thaxted. [...] Testimony from his trial in 1739 suggests that he had a rudimentary education and, although no records survive of the date of the union, that in about 1725 he married Elizabeth Millington. [...] Following his apprenticeship they moved north to Buckhurst Hill, Essex, where Turpin opened a butcher's shop.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had {{compiled}} at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home. They included mixes {{of various}} songs, musical pieces and {{comments made by}} McCartney <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> James made into a demo for him. Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as [...] "electronic symphonies". He reversed the tapes, speeded them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "The Fool on the Hill".|$|E
500|$|On December 6, 2004, it was {{reported}} that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005 in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all. It was officially announced on December 14 <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, Clark said that he was thankful that Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job.

60|$|It must be confessed <b>that</b> <b>Dick's</b> {{heart beat}} loudly {{as he took}} his seat in the flying machine. It {{was one thing to}} talk about going up and quite another to really fly.

50|$|It {{was through}} {{his work on}} Doctor Who books <b>that</b> <b>Dicks</b> became a writer of children's fiction, penning many {{successful}} titles during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1976, he wrote a trilogy for Target Books, The Mounties, concerning a Royal Canadian Mounted Police recruit. They were followed from 1979 to 1983 another trilogy, Star Quest, which was later re-printed by Big Finish Productions.|$|R
500|$|During the 17th century, shallow mine {{workings}} {{began to develop}} {{in the area and}} in 1759 a turnpike was erected in the Catshill area. A local legend claims <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Turpin once vaulted the barricade on his horse to avoid paying the toll, although this is demonstrably false as Turpin was executed in 1739, twenty years before the turnpike's construction. In 1794 Brownhills (now in the plural) was included in a list of local settlements mentioned in an Act of Parliament concerning canals in Staffordshire, and three years later the Wyrley & Essington Canal, nicknamed the [...] "Curly Wyrley" [...] by the locals due to its winding course, was opened. In 1799 Norton Pool, later to be renamed Chasewater, was created to serve as a reservoir for the canals.|$|E
500|$|Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit {{inspired}} Lennon {{to write}} the lyrics for [...] "Imagine"—in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled [...] "Cloud Piece", reads: [...] "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in." [...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it—the lyric and the concept—came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit." [...] When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind [...] "Imagine".|$|E
500|$|Christopher Palmer, of La Trobe University, {{has written}} on the postmodern {{literary}} themes of Dick's early short stories, analyzing stories in which [...] "breakdown and ignorance" [...] {{are the result of}} social upheaval. Palmer proposed <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> often created post-apocalyptic scenarios of ruined worlds which held high tech gadgets in an attempt to present a view of postmodern materialism. Common to many of Dick's short stories were settings in which the outgrowth of modernity is a world where that which is natural is in ruin, and what is artificial is reshaped through science into a fantastically high tech form. [...] Palmer presented [...] "The Last of the Masters" [...] as an example of this, as well as [...] "The Variable Man" [...] and The Penultimate Truth, two other post-apocalyptic works by Dick. Palmer contended that these shared themes were [...] "...not simply the expression of dystopian malaise, or of Luddism treacherously taking up residence in popular SF... It points to a coherent interpretation of industrialism and post-industrialism." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} select {{examples from}} Philip K. Dick's fictional oeuvre {{while attempting to}} build a bridge to and between three views on {{the location of the}} faculty of memory and two views on the posthuman relation between the mind and the body. By engaging with rather essentialist views on the location of memory (Draaisma, Baddeley, Schacter and others), views that free up memory by locating it in the media (Landsberg) and perspectives that increasingly disembody the mind from the human skin bag (Lyotard, Clark and Hayles), this thesis argues <b>that</b> <b>Dick's</b> fictions contain and contribute to various (interconnected) strands of science and philosophy. Analysis will show <b>that</b> <b>Dick's</b> novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) incorporates views on the purity of memory and the artificiality of the body to sustain a larger narrative on existentialism and humanity. Throughout this thesis, Dick's imagination and conceptualisation will be treated as prophetic forces that have the power to render abstract ideas concrete and imaginable...|$|R
60|$|At eleven, {{unless there}} were {{unexpected}} telegrams or business, she could usually count on finding Dick {{alone for a}} space, although invariably busy. Passing the secretaries' room, {{the click of a}} typewriter informed her that one obstacle was removed.

500|$|Other {{causes for}} the {{incident}} were later suggested. Before committing the act, Brynn {{was taking the}} antidepressant drug Zoloft. A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Brynn's brother, Gregory Omdahl, against Pfizer, the drug's manufacturer, and her child's psychiatrist Arthur Sorosky, who provided samples of Zoloft to Brynn. Hartman's friend and former SNL colleague Jon Lovitz has accused Hartman's former NewsRadio co-star Andy Dick of re-introducing Brynn to cocaine, causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown. Dick claims to have known nothing of her condition. In 2006, Lovitz claimed <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> had approached him at a restaurant and said, [...] "I put the Phil Hartman hex on you; you're the next one to die." [...] Lovitz responded by smashing Dick's face into the bar. [...] The following year at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles, Lovitz and Dick had a further altercation over the issue. Dick asserts {{that he is not}} at fault in relation to Hartman's death.|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> Clark {{would return}} to New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I knew when I was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|Continuing his analysis, Barlow {{addressed}} [...] "The Last of the Masters", contrasting it with {{an earlier}} work by Dick, [...] "The Defenders". In [...] "The Defenders", humanity has been duped by a noble lie—provided by their robot soldiers—into believing in a war which is not actually taking place. In the latter story, Barlow asserts <b>that</b> <b>Dick</b> surprisingly agreed with such neoconservative theorists as Leo Strauss in {{the efficacy of the}} deception. [...] "Here, the [...] have saved mankind... The 'noble lie' has served its purpose." [...] However, Barlow concedes, [...] "ut this is an extremely early story and Dick had not yet clarified his own world view..." [...] Comparing this story to [...] "The Last of the Masters", Barlow took note of Dick's commentary from The Golden Man collection ("...sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical.") and concluded that the story represented Dick's understanding of [...] "the problems at the other extreme..." [...] in politics. Where most of Dick's stories presented government in skeptical terms to warn the reader of potential abuse, [...] "The Last of the Master" [...] presented an argument for the utility of government.|$|E
