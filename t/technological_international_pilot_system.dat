40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRemote <b>Piloted</b> Aircraft <b>Systems</b> (RPAS) are {{operating}} in highly critical contexts {{and carry out}} a wide collection of complex mission tasks {{through the use of}} sensors. In this paper, we present a new agent-based architecture that handles sensors of these platforms. Today, the requirements of the platform in terms of autonomy, modularity, ro-bustness and reactivity as well as the industrial constraints call for the design of a new multifunction system architecture. Such a design may rely on multi-agent paradigm since it is modular by design and the agents naturally bring autonomy and pro-activity to the system. This paper presents new and original contributions: (1) an original agentification of the system {{in the form of a}} multi-agent architecture that helps to capture the dynamic of the environment; (2) agents that generates plans of tasks according to the resources (e. g. the sensors) he needs; (3) a scheduler that handles the plans of tasks issued by the agents in order to provide an efficient scheduling of sensors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{extensive}} West Nile virus surveillance {{program of}} dead birds, mosquitoes, horses, and human infection has been launched {{as a result}} of West Nile virus first being reported in Canada in 2001. Some desktop and web GIS have been applied to West Nile virus dead bird surveillance. There have been urgent needs for a comprehensive GIS services and real-time surveillance. Results A <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> was developed to integrate real-time surveillance, real-time GIS, and Open GIS technology in order to enhance West Nile virus dead bird surveillance in Canada. Driven and linked by the newly developed real-time web GIS technology, this integrated real-time surveillance system includes conventional real-time web-based surveillance components, integrated real-time GIS components, and integrated Open GIS components. The <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> identified the major GIS functions and capacities that may be important to public health surveillance. The six web GIS clients provide a wide range of GIS tools for public health surveillance. The <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> has been serving Canadian national West Nile virus dead bird surveillance since 2005 and is adaptable to serve other disease surveillance. Conclusion This <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> has streamlined, enriched and enhanced national West Nile virus dead bird surveillance in Canada, improved productivity, and reduced operation cost. Its real-time GIS technology, static map technology, WMS integration, and its integration with non-GIS real-time surveillance <b>system</b> made this <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> unique in surveillance and public health GIS. </p...|$|R

The purpose of the trip was to promote his father's farm equipment products. While in Berlin, Ole Fahlin visited the Johannisthal Air Field where he took flying lessons from Hans Riesler, an old army pilot. When he returned home Fahlin eventually flew for the Swedish Royal Air Service as a pilot. On 21 April 1921, he obtained his <b>international</b> <b>pilot's</b> license from Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications have workloads {{comprised of}} multiple heterogeneous {{tasks that are}} not known in advance and may vary in the resources needed during execution. However, high-performance computing systems are designed to support applications comprised of mostly monolithic, single-job workloads. <b>Pilot</b> <b>systems</b> decouple workload specification, resource selection, and task execution via job placeholders and late-binding. <b>Pilot</b> <b>systems</b> help to satisfy the resource requirements of workloads comprised of multiple tasks with the capabilities and usage policies of HPC systems.

40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} European Detect and Avoid project MIDCAS three {{human-in-the-loop}} simulation campaigns {{were conducted}} with remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> equipped with a Detect and Avoid system flying according to instrument flight rules in an air traffic control environment. Situation awareness for remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilots</b> and air traffic controllers was studied {{as part of an}} evaluation of the operational concept. Experienced pilots and air traffic controllers participated. Data was collected for qualitative analysis including observer logs, questionnaires, and notes from debriefings/workshops. In general the situation awareness was good however there were also examples of lost situation awareness during the simulations, reported in this paper. Lessons learned include how the system could further support remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilots</b> situation awareness by highlighting if intruder is transponder equipped or not and semi-static or frozen information regarding traffic avoidance and standardized phraseology should be used to further support shared situation awareness between remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilot</b> and air traffic controller.
