5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a <b>threshing</b> <b>floor.</b> If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E

5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for <b>threshing</b> <b>floors.</b> The longer the barn was, the more <b>threshing</b> <b>floors</b> could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} threshing floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three <b>threshing</b> <b>floors,</b> allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time.|$|R

25|$|The {{north and}} west ranges were built in 1782-4 by John Reid. The north range stands on the {{foundations}} of an earlier building, probably a 17th-century longhouse. The small byre was re-roofed and upgraded in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The corn barn still has its <b>threshing</b> <b>floor</b> where a flail would {{have been used by}} hand until a horse-engine and threshing machine was installed in around 1820 to 1840. This was in turn replaced in 1860 by the present threshing mill. Finally around 1870 travelling mills made even this mill redundant.|$|E
25|$|The barn {{was given}} to the diocese by the Lambert family, with major {{contributions}} from their Hoare relations, one of whom– Walter Hoare of Basingstoke– supplied specially baked tiles and two-inch bricks of 17th-century style to match the timbers. The bricks are of the two-inch type which were used at the time the barn was built. The slate slabs in the porches are the original <b>threshing</b> <b>floor</b> of the barn. The mullioned windows are copied from Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire. The tower-frame, copied from Tandridge Church near Oxted, was made from timber cut at South Park, Bletchingley. The bell was given by Holy Trinity, Wandsworth. The broach spire was copied from St Swithun's Church, Martyr Worthy near Winchester.|$|E
25|$|Originally the Low German house {{took its}} {{simplest}} and basic form, the Zweiständerhaus or two-post farmhouse. This had {{two rows of}} uprights on which the ceiling joists rested. The two rows of posts {{ran the length of}} the building and created the great central <b>threshing</b> <b>floor</b> or Diele characteristic of this type of farmhouse. On the outside of the rows of uprights, underneath the eaves, low side rooms or bays known as Kübbungen were often built with non load-bearing external walls. These Kübbungen acted as stables or stalls for the cattle and gave this type of house its alternative name of Kübbungshaus. A classic feature of the Zweiständerhaus is that the loft is not supported by the outside walls but only by the two rows of uprights that form part of the hall sides or walls.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of ethnographic observations of non-mechanized crop-processing activities at two localities in Catalonia (Spain). The aim of the study is to analyze the patterns of phytolith deposition on <b>threshing</b> <b>floors</b> {{and to be able to}} reconstruct them. Phytoliths are extremely durable plant micro-remains that are commonly found in archaeological sediments and can provide information on the types and parts of plants used in the past. The preliminary results of phytolith analysis and geostatistic applications to the identification of spatial patterns of deposition are presented. The application of geostatistic techniques allows for the identification of general spatial patterns derived from the circularity of movement with which the crop processing took place. The combination of phytolith analysis and geostatistics could help to identify archaeological <b>threshing</b> <b>floors,</b> thus providing information on early crop-processing practices and the adoption of agriculture.

2500|$|The {{following}} custom {{was recorded}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica. Early in the morning of Little Christmas, children of the family spread Christmas straw from their house around the stake in the center of their village's <b>threshing</b> <b>floor.</b> The use of this stake was to tether a horse to it; the animal was then driven around to thresh grain by treading with its hooves. The woman of the house baked a big round unleavened loaf of bread with a hole in its center, inscribed with circles, crosses, hooks, and other symbols on its surface. The loaf was taken to the <b>threshing</b> <b>floor,</b> and fixed round the stake. The oldest man of the family would take hold of the stake with his right hand above the loaf. With his left hand he held the right hand of the next oldest man, and so on to the youngest boy who could walk steadily. Holding hands in this manner, they would run around the stake three times. During the running they would shout in unison as loud as possible, [...] "Ajd ajde, koba moja!" [...] meaning [...] "Giddy-up, my mare!" [...] – except for the man holding the stake, who would shout, [...] "De! De! De!" [...] meaning [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] They would then take the hollow loaf back home, and put it near the fireplace beside the remnant of badnjak. The woman of the house would [...] "feed them fodder", i.e., prepare a meal for them, consisting of đevenica (a sort of dried sausage), roast pork, and the hollow loaf, plus rakia for the adults. Having eaten, they would go back to the <b>threshing</b> <b>floor</b> and repeat the whole ritual, only this time without the loaf. In the end, they would collect Christmas straw from the threshing floor; it was put in hens' nests to prevent them from laying eggs outside the nests. This custom was considered as especially joyful for children.|$|E

2500|$|The {{floor plan}} of aisled barns {{resembles that of}} an aisled church. However, the nave in farm {{buildings}} is called an aisle thus a [...] "three aisled barn".

The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{yields of}} Borlaug's crops {{were higher than}} any ever {{harvested}} in South Asia. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000tons—the largest purchase and import of any seed {{in the world at}} that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000tons, and Turkey 21,000tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100km²), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year. By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug's work a [...] "Green Revolution". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities—labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the <b>threshing</b> <b>floor,</b> jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.|$|E
2500|$|Usually stone built, British bank barns are {{rectangular}} buildings. They {{usually have}} a central threshing area with hay or corn (cereal) storage bays on either side on the upper floor; and byres, stables, cartshed or other rooms below. The threshing barn on the upper floor was entered by double doors in the long wall approached from a raised bank: these banks could be artificially created. [...] Opposite the main doors was a small winnowing door which opened high above the farmyard level. A common arrangement had an open-fronted single bay cartshed below the <b>threshing</b> <b>floor,</b> with stables {{on one side and}} a cow-house on the other.

25|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, grain was threshed {{to remove it}} from the stalks by beating it with sticks or by oxen {{treading}} on it. This usually broke most of the grain kernels, which limited their storage time because broken kernels spoil more quickly than unbroken ones. The development of the threshing-board, which was pulled over the stalks by oxen, left most of the grain kernels intact and enhanced their storage time. Numerous <b>threshing</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>threshing</b> boards have been discovered at archaeological sites of ancient Israel.|$|R

2500|$|Jewish {{connection}} and veneration {{to the site}} arguably {{stems from the fact}} that it contains the Foundation Stone which, according to the rabbis of the Talmud, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form. It was subsequently the Holy of Holies of the Temple, the Most Holy Place in Judaism. Jewish tradition names it as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, Jacob's dream, and the prayer of Isaac and Rebekah. Similarly, when the Bible recounts that King David purchased a <b>threshing</b> <b>floor</b> owned by Araunah the Jebusite, tradition locates it as being on this mount. An early Jewish text, the Genesis Rabba, states that this site is one of three about which the nations of the world cannot taunt Israel and say [...] "you have stolen them," [...] since it was purchased [...] "for its full price" [...] by David. According to the Bible, David wanted to construct a sanctuary there, but this was left to his son Solomon, who completed the task in c. 950 BCE with the construction of the First Temple.|$|E
