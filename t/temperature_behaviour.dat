40|$|The {{increasing}} {{growth of}} traffic volume and loading makes {{it necessary to}} introduce new types of asphalt with improved performances. High modulus asphalt mixtures {{have been developed for}} this purpose. These are mixtures with a high stiffness bitumen and a high binder content. A possible drawback of these hypes of mixtures is the low <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> which might be less good as for traditional asphalt mixtures. In this paper we will focus on the low <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> of high modulus bituminous binders and asphalt mixtures. The low temperature performance of the bitumen is investigated with the bending beam rheometer (BBR). The low <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the high modulus asphalt mixture is investigated with the restrained cooling test (RCT).

30|$|This {{study focused}} on the heat {{transfer}} involved in hot pressing. The <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> inside the mat of wood-based panels according to the manufacturing conditions—such as mat moisture level, furnish material, and press temperature—was characterised. Hinoki strands and ring-flaker recycled wood particles were used for experimental panel production. <b>Temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> was measured at the surface and {{the centre of the}} mat. The results indicate that the manufacturing condition affected the <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the mat during hot pressing. Plateau time increased with increasing mat moisture content and utilisation of hinoki strands but decreased with increasing press temperature. Use of hinoki strands resulted in a higher plateau temperature than did recycled wood particles. The higher mat moisture content and press temperature resulted in a higher plateau temperature. Furnish type also affected heat conductivity in the mat centre after the completion of the plateau.|$|E
40|$|We perform angle-resolved photoemission {{spectroscopy}} on 1 T -TaS 2 and 1 T -TaSe 2 using synchrotron radiation. We {{observe a}} characteristic splitting of the chalcogen p-derived valence bands along high symmetry directions. Density functional theory calculation and group theory {{strongly suggest that}} this splitting is due to spin–orbit interaction along one direction, and to symmetry along the other direction. We note that, according to the Kramers degeneracy, the spin–orbit interaction leaves every state doubly degenerate. Furthermore, this study allows us to identify a mixing between bands with Ta 5 d and Se 4 p character, possibly relevant for the different <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the two compounds...|$|R

In the MHz range the attenuation and the sound velocity are mainly governed by (i) quantum-mechanical tunnelling below 20 K, (ii) thermally activated relaxations between 20 and 200 K and (iii) vibrational anharmonicity at even higher temperatures. In the GHz range and in the temperature interval between 77 and 300 K, additional contributions besides the relaxation process must be taken into consideration to account for the hypersonic attenuation...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the {{substrate}} on the effective surface impedance of a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta thin film grown over a silicon substrate. The microwave measurements, performed with a resonant cavity technique at two distinct frequencies (24 and 48 GHz), show anomalies both in the temperature and in the frequency dependences. By properly taking into account a relevant complex substrate contribution, with an important role played by the finite thickness effect, the whole set of data finds a satisfactory explanation in terms of standard impedance transformations. Using independent measurements at a single temperature, it is possible to extract the temperature dependence of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta bulk surface impedance, which shows the expected frequency and <b>temperature</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
