40|$|The use of CuCl(PPh 3) {{in place}} of CuCl in the Gattermann-Koch {{synthesis}} slightly improves the yield of PhCHO but lowers the yield of <b>tolualdehyde.</b> The poorest yields are obtained {{in the presence of}} CuCl(PPh 3) 3. The formation of <b>tolualdehyde</b> from toluene and CO in the presence of AlCl 3 and HCl is faster in the presence of CuCl, but higher yields are obtained in its absence and using an excess of hydrocarbon. In competitive expts. carried out using benzene and toluene together in equimol. amts., only <b>tolualdehyde</b> was formed, supporting the view that an electrophilic substitution is involved...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas Pxy was {{isolated}} on p-xylene as sole source of carbon and energy. Substrates that supported growth were toluene, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-tolualdehyde, p-toluic acid, and the analogous m-methyl derivatives, including m-xylene. Cell extracts prepared from Pseudomonas Pxy after growth with either p-xylene or m-xylene oxidized the p- and m-isomers of <b>tolualdehyde</b> {{as well as}} p-methylbenzyl alcohol. The same cell extracts also catalyzed a “meta” fission of both 3 - and 4 -methylcatechol. Treatment of Pseudomonas Pxy with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine led to the isolation of two mutant strains. Pseudomonas Pxy- 40, when grown on succinate {{in the presence of}} p-xylene, accumulated p-toluic acid in the culture medium. Under the same conditions Pseudomonas Pxy- 82 accumulated p-toluic acid and also 4 -methylcatechol. When Pseudomonas Pxy- 82 was grown on succinate in the presence of m-xylene, 3 -methylcatechol and 3 -methylsalicylic acid were excreted into the culture medium. A pathway is proposed for the initial reactions utilized by Pseudomonas Pxy to oxidize p- and m-xylene...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the carbonyls emissions from a turbocharged, direct injection, and intercooled compression ignition engine, an experimental study was conducted using diesel, biodiesel, and 20 % biodiesel-diesel blend as test fuels. Fourteen carbonyls were identified and quantified from the engine exhaust at four different engine conditions. Experimental results show that formaldehyde and total carbonyls from the test fuels exhibit maximum BSE at low load, which decreases {{with the increase in}} load. Carbonyls such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein + acetone, propionaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and methyl ethyl ketone show higher, but aromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and <b>tolualdehyde)</b> reflect lower BSE from B 20 and B 100 as compared to diesel fuel. Total carbonyls emissions from B 20 and B 100 are 8 % and 32 % higher respectively than those from diesel fuel. Formaldehyde is the most abundant carbonyl of the test fuels with 56. 5 %, 53. 9 %, and 52. 7 % contribution to total carbonyls in case of diesel, B 20, and B 100 respectively. Specific reactivity of carbonyls from the test fuels follow the order as B 20 < D < B 100...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of trans-cinnamic acid in a mixed aqueous solution of acetic acid and methanol containing potassium hydroxide was studied. The separation of ketones and aldehydes from the neutral materials using Girard reagent P gave benzaldehyde, <b>tolualdehydes,</b> acetophenone, methylacetophenones, propiophenone, phenacyl acetate, and phenacyl alcohol. The {{mechanism of the}} anodic reaction of trans-cinnamic acid has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} mild (room temperature) process for {{oxidation}} of o-, m- or p-xylene to the corresponding methylbenzyl alcohols, <b>tolualdehydes</b> and toluic acids, using H 2 O 2 (30 % aqueous solution) and the iron(II) C-scorpionate [FeCl 2 {κ 3 -HC(pz) 3 }] (pz = pyrazol- 1 -yl) catalyst is presented. Remarkably, after 5 min of reaction an overall oxygenates yield of 22 % (TOF = 1. 3 × 102 h− 1) was obtained. The effects of reaction parameters, such as reaction time, temperature, amount of catalyst, type {{and amount of}} oxidant are reported and discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Remarkably, a p-toluic acid yield of 43 % (73 % selectivity, TON = 1. 34 V 10 (3)) was obtained with 2 @CNT in a simple microwave-assisted mild oxidation procedure, using a very low catalyst charge (3. 2 x 10 (- 2) mol% vs. substrate). Further, this occurred {{in the absence of}} any bromine source, what is significant towards the development of a greener and more sustainable process for oxidation of xylenes. Moreover, reuse of catalysts with preservation of their activity was found for up to six consecutive cycles. The effects of reaction parameters, such as reaction time, temperature, amount of catalyst or type of heating source, on the performance of the above catalytic systems are reported and discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Topology {{is an area}} of {{mathematics}} concerned with spatial properties that are preserved under deformation. When applied to chemistry it allows stretching of bonds and bending of structure, but no breaking. A topologically planar molecule is one that has been deformed to become planar; however, there cannot be any crossing over between bonds. A porphyrin molecule is a macrocyclic organic molecule that consists of four pyrroles attached to each other by methine bridges. In order to have a topologically non-planar porphyrin, two straps must be introduced in order to bridge the molecule. Addition of a metal {{to the center of the}} molecule results in a topologically non-planar porphyrin. The synthetic route to the base porphyrin started with α-bromo-ο-tolunitrile and sodium methoxide to produce α-methoxy-ο tolunitrile. The tolunitrile was reduced with dibal and hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid/water to form α-methoxy-ο-tolualdehyde. Subsequently, the <b>tolualdehyde</b> was combined with pyrrole to form a ?half porphyrin,? called a dipyrromethane. The final step in the synthesis of the base porphyrin combined the dipyrromethane and α-bromo-ο-tolualdehyde, with boron trifluoride catalyst. Different atropisomers were characterized by ?H NMR as the methoxy groups exhibited varying chemical shifts and peaks. Heating the porphyrin to 70 ?C appeared to rotate the methoxy groups, overcoming the problem of having multiple atropisomers. Various attempts at introducing straps to the base porphyrin have been inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the comparison of}} unregulated emissions such as carbonyls and BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl Benzene, and Xylenes) species emanated from a light duty SI (Spark Ignition) vehicle E- 0 (fuelled on gasoline) and E- 10 (ethanol-gasoline blend). Meanwhile, the ozone forming potential of these pollutants based on their ozone SR (Specific Reactivity) has also been addressed in this study. The experiments were performed on transient as well as steady-state modes {{in accordance with the}} standard protocols recommended for light duty vehicle emissions. Carbonyls and BTEX were analyzed by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) with UV detector and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy), respectively. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the predominant components of the carbonyls for E- 0 and E- 10, respectively. During transient mode, formaldehyde, acrolein + acetone, and <b>tolualdehyde</b> pollutants were decreased but, acetaldehyde emissions increased with E- 10 as compared to E- 0. The BTEX emissions were also decreased with E- 10, relative to E- 0. During the steady-state modes, formaldehyde, acrolein + acetone and propionaldehyde were lower, aromatic aldehydes were absent, but acetaldehyde pollutants were higher with E- 10 compared to E- 0. The BTEX emissions were decreased at medium and higher speed modes however, increased at lower speed mode with E- 10 as compared to E- 0. Total BTEX emissions were maximal at lower speed mode but, least at medium speed mode for both the fuels. SR of the pollutants was higher over transient cycle of operation, compared with steady-state mode. Relative to E- 0, E- 10 displayed lower SR during both transient as well as steady-state mode...|$|E
40|$|Cooking fumes are an {{important}} carbonyl emission source, especially in a highly urbanized city, such as Hong Kong. Cooking exhaust from 15 commercial kitchens {{of a variety of}} cooking styles was sampled and analyzed for a suite of 13 carbonyl compounds. Carbonyl compositions were varied among the different cooking styles. Formaldehyde was generally the most abundant carbonyl, and its contribution to the total carbonyl amount on a molar basis ranged from 12 to 60 %. Acrolein was also found to be an abundant carbonyl in the cooking exhaust. The highest contribution by acrolein to the total carbonyls was found to be 30 % in the exhaust of a western-style steak restaurant. Long-chain saturated carbonyls, that is, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal, accounted for a significant fraction (> 40 %) of the total carbonyls in kitchens that always used heated cooking oils. Two dicarbonyls, glyoxal and methylglyoxal, had a various presence in the cooking emissions, ranging from negligible to 10 %. The presence of benzaldehyde and <b>tolualdehyde</b> was mostly negligible in the sampled kitchen exhaust. Annual emission rates of both individual carbonyls and total carbonyls were estimated for various types of commercial kitchens. Local-style fast-food shops contributed the highest total carbonyl emissions per year mainly because of the large number of this kind of restaurant in Hong Kong. The citywide annual emission rates of the three most toxic carbonyls, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, were estimated assuming that the limited number of sampled restaurants were representative of the average restaurants. Such estimates of carbonyl emission rates were comparable to the estimated carbonyl emissions from vehicular sources, suggesting the importance of commercial cooking as a source for carbonyls in Hong Kong...|$|E
