40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the regional incidence of the effects of public investment in <b>transportation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in Portugal. Our methodological approach consists of estimating vector autoregressive (VAR) models for the national economy as well as for each of the five administrative regions in the country. In the regional models, both public investment in <b>transportation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the region and public investment in <b>transportation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> elsewhere are considered, thereby taking into consideration the potential existence of regional spillovers. Empirical results suggest that although public investment in <b>transportation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> has been a powerful instrument to promote long-term growth, it does so in a way that is rather unbalanced across regions. We show that public investment in <b>transportation</b> <b>infrastructures</b> has markedly contributed to the concentration of economic activity in Lisbon, the largest region in the country, and therefore has contributed markedly to the macrocephaly of the countr...|$|R

The assessment made it possible to identify six unstable runways and two unstable access roads. However, three airports in Nunavik need to be monitor very closely: Kangirsuk, Salluit and Tasiujaq. Three mitigation methods are proposed to reduce permafrost degradation at Nunavik transportation infrastructures: heat drain, air convective embankment and reflective surface...|$|R

The proposed method takes into account the facility failure induced crowd redistribution and explores the structure importance of the evacuation network component. The method of bottleneck identification is also applicable to other similar transportation networks...|$|R
