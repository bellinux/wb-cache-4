30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{imbibition}} capacity {{and the influence of}} the mineral composition and physical properties of <b>tight</b> <b>rocks.</b> Samples include gas shales from the Sichuan Basin, tight sandstones from the Ordos Basin, and <b>tight</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> from the Songliao Basin. Experiments can be divided into three groups. In group 1, the imbibition capacity and rate of deionized water uptake are investigated systematically. In group 2, each sample is immersed repeatedly in deionized water several times to address the water sensitivity of different rocks. In group 3, comparative experiments are conducted to explore the effects of different fluids on the imbibition capacity.|$|R
30|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} of water-based fracturing fluids {{into the}} shale matrix {{is considered to}} be the main mechanism responsible for the high volume of water loss during the flowback period. Understanding the matrix imbibition capacity and rate helps to determine the fracturing fluid volume, optimize the flowback design, and to analyze the influences on the production of shale gas. Imbibition experiments were conducted on shale samples from the Sichuan Basin, and some tight sandstone samples from the Ordos Basin. Tight volcanic samples from the Songliao Basin were also investigated for comparison. The effects of porosity, clay minerals, surfactants, and KCl solutions on the matrix imbibition capacity and rate were systematically investigated. The results show that the imbibition characteristic of <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> can be characterized by the imbibition curve shape, the imbibition capacity, the imbibition rate, and the diffusion rate. The driving forces of water imbibition are the capillary pressure and the clay absorption force. For the <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> with low clay contents, the imbibition capacity and rate are positively correlated with the porosity. For <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> with high clay content, the type and content of clay minerals are the most important factors affecting the imbibition capacity. The imbibed water volume normalized by the porosity increases with an increasing total clay content. Smectite and illite/smectite tend to greatly enhance the water imbibition capacity. Furthermore, clay-rich <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> can imbibe a volume of water greater than their measured pore volume. The average ratio of the imbibed water volume to the pore volume is approximately 1.1 in the Niutitang shale, 1.9 in the Lujiaping shale, 2.8 in the Longmaxi shale, and 4.0 in the Yingcheng volcanic rock, and this ratio can be regarded as a parameter that indicates the influence of clay. In addition, surfactants can change the imbibition capacity due to alteration of the capillary pressure and wettability. A 10 wt% KCl solution can inhibit clay absorption to reduce the imbibition capacity.|$|R

5000|$|Shear has {{recorded}} more than 20 albums to date. He {{made his first}} appearance on vinyl with Funky Kings (along with two other songwriters, Jack Tempchin and Richard Stekol). After their second album {{was rejected by the}} record label, he formed a new band, the critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) pop group, Jules and the Polar Bears. This band, with Shear writing and singing all songs, would release two albums (Got No Breeding and f…ôÀànetÃ¨¬∑…™ks), merging a <b>tight</b> <b>rock</b> sound with the emerging synth-pop of the early 1980s. Their third album was rejected by their record label but released as Bad For Business in 1996, long after the band had broken up. With Jules and the Polar Bears finished, Shear bounced back with several solo albums. The first, Watch Dog, was produced by Todd Rundgren, and featured such players as Tony Levin on bass and Elliot Easton of The Cars on lead guitar. During the sessions, Shear and Easton struck up a friendship, based on their shared musical tastes, which would lead to various collaborations later on. The album featured the original version of [...] "All Through the Night", which Cyndi Lauper would eventually turn into a top-five hit. The albums opening number, [...] "Whispering Your Name", would reach #18 in the UK Singles Chart when Alison Moyet recorded her version of it; Moyet also performed the song on Top of the Pops. Shear then released an EP, Jules, which contained selections from Watch Dog on one side, and two mixes of a club-style dance number, [...] "When Love Surges", on the other side. Shears next full-length album, The Eternal Return, was a highly polished, synthesizer-heavy effort, produced by Bill Drescher (of Rick Springfield fame). The album opened with [...] "If She Knew What She Wants", which The Bangles would make into a hit. It also featured what would prove to be Shears only hit single under his own name, [...] "Steady" [...] which he wrote in collaboration with Cyndi Lauper. The single reached #48 in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the worlds}} {{currently}} accessible hydrocarbon resources are found in <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> - rocks with permeabilities in the millidarcy range and with pore sizes in the nanometer range. <b>Tight</b> <b>rocks</b> pose new scientific problems {{because of the small}} length-scales involved. Traditional oil plays are found in, for example, sand stone reservoirs with millimeter to micrometer sized pores. For such systems, standard hydrodynamics is a sufficient tool to understand, describe and predict fluid transport. In <b>tight</b> <b>rocks,</b> however, typical pore sizes are in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers. At this scale, the mean free path - the average distance a particle moves between collisions - may become comparable to the characteristic sizes of the porous medium, and the standard assumption that the fluid can be described as a continuum no longer holds. The mean free path of dilute gases are often tens of nanometers, or higher. The gas from <b>tight</b> <b>rocks,</b> like shales, is stored inside closed pore networks or adsorbed onto organic matter. In order to extract adequate levels of gas from such rocks, we generate fractures to increase the permeability of the rock. The gas flows from small pore networks with diameters down to a few nanometers. The rate at which the gas flows through such networks is proportional to the permeability of the material - a result known as Darcy's law. Dilute gases in nanoporous media have a non-zero slip velocity which can cause an increase of permeability of a factor 50 compared to what continuum theory predicts. This is an effect known as the Klinkenberg effect. In {{order to be able to}} increase gas production rates in a safe way, we need to understand the physics at this scale. This requires models that are valid at these length scales. In this thesis, we implement two numerical particle models. The first is called Molecular Dynamics. It describes the motion of atoms by using parameterized potentials to compute forces between them. The second model, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, uses the principles of statistical mechanics allowing larger systems to be studied. Both implementations support arbitrary geometries, and show promising scaling efficiency on massive parallel machines. We use these models to study the Klinkenberg effect and confirm that the Knudsen permeability correction correctly predicts the permeability for systems with pore sizes down to a few nanometers. We also analyze more complicated geometries, and argue that a stochastic version of the Knudsen correction is needed for geometries without a well defined Knudsen number. Highly efficient custom 3 D visualization tools are developed using modern OpenGL techniques such as instanced geometry shaders, billboards and the marching cubes algorithm. Systems with tens of millions of particles can be rendered realtime with decent frame rate, allowing us to study larger systems than what can be done with already existing free software. All software developed during this thesis can serve as tools for further study in the field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Experiments were {{performed}} {{by using an}} improved test system of physical parameters of rock materials. Influence of effective stress, temperature and flow velocity of fluid on permeability or porosity of <b>tight</b> <b>rock</b> materials under high temperature and high pressure was investigated. A micro-mechanism was given to interpret changes of the permeability or the porosity {{by means of a}} microscopic imaging method. Results show that the permeability decreases with an increase in effective stress or temperature and increases with an increase in flow velocity of fluid, and that relative change of the porosity increases with an increase of effective stress and is not detectable with an increase in temperature. The main reasons for the above changes are nonlinear flow and narrowing of micro-cracks under action of effective stress or thermal effects. Changes of the micro-cracks play a more important role in the permeability than in the porosity.

50|$|The {{presence}} of hydrocarbons (e.g. oil, natural gas, condensate) {{will reduce the}} response on an SP log because the interstitial water contact with the well bore fluid is reduced. This phenomenon is called hydrocarbon suppression {{and can be used}} to diagnose rocks for commercial potential. The SP curve is usually 'flat' opposite shale formations because there is no ion exchange due to the low permeability, low porosity properties (tight)thus creating a baseline. <b>Tight</b> <b>rocks</b> other than shale (e.g. tight sandstones, tight carbonates) will also result in poor or no response on the SP curve because of no ion exchange.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the imbibed volume exceeds the pore volume in rocks, so the water presumably entered into a space where the gas used to measure the {{porosity}} could not enter. Another explanation is that absorption of water by the clay can induce cracks and increase the pore volume. The high water imbibition capacity in <b>tight</b> <b>rocks</b> may be related to clay minerals. This is consistent with the well-known phenomenon of wellbore instability in well drilling. The experiments in group 2 were conducted to explore the effects of clay minerals on the imbibition process. A single sample was tested several times repeatedly.|$|R
