60|$|October 9.--A gracious {{letter from}} Messrs. Abud and Son, bill-brokers, etc.; assure Mr. Gibson {{that they will}} {{institute}} no legal proceedings against me {{for four or five}} weeks.

60|$|Since I last {{wrote to}} you I have left that hotel, {{and come to}} live in a French family. It's a kind of boarding-house {{combined}} with a kind of school; only it's not like an American hoarding-house, nor like an American school either. There are four or five people here that have come to learn the language--not to take lessons, but to have an opportunity for conversation. I was very glad to come to such a place, for I had begun to realise that I was not making much progress with the French. It seemed to me that I should feel ashamed to have spent two months in Paris, and not to have acquired more insight into the language. I had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I was having no more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at Bangor. In fact, I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor, from those French Canadians that came down to cut the ice, than I saw I should ever hear at that hotel. The lady that kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose), that I couldn't bear to let her know I didn't like it. The chambermaid was Irish, and all the waiters were German, so that I never heard a word of French spoken. I suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops; only, as I don't buy anything--I prefer <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> for purposes of culture--I don't have that advantage.|$|E
60|$|Since I last {{wrote to}} you I’ve left that nice hotel {{and come to}} live in a French family—which, however, is nice too. This place is a kind of boarding-house that’s {{at the same time a}} kind of school; only it’s not like an American boarding-house, nor like an American school either. There are four or five people here that have come to learn the language—not to take lessons, but to have an {{opportunity}} for conversation. I was very glad to come to such a place, for I had begun to realise that I wasn’t pressing onward quite as I had dreamed with the French. Wasn’t I going to feel ashamed to have spent two months in Paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language? I had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I wasn’t having much more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at Bangor. In fact I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor from those French-Canadians who came down to cut the ice than I saw I should ever hear at that nice hotel where was no struggle—some fond struggle being my real atmosphere. The lady who kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose)—she kind of yearned to struggle too: we don’t yearn only down in Maine—that I couldn’t bear to show her I didn’t like it.

60|$|When {{we had had}} {{coffee and}} were going out, I found our own {{conductor}} in a little chair by the fire. He was looking a bit pathetic.

But it was not till afterwards, putting things together, that I realized he had wanted to be with us all at table, but that his conductor's wages probably did not allow him <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the <b>money.</b> <b>My</b> bill for the dinner was about fifteen francs, for the two of us.|$|R

I don't want anybody <b>to</b> help me <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money.</b> I made it, and I can manage it. I guess Mr. Fulkerson can bear a little watching now.

5000|$|According to the {{published}} score, the instrumentation is: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets in C, 2 cornets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, harp, violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, contrabasses.The First Rhapsody is ebullient and outgoing. It begins by quoting the folk song [...] "Am un leu şi vreau să-l beau" [...] (variously translated as [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> <b>money</b> on drink", [...] "I have a coin, and I want a drink", [...] "I {{want to spend}} my shilling on drink", or, more literally, [...] "I have a leu and I want to drink it"), which is played by oboes and clarinets. The tune was played by the Romani violinist Lae Chioru (Nicolae Filip), from whom Enescu had his first violin lessons {{at the age of}} 4, but there is some doubt whether Enescu actually remembered it from Chioru, since the tune had been in circulation in various collections printed as early as 1848 (alternative spelling: [...] "Am un leu şi vreau să-l beu"), which Enescu could have consulted. [...] This is soon replaced with a slower melody first introduced in the violins. As the work progresses, this tune grows faster and livelier to climax in a vibrant whirling folk dance.|$|E
60|$|Well, I can wait. Anyway, it's {{eight o'clock}} and soon, surely, breakfast will be ready. As soon as I hear the gong I {{can go in}} there. I wonder if I could find out first where the dining-room is. It used always to be marked across the door, but I don't seem to see it. Darn it, I'll ask that man in uniform. If I'm here {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> good <b>money</b> <b>to</b> get breakfast I guess I'm not scared to ask a simple question {{of a man in}} uniform. Or no, I'll not ask him.

The grill room or the palm room? Why, I tell you, young man, I just wanted to get some breakfast if it's--what? Do I want what? I didn't quite get that--a la carte? No, thanks--and, what's that? table de what? in the palm room? No, I just wanted--but it doesn't matter. I'll wait 'round here and look about till I hear the gong. Don't worry about me.|$|R
5000|$|Cranstoun's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson.He has said that Elvis Presley's was the first music he ever listened to, and Presley profoundly influenced his taste.He told an interviewer, [...] "As a kid I used <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> all <b>my</b> pocket <b>money</b> on vintage records from the '50's and '60's. I got it home, listened to it, loved it, sang along to it."His style draws heavily on music of this period.He said of his single Never Gonna Let You Go, [...] "Motown Soul fused with Rock 'n' Roll. Well, they said it could never be done so this song is going to prove them wrong." [...] Chris Evans described his vintage pop as, [...] "A squeeze of the Bee Gees, a bit of Billy Joel, a dash of Dean Friedman, and a ripple of Rodriguez." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{even at a}} preparatory school, a well-regulated boy may better himself: and I {{can tell}} you I did. I never was in any quarrels: I never was very high in the class or very low: {{but there was no}} chap so much respected:--and why? I'D ALWAYS MONEY. The other boys spent all theirs in the first day or two, and they gave me plenty of cakes and barley-sugar then, I can tell you. I'd no need <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>my</b> own <b>money,</b> for they would insist upon {{treating}} me. Well, in a week, when theirs was gone, and they had but their threepence a week to look to {{for the rest of the}} half-year, what did I do? Why, I am proud to say that three-halfpence out of the threepence a week of almost all the young gentlemen at Dr. Swishtail's, came into my pocket. Suppose, for instance, Tom Hicks wanted a slice of gingerbread, who had the money? Little Bob Stubbs, to be sure. [...] "Hicks," [...] I used to say, [...] "I'LL buy you three halfp'orth of gingerbread, if you'll give me threepence next Saturday." [...] And he agreed; and next Saturday came, and he very often could not pay me more than three-halfpence. Then there was the threepence I was to have THE NEXT Saturday. I'll tell you what I did for a whole half-year:--I lent a chap, by the name of Dick Bunting, three-halfpence the first Saturday for three-pence the next: he could not pay me more than half when Saturday came, and I'm blest if I did not make him pay me three-halfpence FOR THREE-AND-TWENTY WEEKS RUNNING, making two shillings and tenpence-halfpenny. But he was a sad dishonorable fellow, Dick Bunting; for after I'd been so kind to him, and let him off for three-and-twenty-weeks the money he owed me, holidays came, and threepence he owed me still. Well, according to the common principles of practice, after six-weeks' holidays, he ought to have paid me exactly sixteen shillings, which was my due. For the ...|$|R
