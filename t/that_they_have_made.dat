It has been observed, however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> adroit use of metal objects which have washed up or been left behind on their shores, having some ability at cold smithing and sharpening iron and incorporating it into weapons and other items. For example, in the late 1980s two international container ships ran aground on the island's external coral reefs; the Sentinelese retrieved several items of iron from the vessels.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that {{companies}} recognize ERM as a critical management issue. This is demonstrated through the prominence assigned to ERM within organizations and the resources devoted to building ERM capabilities. In a 2008 survey by Towers Perrin, at most life insurance companies, responsibility for ERM resides within the C-suite. Most often, the chief risk officer (CRO) or {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) is in charge of ERM, and these individuals typically report directly to the chief executive officer. From their vantage point, the CRO and CFO are able to look across the organization and develop a perspective on the risk profile of the firm and how that profile matches its risk appetite. They act as drivers to improve skills, tools and processes for evaluating risks and to weigh various actions to manage those exposures. Companies are also actively enhancing their ERM tools and capabilities. Three quarters of responding companies said they have tools for specifically monitoring and managing enterprise-wide risk. These tools are used primarily for identifying and measuring risk and for management decision making. Respondents also reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> good progress in building their ERM capabilities in certain areas.|$|E

25|$|The Interviews {{stage of}} the process takes place as the {{penultimate}} step of the competition, in which the five remaining candidates in the competition each undergoes an individual set of interviews with a selection of trusted aides of Lord Sugar; for the seventh and eighth series, this stage was assigned as the final step, and featured the four remaining candidate in each respective series' competition. In this stage, each interviewer questions the candidates over various matters, from their performance in the process, why they applied for the show, {{the content of their}} CVs, and their personal attitude with others, and often probe and scrutinise any brash, boastful, or controversial statements <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made,</b> including on their application forms and CVs, which can usually see them encouraged to prove such outlandish claims are truthful or were made up. The aim being to determine the suitability of the candidate for the prize being offered by Lord Sugar. Since the seventh series, following the change of prize, the interviewers now scrutinise a candidate on their business plan, determining how feasible it is, if the candidate can achieve the plan, as well as rooting out any potential flaws and issues that come with it.|$|E

Relating the song to Anthony, Lopez said she believes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> each other better artists and people. [...] "Run the World" [...] is a midtempo pop song that critics compared to Lopez's 2002 single [...] "Jenny from the Block".|$|E
500|$|Davies {{gave his}} maiden {{speech in the}} House of Commons on 21 June 1934. Breaking with the {{tradition}} that such speeches should be non-partisan, he delivered a fierce attack on the government's policy towards the mining industry. He had come, he said, from a coalfield that [...] "has had very little help from the present government... we see communities with a great industrial history dissolving and disintegrating". An uncompromising approach on any questions affecting Merthyr Tydfil, or the mining industry generally, became Davies's parliamentary hallmark. In December 1934 he rebuked the veteran Conservative MP Nancy Astor when she referred to Merthyr as having [...] "no social consciousness or initiative to do anything". Davies replied: [...] "I object to irresponsible and brutal charges coming from people whose knowledge {{is derived from the}} enjoyment of vast wealth, especially when I am not certain <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> their contribution towards producing that wealth".|$|E

500|$|Back in the present, {{the group}} {{make it to}} Founders Island where humans {{have been living in}} {{relative}} peace. While Kara seeks to make amends with Frieda, Finn and Jake discover that the island is full of Minerva look-alike robots called [...] "helpers". They are brought to the real Minervaa digitized consciousnesswhen Finn is identified as her son. Minerva reveals that she had Dr. Gross send Kara to retrieve Finn, but years had passed and Dr. Gross had accidentally released a deadly virus that was killing humans. Minerva had her essence uploaded into a computer, and then created the helpers to assist the human race. Now that she is with Finn, she expresses her desire that he stay permanently. Finn tries to convince Minerva that life off the island is not all bad, but Minerva thinks off-island life is dangerous. Finn then tries to convince the humans to leave, and they all rally alongside him. This causes Minerva to attempt to upload the consciousnesses of all the islands' inhabitants. To prevent this, Finn shares with her his memories of helping people, causing her to back down; she realizes that Ooo is not nearly a threat as she before believed. The humans all change their minds about leaving, except for Frieda. With Minerva's help, they defeat the colossus. Later, Kara and Frieda announce to Finn, Jake, and BMO <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> amends and are leaving to have their own adventures. Finn has one final talk with Minerva through the VR headset, where the two embrace in the digital realm. Finn then returns to Ooo with Jake and BMO.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno {{for his own}} thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out {{the similarities and differences}} between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.|$|E
2500|$|The shuttle, {{with the}} TARDIS inside, {{fall into a}} crack. The Doctor returns and the three take shelter at the colony. The Doctor asserts that the moon is really a giant, 100-million-year-old egg, ready to hatch, the spiders being the {{equivalent}} of sterilising microbes on its surface. [...] The Doctor gets Courtney to join them in the TARDIS. Lundvik becomes even more insistent {{to blow up the}} moon, unsure {{of the nature of the}} creature that might hatch, which angers the Doctor. The Doctor takes the TARDIS and abandons the three of them, but assures he will be back once they have made a decision. Lundvik prime a remote trigger for the nuclear bombs set on a timer, intent on finishing her mission. Lundvik, Clara, and Courtney argue what to do, and come to a conclusion to let the population of Earth decide. As shown in medias res at the start of the episode, Clara makes a plea over broadcast channels for Earth to decide the fate of the creature by leaving their lights on to allow the creature to live, or turning off their lights if they should destroy it. Over the next hour, they witness the lights on Earth turn off. Clara changes her mind at the last second and [...] manages to stop the countdown on the remote detonator. Shortly thereafter the Doctor arrives, assured <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the right choice, and evacuates them from the moon as it starts to crumble.|$|E
