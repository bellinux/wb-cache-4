5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 89 - 92. The {{purpose of}} my {{investigation}} was to study gender equality in one of Swaziland's secondary schools. This was a case study. The aim {{was to determine the}} extent to which gender equality was being practised, if at all. The study was based on socialization theories presented by some <b>feminists.</b> <b>The</b> theories discussed in this thesis are <b>the</b> Liberal <b>feminist</b> theory, <b>the</b> Socialist <b>feminist</b> theory, <b>the</b> Radical <b>feminist</b> theory, <b>the</b> Psychoanalytic <b>feminist</b> theory, <b>the</b> Postmodern <b>feminist</b> theory and <b>the</b> Third World <b>feminist</b> theory. Feminists believe that early socialization and sex-stereotyped attitudes about boys and girls have a fundamental effect on the processes of education in relation to teaching style and methodology and the way in which learning is negotiated by boys and girls. <b>Feminists</b> believe that <b>the</b> teachers as well as their fellow male students usually marginalize girls at school.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> held a more idealistic, psychologistic, and utopian philosophy, with {{a greater}} {{emphasis}} on [...] "sex roles", seeing sexism as rooted in [...] "complementary patterns of male and female behavior". They placed more emphasis on institutions, seeing marriage, family, prostitution, and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the [...] "sex-role system". They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed. Within the group, there were further disagreements, such as Koedt's viewing the institution of [...] "normal" [...] sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure, while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction. In contrast to <b>the</b> Redstockings, <b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male. Ellen Willis would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity, they saw it as a [...] "bitter price" [...] they [...] "might have to pay for their militance", whereas <b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> embraced separatist feminism as a strategy.|$|R
5|$|Over time, the {{traditional}} structure {{has had to}} adapt to very influential changes, including divorce {{and the introduction of}} single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and same-sex marriage, and increased interest in adoption. Social movements such as <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement and the stay-at-home father have contributed to the creation of alternative family forms, generating new versions of the American family.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>feminist</b> {{movement}} has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; {{greater access to}} education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); {{and the right to}} own property.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public pickets of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, Gloria Steinem, Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members of this group would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> and civil rights movements.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter {{supported}} {{the movement for}} the higher education of women, and had always supported <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> cause {{but for most of}} her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But she did in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage. She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868.|$|E
