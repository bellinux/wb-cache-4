5|$|The {{report states}} {{that there were}} <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> errors made during the {{planning}} stages. Firstly, the parking lot for the mall was located {{on the roof of}} the building without there being sound waterproofing, and secondly the structural inefficiency of the hollow concrete slabs which prevented the installation of effective waterproofing later on.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} edition did {{not appear}} until 1980, when the Edizioni musicali Otos in Florence published a version faithful to the composer's intentions, edited by Angelo Coan. Three new editions of the piano version were prepared celebrating Rossin's 200th anniversary in 1992: <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> editions by Oxford and Carus-Verlag, and one by Novello, with only one piano part.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{performance of the}} infantry, both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history. At the Persian siege of Amida, Ammianus' eye-witness account describes the city's defence by limitanei units as skilful and tenacious, if ultimately unsuccessful. At Strasbourg (357), the infantry showed remarkable skill, discipline and resilience throughout, saving the day at <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> moments.(see Battle of Strasbourg for a detailed account). Even at the disaster of Adrianople, the Roman infantry fought on, despite being abandoned by their cavalry and surrounded on three sides by overwhelmingly superior numbers of Goths.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, state courts have determined that Priority One and <b>Two</b> <b>Critical</b> Services must continue {{in the event of}} a shutdown. Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has {{provided}} the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans. <b>Two</b> <b>critical</b> opportunities {{to find a new}} home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|E

25|$|A {{superconductor}} can be TypeI, {{meaning it}} has a single critical field, above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or TypeII, meaning it has <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called vortices. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors {{it is possible to}} have combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of Type-1.5.|$|E

25|$|Natural gas {{processing}} changes the commodity in <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> ways. First, it extracts valuable by-products; second, it renders natural gas {{fit to be}} transported to a point for commercial sale and consumption. Through the use of evolving technology, the {{gas processing}} industry of each era extracts higher percentages of {{a wider range of}} hydrocarbons and other commercial by-products than its predecessors. It also removes ever-higher percentages of dangerous and other unwanted impurities. Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of gas flowing from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Eaton and William Mulholland were <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> {{actors in}} the California Water Wars. They were friends, having worked {{together}} in the private Los Angeles Water Company in the 1880s. In 1886, Eaton became City Engineer and Mulholland became superintendent of the Water Company. In 1898, Eaton was elected mayor of Los Angeles, and was instrumental in converting the Water Company to city control in 1902. When the company became the Los Angeles Water Department, Mulholland continued to be superintendent, due to his vast knowledge of the water system.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{comprehension}} {{and production of}} these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to people talking, <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded {{that she had not}} acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.|$|E

25|$|Project {{entrepreneurs}} are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks {{typical of the}} entrepreneurial process. Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> challenges that invariably characterize {{the creation of a}} new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity effectively. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project, and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|Van 't Hoff {{probably}} met De Stijl founder Theo van Doesburg {{some time}} in mid-1917. Their radical views on art and society had a natural affinity {{and by the end}} of the year van 't Hoff was in regular correspondence with van Doesburg and other members of the movement including Vilmos Huszár and J. J. P. Oud. Over the next two years he was to write five articles for the De Stijl journal – three radical essays on the future of architecture and <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> pieces on buildings by Jan Wils and Antonio Sant' Elia. Van 't Hoff went on to support the journal financially after van Doesburg split from its original publisher over his insistence on installing a separate architecture editor.|$|E
25|$|After the {{proposals}} for a tunnel died out in 1970, there remained <b>two</b> <b>critical</b> groups against the project: {{those who were}} in favor of the bridge, but critical to the details in the plan, and those who were opposed to a bridge and wanted to keep the ferry service. The former group was largely concerned about the choice of the outer route, rather than the inner crossing to Kvarven. The latter would give a significantly shorter route to the city center, and the same driving distance to places south of Bergen, including Bergen Airport, Flesland. Another issue was that there was not a sufficient road network in Bergen to handle the traffic from the bridge. Starting in late 1970, a petition was created demanding a referendum about which crossing should be chosen. The issue was discussed in the municipal council on 23 April, and was dismissed with five votes in favor of a referendum.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we derive some {{sufficient}} {{conditions under}} which the functional φ admits at least <b>two</b> distinct <b>critical</b> points; consequently, (1.1) admits at least two distinct solutions. We first introduce some assumptions.|$|R
40|$|We study Diophantine {{equations}} of type f(x) =g(y), {{where both}} f and g {{have at least}} <b>two</b> distinct <b>critical</b> points and equal critical values at at most <b>two</b> distinct <b>critical</b> points. Some classical families of polynomials (f_n) _n are such that f_n satisfies these assumptions for all n. Our results cover and generalize several results {{in the literature on}} the finiteness of integral solutions to such equations. In doing so, we analyse the properties of the monodromy groups of such polynomials. We show that if f has coefficients in a field K, at least <b>two</b> distinct <b>critical</b> points and all distinct critical values, and char(K) is not a divisor of the degree of f, then the monodromy group of f is a doubly transitive permutation group. This is the same as saying that (f(x) -f(y)) /(x-y) is irreducible over K. In particular, f cannot be represented as a composition of lower degree polynomials. We further show that if f has at least <b>two</b> distinct <b>critical</b> points and equal critical values at at most two of them, and if f(x) =g(h(x)), where g and h have coefficients in K and g is of degree at least 2, then either the degree of h is less or equal than 2, or f is of special type. In the latter case, in particular, f has no three simple critical points, nor five distinct critical points. Comment: 2...|$|R
