When the experimenter has a prior expectation that the variances of k populations are not less than the variance of a control population, one-sided simultaneous <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> provide more inferential sensitivity than <b>two-sided</b> simultaneous <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals.</b> But the <b>two-sided</b> simultaneous <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> have advantages over the one-sided simultaneous <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> as they provide both lower and upper bounds for the parameters of interest.

30|$|Because {{the results}} {{indicated}} {{the presence of an}} influential three-item cluster on the Qiyas for L 1 Arabic language test, two separate Rasch calibration analyses were conducted to determine if person measures were severely affected by the secondary dimension (Wright and Stone 1979; Linacre 2012 a, 2012 b). A confirmatory finding would indicate that those items should be either modified or removed from the Qiyas for L 1 Arabic language test, because the construct runs a risk of being distorted by this irrelevant sub-dimension. The first Rasch analysis targeted only the three-item cluster with positive loadings (writing accuracy). The second Rasch calibration targeted items with negative loadings. If the Qiyas for L 1 Arabic language test fits the Rasch standard, then the person measures should remain invariant, allowing for a reasonable number of errors, that is, the person measures obtained from the two calibrations should fall within the 95 % <b>two-sided</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>interval</b> (Bond and Fox 2007; Linacre 2012 a, 2012 b).|$|E
40|$|In many {{statistical}} applications, it {{is often}} necessary to obtain an interval estimate for an unknown proportion or probability or, more generally, for a parameter whose natural space is the unit interval.

Applying the principle of intersection-union tests, the method can be used to derive exact tests and <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> for functions of the two binomial parameters. Based on this, new exact unconditional <b>two-sided</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> are proposed for the risk difference and risk ratio.

The simulation study reveals that the performance of the new procedure is very robust to any configurations of population proportions provided that the sample size is sufficiently large.

40|$|Lee and Spurrier (1995) present one-sided and <b>two-sided</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>interval</b> {{procedures}} for making successive comparisons between ordered treatments. Their procedures have important applications for problems where the treatments {{can be assumed}} to satisfy a simple ordering, such as for a sequence of increasing dose-levels of a drug. The two-sided procedure provides both {{upper and lower bounds}} on the differences between successive treatments, whereas the one-sided procedure only provides lower bounds on these differences. However, the one-sided procedure allows sharper inferences regarding which treatments can be declared to be better than their previous ones. In this paper we apply the results obtained in Hayter, Miwa, and Liu (2000) to develop a new procedure which combines the good aspects of both the one-sided and the two-sided procedures. This new procedure maintains the inferential sensitivity of the one-sided procedure while also providing both upper and lower bounds on the differences between successive treatments.

40|$|In {{recent years}} various fields of single-case {{research}} including educational psychology {{and special education}} have seen an increasing demand for the reporting of confidence intervals and measures of effect size (ESs) in the reporting of scientific results. Here we present a method to construct nonparametric confidence intervals for single-case ESs {{in the context of}} various single-case designs. For this method we use the relationship between a two-sided statistical hypothesis test at significance level α and a 100 (1 – α) % <b>two-sided</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>interval.</b> This relationship implies that a confidence interval for a certain ES measure θ contains all point null hypothesis θ values that cannot be rejected by the hypothesis test at the significance level α (Neyman, 1937). Consequently, a method of hypothesis test inversion (HTI) can be derived that uses repeated randomization tests (RTs) to construct a nonparametric confidence interval for θ. We will refer to this procedure as randomization test inversion (RTI). In this paper we present the rationale behind this method and provide an illustration for a hypothetical single-case design. In addition we discuss the limitations of the method and some possibilities for future research. status: accepte...|$|E

We hypothesized that an oral appliance is not inferior to CPAP in treating obstructive sleep apnea effectively. We randomly assigned 103 individuals to oral-appliance or CPAP therapy. Polysomnography after 8 - 12 weeks indicated that treatment was effective for 39 of 51 persons using the oral appliance (76. 5 %) and for 43 of 52 persons using CPAP (82. 7 %). For the difference in effectiveness, a 95 % <b>two-sided</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>interval</b> was calculated. Non-inferiority of oral-appliance therapy was considered to be established when the lower boundary of this interval exceeded - 25 %. The lower boundary of the confidence interval was - 21. 7 %, indicating that oral-appliance therapy was not inferior to CPAP for effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. However, subgroup analysis revealed that oral-appliance therapy was less effective in individuals with severe disease (apnea-hypopnea index > 30). Since these people could be at particular cardiovascular risk, primary oral-appliance therapy appears to be supported only for those with non-severe apnea.
