5|$|TRH is {{secreted}} at {{an increased}} rate in situations such as cold exposure {{in order to}} stimulate <b>thermogenesis.</b> In addition to being suppressed {{by the presence of}} thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering <b>thermogenesis.</b> Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
25|$|In infants, the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-exercise-associated <b>thermogenesis,</b> also known as non-shivering <b>thermogenesis).</b> Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the {{inflorescence}} is {{of great}} importance in determining the species of a given philodendron, since {{it tends to be}} less variable than the leaves. The genus Philodendron could be classified further by means of differentiating them based on the pattern of <b>thermogenesis</b> observed, although this is not currently used.|$|E
25|$|Đaja {{began to}} {{research}} hypothermia in 1935 and from 1940 {{it became the}} focal point of his scientific work. He was especially interested in the ways it can be achieved. With his treatise State similar to the winter sleep of the hibernators achieved in rat by the means of barometric depression, published on 15 January 1940, he began researching the physiology of the deeply cooled homeothermous organisms. He was interested in <b>thermogenesis,</b> gas circulation in organisms, adaptation to cold, defense role of hypothermia and metabolism in deep hypothermia. His results from this period have found a wide application in medical physiology.|$|E
2500|$|Coupling with {{oxidative}} phosphorylation {{is a key}} step for ATP production. However, in specific cases, uncoupling the two processes may be biologically useful. The uncoupling protein, thermogenin—present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue—provides for an alternative flow of protons back to the inner mitochondrial matrix. [...] This alternative flow results in <b>thermogenesis</b> rather than ATP production. Synthetic uncouplers (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenol) also exist, and, at high doses, are lethal.|$|E
2500|$|The male beetles {{will stay}} {{overnight}} in the spathe, eating and mating throughout the night due to the benefits provided by the spathe and spadix. Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as <b>thermogenesis.</b> By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46°C in some species, but usually around 35°C. [...] The <b>thermogenesis</b> coincides {{with the arrival of}} the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20°C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to Philodendron and Monstera, as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the <b>thermogenesis</b> triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45° relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for <b>thermogenesis.</b> The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during <b>thermogenesis.</b> The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. [...] The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.|$|E
2500|$|A thermogenic {{is a broad}} {{term for}} any {{supplement}} that the manufacturer claims will cause <b>thermogenesis,</b> resulting in increased body temperature, increased metabolic rate, and consequently an increased rate in the burning of body fat and weight loss. Until 2004 almost every product found in this supplement category comprised the [...] "ECA stack": ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin. However, on February 6, 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of ephedra and its alkaloid, ephedrine, for use in weight loss formulas. Several manufacturers replaced the ephedra component of the [...] "ECA" [...] stack with bitter orange or citrus aurantium (containing synephrine) instead of the ephedrine.|$|E
2500|$|Brown fat {{or brown}} adipose tissue is a {{specialized}} form of adipose tissue in humans and other mammals. It is located mainly {{around the neck}} and large blood vessels of the thorax. This specialized tissue can generate heat by [...] "uncoupling" [...] the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. The process of uncoupling means that when protons transit down the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the energy from this process is released as heat rather than being used to generate ATP. This thermogenic process may be vital in neonates exposed to cold, which then require this <b>thermogenesis</b> to keep warm, as {{they are unable to}} shiver, or take other actions to keep themselves warm.|$|E
2500|$|PGE2 is the {{ultimate}} mediator of the febrile response. The set point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus [...] Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering <b>thermogenesis</b> to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.|$|E
2500|$|In many respects, the {{hypothalamus}} {{works like}} a thermostat. [...] When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. [...] Norepinephrine increases <b>thermogenesis</b> in brown adipose tissue, and acetylcholine stimulates muscle to raise metabolic rate. If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, then shivering begins {{in order to use}} muscle movements to produce more heat. [...] When the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline either spontaneously or with medication, the reverse of these processes (vasodilation, end of shivering and nonshivering heat production) and sweating are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.|$|E
50|$|Non-shivering <b>thermogenesis</b> is {{regulated}} mainly by thyroid hormone and the sympathetic nervous system. Some hormones, such as norepinephrine and leptin, may stimulate <b>thermogenesis</b> by activating the sympathetic nervous system. Rising insulin levels after eating {{may be responsible}} for diet-induced <b>thermogenesis</b> (thermic effect of food).Progesterone also increases body temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolic}} rate is increased, initially by non-shivering <b>thermogenesis,</b> followed by shivering <b>thermogenesis</b> if the earlier reactions are insufficient {{to correct the}} hypothermia.|$|E
50|$|In infants, the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-exercise-associated <b>thermogenesis,</b> also known as non-shivering <b>thermogenesis).</b> Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.|$|E

50|$|Since plateau pikas {{live in such}} {{extremely}} cold {{environments and}} are a non-hibernating species, they have acquired physiological adaptations to better assist with their survival. These adaptations include their high resting metabolic rate and non- shivering <b>thermogenesis</b> along with the production of leptin which is a <b>thermogenesis</b> regulatory hormone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermogenesis</b> is {{the process}} of heat {{production}} in organisms. It occurs in all warm-blooded animals, and also in a few species of thermogenic plants such as the Eastern skunk cabbage, the Voodoo lily, and the giant water lilies of the genus Victoria. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium americanum disperses its seeds explosively through <b>thermogenesis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Three sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, {{are located}} in {{mitochondria}} and have been implicated in regulating metabolic processes. Endogenous SIRT3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix. Overexpression of SIRT3 in cultured cells increases respiration and decreases the production of reactive oxygen species. Fasting increases SIRT3 expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT, respectively) and overexpression of SIRT3 in HIB1B brown adipocytes increases the expression of PGC-1α and UCP1, suggesting a role for SIRT3 in adaptive <b>thermogenesis</b> BAT. BAT is different from WAT because it harbors large numbers of mitochondria and is important for <b>thermogenesis</b> in rodents. <b>Thermogenesis</b> in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which induces proton leakage and thereby generates heat instead of ATP. Mechanistic insights into how SIRT3 affects <b>thermogenesis</b> in BAT is lacking and whether SIRT3 affects UCP1 activity directly is not known.|$|E

50|$|Obesity in orexin {{knockout}} mice is {{a result}} of inability of brown preadipocytes to differentiate into brown adipose tissue (BAT), which in turn reduces BAT <b>thermogenesis.</b> BAT differentiation can be restored in these knockout mice through injections of orexin. Deficiency in orexin has also been linked to narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. Furthermore, narcoleptic {{people are more likely to}} be obese. Hence obesity in narcoleptic patients may be due to orexin deficiency leading to impaired <b>thermogenesis</b> and energy expenditure.|$|E
50|$|The low {{demands of}} <b>thermogenesis</b> mean that {{free fatty acids}} draw, for the most part, on lipolysis as the method of energy production.|$|E

50|$|About 70% of a human's {{total energy}} {{expenditure}} {{is due to}} the basal life processes within the organs of the body (see table). About 20% of one's energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10% from <b>thermogenesis,</b> or digestion of food (postprandial <b>thermogenesis).</b> All of these processes require an intake of oxygen along with coenzymes to provide energy for survival (usually from macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and expel carbon dioxide, due to processing by the Krebs cycle.|$|E

50|$|In addition, glyceroneogenesis {{in brown}} adipose tissue {{is related to}} <b>thermogenesis</b> in the organism. In mammals, heat is {{generated}} by delivering free fatty acids to the mitochondria. When glyceroneogenesis is proceeding regularly, the concentration of free fatty acid is low in intercellular environment because glyceroneogenesis re-esterifies fatty acids to triglycerides. In other words, <b>thermogenesis</b> by free fatty acids {{is less likely to}} occur when glyceroneogenesis is proceeding. However, when exposed to cold, a neurotransmitter hormone called norepinephrine will suppress the activity of PEPC-K. When the activity of PEPC-K is suppressed, glyceroneogenesis will be unable to re-esterify the free fatty acids. Eventually, the free fatty acid concentration within the cell will increase leading to excessive free fatty acids in cytosol, which will consequently be delivered to the mitochondria for <b>thermogenesis.</b> Therefore, when a mammal is exposed to cold, heat is generated in the brown adipose tissue by decreasing the activity of glyceroneogenesis.|$|E

50|$|It {{is located}} mainly in adipose tissue and is {{involved}} in the regulation of lipolysis and <b>thermogenesis.</b> Some β3 agonists have demonstrated antistress effects in animal studies, suggesting it also has a role in the central nervous system (CNS). β3 receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brown adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought {{to play a role in}} lipolysis and <b>thermogenesis</b> in brown fat. In the urinary bladder it is thought to cause relaxation of the bladder and prevention of urination.|$|E
5000|$|... 7-Keto-DHEA {{demonstrates}} documented thermogenic {{activity in}} rats. This is accomplished through the activation of three thermogenic enzymes: Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, Malic Enzyme and Fatty Acyl CoA Oxidase. In {{keeping with the}} biological definition of <b>thermogenesis,</b> {{all three of these}} enzyme activations drive energy-producing substrates in a direction of less efficient ATP production relative to heat production. The enzymes also promote the utilization of fat stores for energy and heat production. This is the basis for the ability of 7-keto-DHEA to enhance <b>thermogenesis</b> and, through that mechanism, accelerate the utilization of fat stores for energy.|$|E

50|$|Responses to cold are {{produced}} by cutaneous cold sensitive pathways through the Parabrachial area. Thermoreceptors in the skin detect temperature in the environment relative to body temperature. These afferent neurons project up the spinal cord to the parabrachial area, which innervates several areas of the preoptic area, including the median preoptic nucleus. Exposure to cold leads to disinhibition of the RMR and other regions, which leads to brown adipose <b>thermogenesis.</b> This {{is also known as}} non-shivering <b>thermogenesis,</b> which metabolizes fat but dissipates heat from the proton motive force in mitochondria rather than using oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.|$|E
50|$|In this process, {{substances}} such as free {{fatty acids}} (derived from triacylglycerols) remove purine (ADP, GDP and others) inhibition of thermogenin, which causes an influx of H+ into the matrix of the mitochondrion and bypasses the ATP synthase channel. This uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and the energy from the proton motive force is dissipated as heat rather than producing ATP from ADP, which would store chemical energy for the body's use. <b>Thermogenesis</b> can also be produced by leakage of the sodium-potassium pump and the Ca2+ pump. <b>Thermogenesis</b> is contributed to by futile cycles, such as the simultaneous occurrence of lipogenesis and lipolysis or glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.|$|E
