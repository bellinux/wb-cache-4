Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of <b>the</b> <b>Pulpit</b> Law, a remnant of the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from <b>the</b> <b>pulpit.</b>|$|E

These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E

5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E
5|$|The 12th-century font {{was removed}} {{when the church}} was made redundant; it {{is now in the}} nearby church of St Maelog, Llanfaelog. The church now houses a 15th-century {{octagonal}} font made of gritstone, positioned on an octagonal stem. The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design; <b>the</b> <b>pulpit,</b> also 18th-century, has recessed panels.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the east}} and west ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits. They were {{arranged}} with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands. The lowest level was a drop table which was raised for use in <b>the</b> sacrament. <b>The</b> <b>pulpits</b> to <b>the</b> east, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood. Written in gilded letters along the arch of the ceiling, above <b>the</b> eastern <b>pulpits,</b> were <b>the</b> words [...] "The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice – Come After Us."

5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from <b>the</b> <b>pulpit.</b> Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With {{no need for}} elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. There was a need to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pulpits</b> and <b>the</b> pews {{are among}} the {{distinctive}} features of the interior. Two sets of <b>pulpits</b> grace <b>the</b> main floor with another two sets on the second floor.

Jones, who was later known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978, {{organized}} a religious convention that took place June 11 through June 15, 1956, at Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis. To draw crowds, Jones needed a religious headliner, so he arranged to share <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> with Branham.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of more radical Expressionism and Modernism {{can be seen}} in buildings such as Basil Spence's Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964–67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced blockwork and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, Bathgate (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture. The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central platform, with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind <b>the</b> <b>pulpit.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pulpit</b> {{has some}} 19th-century oak {{panelling}} and reuses some ornate 17th-century panel {{work that is}} decorated with pictures of cherubs, dragons, dogs and lions' heads. The pews are made of pine; the choir stalls also have some carved oak panels that may date from the 17th century. A reading desk from the 19th century reuses material from the 14th and 17th centuries, depicting a lion, a griffin and angels. The church also has an eight-sided sandstone font decorated with a carved cross.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> present <b>Pulpit</b> {{dates from}} 1903 and was {{designed}} and carved by Miss Editha Plowden. <b>The</b> original <b>pulpit</b> was taken to St John's Church, Bournemouth where it can still be seen today.|$|R

She was also able to preach in northern New England and <b>the</b> <b>pulpits</b> of Free-will Baptists, Methodists and Congregational churches.

5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. <b>The</b> <b>pulpit</b> dates from this time. William Morris, {{on behalf of the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the antiquity of the font – probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses – <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St David’s (the scholarly Basil Jones, bishop 1874–1897), in memory of his mother. It is in Beer stone ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints John and Paul by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in spandrels flanking, and a Gothic column with a large capital for a book rest. Opposite this is the usual brass eagle lectern. Both pulpit and lectern are placed in the archway between crossing and nave.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Peter was {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house {{was built in the}} late 17th century. The church consists of a north and south aisle, chancel and south west porch with the tower to the west. In the south aisle are encaustic tiles dating from the 13th century. The font is Norman while <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> is Jacobean. There is also a 16th-century Flemish altar triptych.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>pulpits</b> to <b>the</b> West end were {{reserved}} for the Aaronic Priesthood. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. <b>The</b> highest three <b>pulpits</b> bore <b>the</b> initials P.A.P., which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. <b>The</b> next lower <b>pulpits</b> had P.P.Q., for President of the Priests Quorum). [...] Again, the next had P.T.Q. for President of the Teachers Quorum and {{on the table at}} the bottom was written P.D.Q. for President of the Deacons Quorum.|$|R

50|$|Also in {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, Father Michael Rotti (1884-1894) built <b>the</b> <b>pulpits</b> to <b>the</b> side of the presbytery and the Tornaghi organ. In addition, the choir was {{equipped}} with stalls divided by fluted pilasters.|$|R
5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. <b>The</b> <b>pulpit</b> is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E
5|$|The second rector, Clarkson Dunn, served {{both the}} Newton {{congregation}} and St James in Knowlton. Dunn, {{who died in}} 1870, was honored by the town of Newton with the naming of two streets, Clarkson Street and Dunn Place, which frame {{the property of the}} parish's old parsonage. After a ten-year tenure, Dunn's son-in-law, Nathaniel Pettit, resigned in 1867 to become Sussex County's first Superintendent of Schools. Moffett, who served as rector for fifteen years, resigned from <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> to accept an appointment from President Grover Cleveland to become the American minister (essentially ambassador) to Greece in 1885.|$|E
5|$|With Protestant {{reinforcements}} {{arriving from}} neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to Dunbar. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops {{were on the}} verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from <b>the</b> <b>pulpit</b> of St Giles', the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.|$|E
