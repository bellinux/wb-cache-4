5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided {{to build their own}} studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if she would be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for a single theatrical release, on 13 March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the film adaptation of Deathly Hallows would be split into two parts <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the book and {{out of respect for}} its fans.Yates, director ofthe previous two films,was confirmed to return as director, and Kloves was confirmed as screenwriter. For {{the first time in the}} series, Rowling was credited as a producer alongside Heyman and Barron, however Yates noted that her participation in the filmmaking process did not change from the previous films. Pre-production began on 26 January 2009, while principal photography began on 19 February at Leavesden Studios, where the previous six instalments were filmed. Pinewood Studios became the second studio location for shooting the seventh film. The premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was held on 11 November 2010, at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, and the film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 19 November.|$|E

Chris Gregson of GameSpot said, [...] "Its uninspired arcade-style biking action doesn't come close <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the big-name license.".

IGN gave the game a similarly negative review, criticizing the lackluster gameplay, along with the complex multiplayer and GPU configuration options menus, to which the IGN staff viewed as too complicated for its target audience.|$|R

25|$|Pauline Quirke {{was cast}} as secretive caravan {{resident}} Susan Wright. Chibnall {{had long been}} deeply impressed with her performance on the 1996 television series The Sculptress, and he wrote the role of Susan Wright with Quirke in mind, although the role was not written specifically for her. Although Quirke was a well-known veteran television actress, she auditioned along with many others for the role. Her audition, like that of others, used scenes from the first two episodes. Chibnall says that the producers worried that such a big star might not wish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> such small role, but found that Quirke delivered a superb performance.|$|E

Aung San Suu Kyi is a former honorary Elder. During her period under house arrest, the Elders kept an empty chair at each of their meetings to mark their solidarity with Suu Kyi and Burma's other political prisoners. In line with the requirement that members of The Elders should not hold public office, Suu Kyi stepped down as an honorary Elder following her election to parliament on 1 April 2012. Li Zhaoxing was present at the launch of The Elders but did not formally join the group.|$|E
25|$|Wolf was {{an active}} agent in his father's {{financial}} transactions, and shared his dignity as court factor. He later experienced great reverses of fortune, however. Having invested {{a large part of}} his wealth in loans to the Bavarian government, the stipulated terms of repayment were not kept, and bankruptcy stared him in the face. For a time he was able to pay only half of the interest on the 150,000 florins which Samson Wertheimer had donated to charity, and of which Wolf was trustee. On his father's donation of 22,000 florins in favor of the German Jews in Palestine he did not pay any interest after 1733. His embarrassment was ended by Elector Maximilian, who liquidated his debts. In his will (1762) Wolf declared that, although entailing a great loss upon him, he accepted this liquidation in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> his creditors. Further, he enjoined his children to pay in full his father's donation of 22,000 florins, although in 1759 he (Wolf) had returned to the Frankfurt congregation 10,000 florins which it had contributed to this fund.|$|E

25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge's men {{initially}} {{broke the}} Union line and forced {{them across the}} river. Artillery {{on the opposite side}} of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, [...] nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, [...] "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans," [...] bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report [...] "fails... <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in {{numerous}} policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights. The historian David Kynaston cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age; her successor as education minister, George Tomlinson, recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date. Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the North Mail, complained in May 1937 that [...] "Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> Jarrow". Nevertheless, her book The Town that was Murdered brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes, [...] "educated the nation".|$|E

He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's {{the kind of person}} that lends himself to becoming bad over the course of the comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven... So I would like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books".|$|E
500|$|Brett Makedonski of Destructoid had a mixed {{response}} to ReCore. Though describing {{the game to}} be [...] "brimming with ideas", Makedonski criticized the design for being injurious to its foundation. He felt the fetch quests were repetitive and over represented {{as part of the}} gameplay experience, and that it failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the narrative. Makedonski praised the game's controls, but had issues with the combat for its tedious nature and inability to advance. Keri Honea of Game Revolution showed little enthusiasm for the game, considering the dungeon raids [...] "formulaic", boring and repetitive. The unlockable [...] "Arena Dungeons" [...] were declared unintelligible {{in the context of the}} game's established world. In addition to combat abilities being recounted as [...] "pointless and padded", loading times – lasting up to 4 minutes – also met charges of criticism. Honea concluded that the [...] "first couple of hours of ReCore were almost downright magical" [...] but grew disenchanted with everything but the story, which was seen as its only redeeming quality.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the wit of the book.
