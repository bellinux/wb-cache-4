2500|$|John Smeaton made an {{important}} contribution to the development of cements while planning the construction of the third Eddystone Lighthouse (1755–59) in the English Channel now known as Smeaton's Tower. He needed a hydraulic mortar that would set and develop some strength in the twelve-hour period between successive high tides. He performed experiments with combinations of different limestones and additives including <b>trass</b> and pozzolanas and did exhaustive market research on the available hydraulic limes, visiting their production sites, and noted that the [...] "hydraulicity" [...] of the lime was directly related to the clay content of the limestone from which it was made. Smeaton was a civil engineer by profession, and took the idea no further.|$|E

[...] "Traveling is the only passion that doesn't need to feel shy in front of intellect," [...] wrote Meri. Urban people still have an inner urge to see the world, hunger for nature. Meri did not underestimate the drawbacks of mass tourism but concluded that [...] "science will liberate us from the chains of big cities and lead us back to nature".|$|E
2500|$|The {{foundations}} were sunk to a {{depth of}} 1 meter into the rock. The wall was constructed of rubble masonry in a total amount of 248480 cubic meters (325,000 cubic yards). The faces are finished with shaped blocks, between [...]45 and [...]3m thick and [...]6–.4m long. [...] The ends dovetail into solid rock, cut into 1m steps. The sandstone or limestone for the wall came from area quarries located no closer than 50 meters (164 feet) from the site and at a higher elevation than the crown. Building materials were transported on two narrow-gauge railways. The grouting for the rubble blocks was compacted from four parts sand, one part <b>trass</b> delivered in lumps from Andernach, and five parts slaked lime from Tournai, which was known for the quality of its hydraulic lime.|$|E

As a result effects of the non-linear spectroscopy have been investigated for the case of bounded light beams and long optical <b>trasses.</b> The effect of non-trivial guided lenses has been detected and investigated. The influence of effects of the beam self-action in experiments of the non-linear laser spectroscopy on longitudinal <b>trasses</b> has been estimated. The investigation results have been introduced into operation. The algorithms for the numerical analysis of space and spectral characteristics of laser beams in non-linear resonance media have been developed.

40|$|Statistical {{characteristics}} of a SW-signal are considered in the paper aiming at the investigation of an average value and dispersion for the intensity of a field, propagation by a quasicritical method in ionosphere with random large-scale heterogeneities. As a results expressions for the average intensity of reflected and refracted radio signals from a sporadic E layer have been obtained in frameworks of the model suggested. The effect of the amplification of the average intensity for a field of upper beams in random-heterogeneous ionosphere has been investigated. The uniform realively "light - shadow" regions asymptotical representation for the index of twinklings has been obtained for the first time. The dependences obtained of the half-transparence frequency range for a sporadic E layer {{and the effect of}} the average intensity increase for a field of upper beams on parameters of random heterogeneities may be used at the forecasting of radio <b>trasser,</b> but indexes of twinklings may be used at the reliability establishment of the radio line workAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of modern Portland cement (sometimes called ordinary or normal Portland cement) began in 1756, when John Smeaton experimented with combinations of different limestones and additives, including <b>trass</b> and pozzolanas, {{relating to the}} planned construction of a lighthouse, now known as Smeaton's Tower. In the late 18th century, Roman cement was developed and patented in 1796 by James Parker; Roman cement quickly became popular, but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the 1850s. [...] In 1811, James Frost produced a cement he called British cement. [...] James Frost {{is reported to have}} erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826. [...] In 1843, Aspdin's son William improved their cement, which was initially called 'Patent Portland cement', although he had no patent. In 1818, French engineer Louis Vicat invented an artificial hydraulic lime considered the 'principal forerunner' of Portland cement and, '...Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of this kind in 1811'. [...] Portland cement was used by Joseph Aspdin in his cement patent in 1824 because of the cement's resemblance to Portland stone. The name 'Portland cement' is also recorded in a directory published in 1823 being associated with a William Lockwood, a Dave Stewart, and possibly others. [...] However, Aspdin's cement was nothing like modern Portland cement, but was a first step in the {{development of}} modern Portland cement, called a 'proto-Portland cement'.|$|E

It much resembles the Italian pozzolana and is applied to like purposes. Mixed with lime and sand, or with Portland cement, it is extensively employed for hydraulic work, especially in the Netherlands; while the compact varieties have been used as a building material and as a fire-stone in ovens. <b>Trass</b> was formerly worked extensively in the Brohl valley and is now obtained from the valley of the Nette, near Andernach.|$|E

In 1958 she married Reino <b>Trass</b> (1928-2013) in Toronto. She was shocked to find that there were no Montessori schools in southern Ontario, despite the growing popularity of the Montessori Method.
