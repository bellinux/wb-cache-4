40|$|ABSTRACT: A state {{register}} that stores {{the state}} of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. There is one special start state with which the state register is initialized. These states, writes Turing, replace the "state of mind " a person performing computations would ordinarily be in. It is like bank ledger, which has Debits and Credits. Note that in double entry computation, both debits and credits are entered in to the systems, namely <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Ledger</b> and balance is posted. Individual Debits are equivalent to individual credits. On a generalizational and globalist scale, a “General Ledger ” is written which records in all its wide ranging manifestation the Debits and Credits. This is also conservative. In other words Assets is equivalent to Liabilities. True, Profit is distributed among overheads and charges, and there shall be another account in the General ledger that is the account of Profit. This account is credited with the amount earned as commission, exchange, or discount of bills. Now when we write the “General Ledger ” of Turing machine, the Primma Donna and terra firma of the model, we are writing the General Theory of all the variables that are incorporated in the model. So for every variable, we have an anti variable. This is the dissipation factor. Conservation laws do hold well in computers. They do not break the conservation laws. Thus energy is not dissipated in to the atmosphere when computation is being performed. To repeat we are suggesting a General Theory Of working of a simple Computer and in further papers, we want to extend this theory to both nanotechnology and Quantum Computation. Turing’s work is the proponent, precursor, primogeniture, progenitor and promethaleon for the development of Quantum Computers. Computers follow conservation laws. This work is one whic...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop a}} {{progressive}} comparable to <b>Bank’s</b> General <b>Ledger,</b> {{and call it}} a General Theory of all the problems under the head of NP hard problems. Problems have their variables. For instance “Travelling Sales man problem ” can have various different cities. Based upon parameters classification is done and stability analysis, asymptotic stability and Solutional behaviour of the equations are investigated We eschew from stating any primary predications, coextensive representations, predicational anteriority of the Problems attributed to space constraints. In consideration to the parametric based classification and there is both ontological consonance, primordial exactitude, and phenomenological testimony as one finds in <b>Bank’s</b> <b>ledgers.</b> General Ledger is in fact the statement of all inflows and outflows and such a one as that occurs in problems and theories in some conditions, like for example the conservation of energy breaking down in Hawking’s radiation. Emphasis is laid on the fact that for instance a travelling salesman makes some move and then retracts to redress his move or starts another move to further his final destination. And this destination is General Ledger. -The General Theory Of all the NP (hard) problems [...] It is a journey, a journey to find the final balance which probably never ends like an account never closes.

40|$|It is {{more than}} two decades since {{literary}} scholars first began exploring the impact of the eighteenth-century financial revolution, especially the general extension of credit, on literary culture of the period. Yet one humble aspect of this revolution has rarely been appreciated by literary scholars: the growth of personal banking. Anyone who has searched through eighteenth-century <b>banking</b> <b>ledgers</b> will be aware of the growth of the customer base {{over the course of the}} period, with some of this additional business being supplied by writers and other members of the literary trade. The purpose of my article is to shed light on how eighteenth-century writers managed their affairs through the services afforded by banks, as well as in some cases through entering into financial arrangements outside <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector. <b>The</b> most eminent literary figure of the early eighteenth century was undoubtedly Pope, who was sufficiently successful for the protection and investment of his earnings to present a considerable logistical problem. Although he benefited from informal banking services provided by wealthy friends, he still opened at least six bank accounts with different providers over the course of his life. My article concludes by taking Pope’s personal banking habits as a case-study, seeking to understand these as a discrete aspect of how he managed his professional career. Overall, I hope this essay will assist future scholarship by identifying some of the rewards and pitfalls of using bank archival material as a source for literary enquiry...|$|R
