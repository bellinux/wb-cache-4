5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1936 {{elections}} in which FDR {{won by a}} landslide and his party expanded its majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress, the League eliminated its public activities and restricted itself to reviewing legislation and sending its assessments <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> A small national staff remained, but all state and local offices closed. Only the three du Pont brothers, Irénée, Lammot and Pierre, financed the organization, until the du Ponts decided to devote as much of their financial resources as possible to Republican Willkie's 1940 campaign. The League closed its Washington office in September 1940.|$|E

In spite of this, Frank's own baggage and 12% approval rating only allows him a tie with Conway in the House, while Claire manages to secure the Senate vote, becoming acting president. In light of the tie, Claire orders a special election for Ohio and Tennessee. Meanwhile, Jane Davis, a low-ranking Commerce Department official who has a wide-ranging network of connections and influence, begins working closely with the Underwoods.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780. The army was well aware that Congress had {{made no effort to}} back up this promise. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing their grievances and Alexander McDougall presented it to Congress in company with Matthias Ogden and John Brooks. Differing from earlier petitions, this one spoke for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> that the officers' claims were legitimate. Unfortunately, the Congress defeated a measure that would have given the officers full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension.|$|E

25|$|Although {{saved from}} fire, the Declaration of Independence did suffer {{in years to}} come from the unanticipated ill effects of {{exposure}} and handling. Perhaps the most destructive action occurred in 1823 when the document was used to make a press copy as a master for making facsimile copies to distribute <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> governors, the Supreme Court and others including the three surviving signers—John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and John Carroll. As a result of pressing, {{a large portion of the}} ink was lifted from the document. Over the years, rolling and folding of the document creased and broke the parchment, and constant exposure to strong sunlight led to fading of the signatures to the extent that some could not be read.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
500|$|General Washington {{assigned}} Arnold to {{the defense}} of Rhode Island, following the British seizure of Newport in December 1776, where the militia were too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British. Arnold took the opportunity to visit his children while near his home in New Haven, and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston, where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois. [...] In February 1777, he learned that he had been passed over by Congress for promotion to major general. [...] Washington refused his offer to resign, and wrote <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in an attempt to correct this, noting that [...] "two or three other very good officers" [...] might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Saxbe fix" [...] reentered {{the public}} lexicon in 2008 with the {{speculation}} that Senator Hillary Clinton was President-elect Barack Obama's preferred nominee to be Secretary of State, fueled by Obama's confirmation of his intent to nominate Clinton December 1, 2008. Clinton's relevant Senate term {{began with the}} seating of the 110th United States Congress on January 3, 2007, following her 2006 re-election. During that time, United States Cabinet salaries were increased from $186,600 to $191,300 in January 2008, and to $196,700 in January 2009. These pay raises were by executive order in accordance with cost of living adjustment statutes, as noted by legal scholar Eugene Volokh on his blog, The Volokh Conspiracy. Before the January 2009 pay increases, secretaries made $191,300 compared <b>to</b> <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> who earned $169,300.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} the Housing and Economic Recovery Act was signed into law, Representative Al Green of Texas {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} have permitted the FHA to insure mortgage loans that had seller-funded down payments, so long as the home buyers had FICO credit scores that were above a specified minimum (but, in some cases, the buyers would have been assessed higher mortgage-insurance premiums by the FHA). [...] Nehemiah supported this legislation and established a web site—the now-defunct dpagroundswell.org—that sought to generate public support through various means, including a letter-writing campaign <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> [...] Although the bill succeeded in getting approval from the House Committee on Financial Services, it was never voted on by the entire House and, hence, did not become law. [...] With this legislative failure, the seller-funded down-payment industry, including Nehemiah, ceased operations as of October 1, 2008. [...] By that time, the Nehemiah Program had assisted over 300,000 home buyers with over $1 billion in down payments.|$|E
500|$|The {{wagon train}} reached Albuquerque, New Mexico on June 23 and {{prepared}} for the journey to the Colorado River by way of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, where, despite Udell's lone dissent, they would become the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road. Udell, writing in his journal, explained his concern: [...] "I thought it was preposterous to start on so long a journey with so many woman and helpless children, and so many dangers attending the attempt." [...] According to Baley, the emigrants first learned of the recently surveyed road while visiting Albuquerque. Townspeople and army officers, including Benjamin Bonneville, encouraged them to take the new route, which was shorter than the established southern trails by , or approximately thirty days travel. They were also told {{that there was a}} reliable supply of food and water along the way, and the area was free of hostile Native Americans. E.F.

500|$|It was {{not unusual}} in {{military}} establishments {{of the time that}} individuals passed over for promotion were expected to resign, so Arnold on March 12 wrote to Washington, offering his resignation, or alternatively asking for a court of inquiry.

Weston reportedly walked around the metal detector just inside the entrance; Chestnut requested he go back through the detector. Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut {{in the back of the}} head at point-blank range.

500|$|Copper prices {{began to}} rise in 1973, {{to such an extent}} that the {{intrinsic}} value of the coin approached a cent, and citizens began to hoard cents, hoping to realize a profit. [...] The Mint decided to switch to an aluminum cent. [...] Over a million and a half such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973, though they were dated 1974. [...] At congressional hearings, representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment, and the Mint backed away from its proposal. [...] Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> but 14 remained missing, with the recipients affecting not to know what had become of them. [...] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection; another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer. [...] Experiments were also conducted with bronze-clad steel cents. [...] Slated for disposal, when a bag of them tore open before going into a smelter a few were kept by the workers. [...] They are also considered to be illegally held government property. [...] Recognizing that a change from the current copper composition was still inevitable, Congress passed Public Law 93-441 on October 11, 1974, declaring [...] "henever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury such action is necessary to assure an adequate supply of coins to meet the national needs, he may prescribe such composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent piece as he may deem appropriate." ...|$|E

Examples in Dupont Circle include memorials honoring Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, and Lajos Kossuth of Hungary. [...] The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898. [...] Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal. [...] A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled [...] "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). [...] Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters <b>to</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> while Lev Dobriansky, a Ukrainian American economist and anti-communism activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko. [...] The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan. [...] Javits said [...] "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand {{in the capital of}} the U.S." [...] and Bentley stated, [...] "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people." ...|$|E
