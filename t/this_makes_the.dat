5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> moth's overall colour polarization-dependent.

5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E

5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin.

5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the lackluster {{reception}} by critics, Super Collider debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, selling 29,000 copies in the U.S. in its first week.

Other A5-based devices will also support iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions).|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|The Snow Prince Gasshōdan {{group is}} a {{temporary}} boy choir that was formed specially for this movie, and it is led by actor Shintaro Morimoto.

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love.

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since <b>this</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself.

5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
