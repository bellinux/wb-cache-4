It stated that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure. Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups were found to have deliberately targeted Israeli civilians and sought to spread terror in southern Israel by mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks. The report's conclusions were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.|$|E
5|$|After the uprising, Poland {{repressed}} Lithuanian {{cultural life}} in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to Lithuanians, the repressions {{were even more}} far-reaching, including a ban on public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian Łossowski notes <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1861, both {{federal and}} Confederate troops entered Kentucky. Magoffin {{declared}} both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality and demanded <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> withdraw. A {{resolution calling for}} immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention.|$|E

5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{fighting}} {{broke out}} between ZANLA and ZIPRA {{members of a}} recently integrated Zimbabwe National Army battalion at Ntabazinduna, just north-east of Bulawayo, the two guerrilla camps at Entumbane began exchanging rifle, machine gun and mortar fire at about 20:00 on 11 February. Dyck, at the Alamo, reported <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> were also attacking his position. He radioed Brigade HQ for instructions and was told to pull out; he replied that this was impossible as he was surrounded. At Shute's orders, McKenna mobilised {{the rest of the}} battalion at an airfield near Brady Barracks within an hour. Meanwhile, a detachment of ZIPRA armoured vehicles left Essexvale for Bulawayo, and was spotted on the road by one of McKenna's observation posts. Devine was sent with his Elands to intercept them, supported by 12 1RAR men under Major Tony Husher. At an intersection {{on the outskirts of the}} city, Devine encountered a ZIPRA BTR-152 APC and impacted it with a single high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round, killing all 20 combatants inside. McKenna then told Devine to advance to the city limits, where he and Husher set up an ambush on the road. Husher's men shot out all nearby overhead street lights, and some of them went to scout ahead; Devine positioned two of his Elands on each of the two lanes of the road under cover of darkness.|$|E

5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
