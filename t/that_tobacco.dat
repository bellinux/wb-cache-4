25|$|In 1765 {{the crown}} created a {{monopoly}} on tobacco, which directly affected agriculture and manufacturing the Veracruz region. Tobacco was a valuable, high demand product. Men, women, and even children smoked, something commented on by foreign travelers and depicted in eighteenth-century casta paintings. The crown calculated <b>that</b> <b>tobacco</b> could produce {{a steady stream of}} tax revenues by supplying the huge Mexican demand, so the crown limited zones of tobacco cultivation. It also established a small number of manufactories of finished products, and licensed distribution outlets (estanquillos). The crown also set up warehouses to store up to a year's worth of supplies, including paper for cigarettes, for the manufactories. With the establishment of the monopoly, crown revenues increased and there is evidence that despite high prices and expanding rates of poverty, tobacco consumption rose {{while at the same time}} general consumption fell.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship {{is the role of the}} tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the idea that people with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and <b>that</b> <b>tobacco</b> is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Chandigarh {{became the}} first {{city-state}} of India to become smoke-free in July 2007. Social activist Hemant Goswami did pioneering work to make Chandigarh smoke-free. Inspired {{by the success of}} Chandigarh, the then Union Health Minister Dr. Ambumani Ramadoss enacted the new smoke-free regulation in 2008. India banned smoking in public places on 2 October 2008. Nearly a decade earlier, on 12 July 1999, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring public smoking as illegal (the first time in the world), unconstitutional, and violative of Article 21 of the constitution. The bench headed by Dr. Justice K. Narayana Kurup, held <b>that</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoking in public places (in the form of cigarettes, cigars, beedies or otherwise) falls within the mischief of the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in the Indian Penal Code and within the definition of air pollution as contained in the statutes dealing with protection and preservation of environment, in particular, Prevention and Control of Pollution Act 1981.|$|E

[...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this.

2500|$|The late-19th-century {{invention}} of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South {{made it possible}} to mass-produce cigarettes at low cost, and cigarettes became elegant and fashionable among society men as the Victorian era gave way to the Edwardian. In 1912, American Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung cancer is related to smoking. In 1924, economist Irving Fisher wrote an anti-smoking article for the Readers Digest, which said [...] "... tobacco lowers the whole tone of the body and decreases its vital power and resistance ... tobacco acts like a narcotic poison, like opium, and like alcohol, though usually in a less degree". In 1929, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published a formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer-tobacco link, based on a study showing that lung cancer sufferers were likely to be smokers. Lickint also argued <b>that</b> <b>tobacco</b> use {{was the best way to}} explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less).|$|E

[...] In North America cannabis {{in any form}} is also often [...] "chased" [...] with a tobacco cigarette, and hollowed-out cigars filled with cannabis (blunts) are also popular in some subcultures. [...] Some users say that smoking tobacco increases the cannabis high, and this is often attributed to either the nicotine or additives such as menthol. [...] Until recently this was based solely on anecdotal evidence. [...] There may be at least some truth to this legend, as a 2005 study found that a transdermal nicotine patch modestly enhanced the subjective [...] "high" [...] of cannabis relative to a placebo patch—but only in males. [...] Females actually saw a slight reduction in subjective effects. [...] Reasons for the enhancement are not well understood, and this study {{appears to be the}} only one as of 2010 that found such effects. [...] However, another study found a significant downside to the practice. [...] It appears <b>that</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which is known to be highly addictive, also enhances the likelihood of developing cannabis dependence symptoms when the two substances are used concurrently.|$|E
