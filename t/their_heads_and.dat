5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|Tropicbirds are slender white {{birds of}} {{tropical}} oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers. <b>Their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> long wings have black markings.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound eyes {{on the sides of}} <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
50|$|The {{associated}} mechanism varies between individuals, as <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> ear shapes differ.|$|R

5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds his opponent upside-down and around his back. He grabs <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> falls to a seated position to caused <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck to be forced into the mat, a move he dubbed the Sudden Death. Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|R
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan {{died from}} a heart attack {{backstage}} at the Royal Opera House during a performance of Mayerling. Jeremy Isaacs, the general director of the Royal Opera House, announced the death from the stage after the performance and asked the audience to rise and bow <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> leave the theatre in silence. On the same night the junior company was presenting MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet in Birmingham. MacMillan had nearly finished work on the dances for a new production of Carousel by the National Theatre, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre six weeks later, with his family and many of his friends in the audience.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
50|$|Suits {{intended}} for long-term worksuit use, or donned by rescue personnel, typically have a form-fitting neck-encircling seal, with a hood that {{conforms to the}} shape of the chin. This design is both more comfortable and allows the wearer to easily turn <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> look up or down. The suit material is designed to be either loose or elastic enough to allow the wearer to pull the top of the suit up over <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> then down around their neck.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} {{low levels of}} damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab-e-Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation. In Changureh, only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred. Ab Darreh also fared poorly; the disaster destroyed the town's only mosque, toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people. North of Avaj, {{in the village of}} Esmailabad, survivors recovered 38 corpses, a ninth of the total population, while searching for the missing, feared trapped in the ruins. In another village in the vicinity, Aliabad, two shepherds were the only known survivors. In the small village of Kisse-Jin, roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture. Survivors crying and beating <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> faces over loved ones were a common sight on Iranian state television.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually {{at the bottom of}} <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E

5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians in the back of <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E
50|$|C. antennatus has {{a maximum}} length of 38 cm. They have 10-12 short, fixed spines with fleshy sheaths on <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body. These are {{arranged}} in an approximate row from the snout to the dorsal fin, with {{the ones on the}} sides and top of body being more vertically erect. They have long tentacles above the eyes and small black spots on <b>their</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body.Like all members of the Diodontidae family, C. antennatus has the ability to inflate their body through the swallowing of water or air. This, along with the spines, protects them against most predators.|$|R

5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E
