5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E

25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, as <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front <b>wheel,</b> braking on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|R
50|$|The three-speed bicycle is {{a bicycle}} that uses {{internal}} hub gears at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> hub to provide three gear ratios. Typically, in low gear, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> sprocket turns {{faster than the}} wheel; in middle gear, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> sprocket turns {{at the same speed}} as the wheel; in high gear, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> turns faster than the sprocket.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1923–1924 the car {{was sent to the}} {{aircraft}} maker Boulton Paul at Norwich, for wind tunnel tests.

25|$|Small sidepod {{winglets}} {{were significantly}} altered {{prior to the}} 2008 French Grand Prix, providing twin turning vanes to better control airflow over {{the rear of the}} car. At the Canadian Grand Prix tweaks were also made to the flip-up flaps in front of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> to reduce drag. For the Italian Grand Prix, at the low-downforce Monza circuit, Williams tweaked the design of the FW30's bodywork, and front and rear wings. Sporting only a single element, with its outer edges turned upward, the rear wing was designed to reduce drag on Monza's long, fast straights, while still providing sufficient downforce during cornering. Final adjustments were made to the FW30's rear aerodynamics prior to the Brazilian Grand Prix. Here, the small winglets in front of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> were augmented by the addition of a small flap beneath their main elements, in order to better deflect airflow around the wheels and reduce the aerodynamic disruption caused by the wheels' rotation.|$|E

25|$|The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was {{released}} in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo motor show. Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|E
