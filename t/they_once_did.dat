5|$|One block {{north of}} NY79, NY96 splits from NY13 and NY34 and {{heads to the}} west at Buffalo Street. NY89 begins here, and NY96 {{overlaps}} with NY89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY13 and NY34, NY89 and NY96 run parallel to and a few feet {{to the north of}} NY79. NY89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY79. They do not intersect in this area—known locally as The Octopus—though <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did.</b> At one time, NY96, NY79, NY89, NY13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY13A and NY79 intersect there while the stub of former NY89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.|$|E
5|$|The only {{discontinued}} awards {{which were}} instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, {{which are not}} voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did.</b> An additional award, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award. Beginning an 2018, an unnamed Best Young Adult Book award, also not formally a Hugo Award, will be run similar to the Campbell Award.|$|E

25|$|Pacu were {{introduced}} in 1994 to the Sepik River, and in 1997 to the Ramu river as a food source, due to overfishing of native species. Local people blame the fish for outcompeting native species, including juvenile crocodiles, {{as well as for}} several attacks on humans. As a primarily vegetarian fish, red-bellied pacu, have also consumed the floating mats of vegetation in the Sepik River, which operated as fish nurseries and crocodile and bird nesting sites. Thus the entire ecosystem has become impoverished and local people cannot subsist as easily as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

In the other two conditions, they were told they would not receive caffeine; in one they did not, but in the other they did.

Results showed many effects of the drug and expectancy, but were inconclusive about which model governs drug taking behavior...|$|R
25|$|In the UK, popular {{archaeology}} {{programs such}} as Time Team and Meet the Ancestors {{have resulted in a}} huge upsurge in public interest. Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did,</b> and many local archaeological organizations operate within the Community archaeology framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines. Certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours.|$|E
25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did,</b> the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E

Unable to survive and reproduce as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did,</b> they have been [...] "brought {{to the brink of}} extinction". [...] Endangered species listings and a subsequent lawsuit by Willamette Riverkeeper led to a plan to improve fish passage and other actions to help native fish recover in 2008. Since then, work has proceeded slowly, and the Corps, citing engineering difficulties and cost, may not meet the original agreed-upon deadline of 2023 for a system of effective remedies.|$|E
500|$|Grand Met {{also made}} several moves {{in an attempt}} to broaden BK's {{business}} operations while expanding its presence globally. The first move by the company was the creation of the BK Expressway business concept, a new store format designed for locations where a traditional stand-alone restaurant was impractical. The company introduced two separate formats designed to operate in different business environments; the first concept was intended as a kiosk-type store that would be placed in locations such as sports venues and airports. The second concept store, designed with two drive-thrus and a minimal or even non-existent dining room, was designed to go in locations that were limited by high land costs or limited space. Both types of these new, smaller stores operated with a condensed menu prepared on new equipment designed specifically for the more compact footprints of the new locations. Expressway locations were also designed with lower start-up costs in mind; franchisees were wooed with the promise of a much smaller investment, approximately one third as much, than would be required to open a more traditional location. In August of the same year, Grand Met set about expanding Burger King's operations in Europe by acquiring UK-based United Biscuits restaurant operations, including the nearly 400-location burger chain Wimpy. With the purchase, described as a [...] "rare opportunity" [...] by CEO Sheppard, Grand Met set about converting certain Wimpy locations that employed a counter service system into Burger King locations. The merger of the United Biscuits properties with BK grew the company from about 30 restaurants in the UK to more than 60 within a year of the purchase, with another 30 locations added in early 1990. While other [...] "Wimpy" [...] locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

2500|$|During winter, {{manatees}} often congregate {{near the}} warm-water outflows of power plants {{along the coast}} of Florida instead of migrating south as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did.</b> [...] Some conservationists are concerned that these manatees have become too reliant on these artificially warmed areas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to find a new way to heat the water for manatees that are dependent on plants that have closed. The main water treatment plant in Guyana has four manatees that keep storage canals clear of weeds; there are also some in the ponds of the national park in Georgetown, Guyana.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{sequel to}} Gamesmanship, was {{published}} in 1958 under the title of Supermanship. Its publisher, Rupert Hart-Davis, privately wrote of the book, [...] "Gamesmanship made me laugh a lot, and its two successors were just good enough (all three still sell prodigiously), but the world has moved (deathwards, you may say) {{in the last ten}} years, and Potter hasn't budged an inch. In truth the joke is played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as <b>they</b> <b>once</b> <b>did,</b> possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E
