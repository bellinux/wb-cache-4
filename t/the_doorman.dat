5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase. Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. <b>The</b> <b>doorman</b> in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz—the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present—briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were embassy staff—predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer tasked with guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.|$|E

Two new puppeteers, Brian Muehl and Karen Prell joined the troupe of Muppeteers during this series, and also Betsy Baytos was auditioned to perform in eight episodes during this season.|$|E
25|$|Within {{hours of}} Cahill's murder, the Provisional IRA claimed {{responsibility}} {{in a press}} release. The reasons cited were Cahill's alleged involvement with a Portadown unit of the Ulster Volunteer Force. The unit in question had attempted a bomb attack on a south Dublin pub which was hosting a Sinn Féin fund-raiser on 21 May 1994. The UVF operatives were halted by <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> Martin Doherty. In the ensuing struggle Doherty, who the IRA subsequently announced was a volunteer in their Dublin Brigade, was shot dead. The Provisionals further alleged that Cahill {{had been involved in}} selling the stolen Beit paintings to the UVF gang led by Billy Wright. The UVF then fenced the paintings for money, which they used to buy guns from South Africa. This act supposedly sealed Cahill's fate, and put him at the top of an IRA hit list. In a later statement, the IRA said that it was Cahill's involvement with and assistance to pro-British death squads which forced us to act.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{were due}} to perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961, not far from Epstein's NEMS store. Epstein asked Harry to arrange for him and Taylor to watch the Beatles perform without queuing at the door. Harry phoned the owner, Ray McFall, who said he would inform <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> on the day, Delaney, to let Epstein in.

500|$|From the {{physical}} {{layout of the}} club, as described by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column, the Stork should have been doomed to failure, since it was strangely shaped and far from roomy in places. The club's ladies' room was {{on the second floor}} of the structure and the men's room was on the third; only the dining room, bar, and later the Cub Room were on the first floor. Despite this, the club could hold 1,000 guests. A feature of the club was a solid 14-karat gold chain at its entrance; patrons were allowed entry through it by <b>the</b> <b>doorman.</b> When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park, one of the artifacts found in it was a still. [...] The New York Historical Society displayed that along with other Stork Club items and memorabilia in an exhibit in 2000.|$|E
500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon." ...|$|E

500|$|The hotel also {{suffered}} a blow upon {{the death of}} King Edward in 1910, when 38 planned dinners and functions were cancelled, but began to prosper the following year, made fashionable by the Prince of Wales who regularly dined here. King Edward was particularly fond of the cakes made at the Ritz. [...] The hotel would regularly send him a supply, but this was kept in confidence as the King's chef may not have wanted it known that food he did not prepare was served at Buckingham Palace. Ritz retained control {{of much of the}} hotel's operation for many years. He hired world-famous chef Auguste Escoffier to provide cuisine to match the opulence of the hotel's decorations; he placed a special bell in the entryway by which <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> could notify the staff of the impending arrival of royalty. By 1929 the hotel was still being praised for its architecture; Professor Charles Reilly wrote about the Ritz in Building magazine in 1929, calling it the [...] "finest modern structure" [...] in the street, with [...] "an elegance of general form".|$|E
500|$|Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 {{were greeted}} by a bouncer who {{inspected}} them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called [...] "Lily Law", [...] "Alice Blue Gown", or [...] "Betty Badge"), visitors {{would have to be}} known by <b>the</b> <b>doorman,</b> or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private [...] "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by [...] "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go. Only a few transvestites, or men in full drag, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were [...] "98 percent male" [...] but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as [...] "the gay bar in the city".|$|E

50|$|Twin {{statues of}} Danav and Manav are located beside the main shrine. The statues are its dwarpals (doormen).

When someone was dying or had just died, an appearance in front of these statues, returns them briefly to life before finally expiring. The power of Manav kept the person alive, while Danav took the person's soul to Lord Vishnu's abode.|$|R

2500|$|On May 2, 1957, Vito Genovese ordered Gigante {{to murder}} Genovese family Boss Frank Costello, {{a close friend}} and {{successor}} of Lucky Luciano the best-known underworld figure in the United States.

Just as Gigante fired his [...]38-caliber handgun, Costello moved, causing the bullet to graze {{the right side of his}} head. Because Costello fell down, Gigante thought the mob boss was dead and sped away in a black Cadillac. Costello refused to identify his attempted assassin, leading Gigante to thank Costello in court, but <b>the</b> <b>doorman</b> at 115 Central Park West did. When tried for the shooting, his defense team effectively challenged the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>doorman,</b> and Gigante was acquitted in 1958 on charges of attempted murder.|$|E
