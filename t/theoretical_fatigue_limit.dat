40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{intrinsic}} S-N curve was proposed. Then influencing factors caused by manufacture were introduced based on fatigue life double-parameter {{model and the}} effects of influencing factors caused by manufacture on S-N curve were discussed. GH 4149 was employed to obtain S-N curves with different stress concentrations. The specimens had three surface states resulting from different manufacturing processes which are traditional machining process, machining process with surface integrity and advanced surface strengthening technology. The sensitivity of fatigue resistance coefficient(M f) and <b>theoretical</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> (S c) to K t was analyzed. The results show that the fatigue properties of the smooth specimens and notched specimens both are improved after surface strengthening. When the stress concentration is relatively low, the increase of fatigue resistance coefficient(M f) plays more important role for the improvement of fatigue life after surface strengthening. Nevertheless, the improvement of <b>theoretical</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> (S c) becomes more and more important with the increase of K t. Moreover,it is helpful to analyze the changes of S-N curve using influencing factors caused by manufacture for deepening the understanding of anti-fatigue manufacture...|$|E

A simple {{application of the}} model to determining fatigue (pitting) life of thrust and radial ball bearings is given. Bearing fatigue life besides the normal stress also depends on the residual and frictional stresses. It {{is a function of}} the maximum contact pressure, a certain combination of the normal, frictional and residual stresses as well as of the average initial defect size. More specifically, fatigue life is inverse proportional to a positive power of the maximum contact pressure and of the average initial defect size. The above power is directly related to a material fatigue resistance parameter. For a high enough compressive residual stress the fatigue life distribution exhibits the appearance of a <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> However, under the same operating conditions the same material for low compressive and tensile residual stress does not present the appearance of a <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> A qualitative comparison of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>fatigue</b> data with the test fatigue life data obtained for tapered bearings is presented...|$|R

Scatter characteristics of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength for magnesium alloy were investigated in this study. At least 20 specimens were tested to obtain the scatter data of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. The probability distributions of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength were evaluated by using Normal distribution and Weibull distribution function. The values of the Weibull modulus, m were 159, 10, 175 for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that scatter of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is small and almost coincides with that of tensile strength, while scatter of fatigue life is significantly large compared to those of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and tensile strength. The large scatter of fatigue life will be due to crack nucleation and small crack growth processes, which strongly depend on local microstructure near the crack nucleation region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh end {{applications}} {{often require}} high strength materials especially regarding the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> It {{is still an}} open question what the highest <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> are and how to increase them further in high strength steels. A thermomechanical treatment (TMT) in the temperature range of maximal dynamic strain ageing is an auspicious way to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of bearing steel SAE 52100. Successful attempts have been published for various materials states. The present investigation deals with the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and the possibility to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by TMT. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels increases by reducing {{the size of the}} non-metallic inclusions during steelmaking. We found that TMT increases the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of a high strength materials state only in cases in which the non-metallic inclusions are the starting points of the fatigue cracks. In the case of high cleanliness of the steel the origin of the fatigue cracks may be at any position in the matrix. If there are no critical non-metallic inclusions a TMT did not increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> further. The reasons for this behaviour will be explained and the border of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{achieve a}} high <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> {{the most common}} {{approach}} {{is to increase the}} static strength and hardness of a material. This is realized mostly by decreasing microstructural dimensions as the grain size or the spacing between phases in more phase materials. According to the Hall-Petch-relationship the static strength is increased by that way. Simultaneously, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> which is defined by the non-propagation of cracks, increases with decreasing microstructural dimensions. The reason is that microstructurally small cracks are stopped at microstructural barriers so that smaller distances between neighboring barriers reduce the length of non-propagating cracks and increase the intrinsic <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> But this increase of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is confined by the dimensions of the flaws within the material, such as non-metallic inclusions or geometrical notches, which reduce the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength materials significantly. The trade-off between small microstructural dimensions and the dimensions of the flaws will be discussed on the basis of experimental results in three examples. Firstly, commercial pure titanium shows a distinct change of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> not before the notches are larger than the grain sizes, although the stress intensity at the notches is significant [1]. Secondly, micro notches in high strength materials always result in a huge decrease of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [2]. Thirdly, as bulk metallic glasses do not possess microstructural barriers like grain boundaries notches are a crucial factor in this class of materials [3]. On the basis of these examples and the modified Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram [4] a new approach to explain the microstructure and notch influence on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> will be presented. This could be the basis for future developments to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of metals...|$|R

Twelve <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> were determined based on S-N curves obtained {{according to the}} standard fatigue test methods. The scatter of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the die-cast AM 60 B was large compared to the extruded AZ 61 : the values of Weibull modulus and COV were 16 and 6. 8, respectively, for the die-cast material, whereas those for the extruded one were 159 and 0. 7. The COV value of 0. 7 for the extruded AZ 61 meant that only 0. 7 % of scatter from the mean value {{was included in the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> determined based on the S- N curve. This COV value was comparable to that of 0. 6 for the tensile strength of the same material.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the effect of defect {{orientation}} on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of three types of steels; JIS-S 15 C, JIS-S 45 C and JIS-SNCM 439, a small semi-circular slit was introduced into {{the surface of a}} round specimen. The slits were tilted at 0 ∘, 30 ∘ or 60 ∘ with respect to the plane normal to the loading axis, but all of them had the same defect size, a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF = 188 [*]μm, where the area denotes the area of the domain defined by projecting the defect on a plane normal to the loading axis. In all the combinations of the materials and tilting angles, a non-propagating crack was found at the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> i. e. the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was determined by the non-propagation condition of crack initiated from the defect. In JIS-S 15 C and JIS-S 45 C, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was nearly independent of the tilting angle, which was in good agreement with the predicted value by the a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF parameter model.

40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of shot peening {{in order to increase}} the bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the shot peening were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the shot peening media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. Shot peening and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a cryotreatment. The shot peening of these gears {{was performed}} by dual shot peening using media of two different hardness. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is enhanced when the shot peening was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for samples shot peened with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation.

Then, bending fatigue tests were conducted on the specimens. 【Findings】–The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was improved by SP and SSP. In the case of SP and SSP specimens, the specimens with a semi‐circular slit under a= 0. 2 [*]mm fractured outside the slit, and they had considerably high <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore, a semi‐circular slit with a depth of under a= 0. 2 [*]mm could be rendered harmless by SP or SSP.

40|$|Fatigue is an {{irreversible}} process, {{accompanied by}} microstructural changes, localized plastic strains and energy dissipation. The temperature increase of a metallic material undergoing a fatigue test is {{a manifestation of}} the thermal energy dissipation and it was experimentally observed that the higher the applied stress amplitude the more pronounced the temperature increase of the material. Moreover, the trend of the observed temperature increase versus the applied stress amplitude presents a more or less abrupt positive change at a certain stress level. This characteristic stress amplitude was associated to the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [1 - 7]. Since the load-increasing tests are fast and a single specimens can be used to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> Risitano and co-workers set-up a rapid experimental methodology to determine the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> based on load-increasing tests monitored with an infrared camera, according to the so-called Risitano method [5]. It is known that due to plasticity, the stress amplitude and the material temperature waves present a phase shift. Therefore, taking advantage of the lock-in thermography, temperature oscillations due to dissipated energy, T 2, can be obtained as the component having double frequency of the load signal sine wave by using the classical Fourier analysis, as suggest by Krapez et al [8]. They proposed to use T 2, instead of the stabilized material temperature measured during a fatigue test in order to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> However, they noticed that the applicability of the method depends on the material under analysis. In particular, satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 1050 steel and AISI 316 L stainless steel, while the approach was useless while investigating the fatigue behavior of 7010 aluminum alloy, since temperature signal associated with the dissipated energy was very weak in relation to the available experimental equipment. Aaki et al [9] proposed to use the dissipated energy, evaluated by using the lock-in thermography, to assess the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> They pointed out that satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 316 L, while in the case of AISI 304 the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimated by dissipated energy measurements provided a conservative value as compared to that evaluated by means of conventional fatigue test. The phase shift angle was proposed as a suitable damage index for the rapid determination of material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by Shiozawa et al [10]. They validated the approach against experimental results obtained from AISI 306 L stainless steel specimens and noticed a satisfactory agreement with the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> determined by the conventional stair-case tests. Recently, Shiozawa et al [11] proposed a new experimental technique for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimation based on the phase 2 f lock-in infrared method, where a single fatigue test was performed on AISI 316 steel specimens by increasing the applied stress amplitude, a, and by measuring the in-creasing rate of the dissipated energy, dq/da. By plotting dq/da versus a, an abrupt increase is seen when a exceeds the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> Meneghetti [12] proposed an experimental technique for the direct evaluation of the heat energy density per cycle dissipated by a material undergoing a fatigue tests (the Q parameter). Q can be easily evaluated by stopping the fatigue test at t = t* after thermal equilibrium has been reached and by measuring the cooling gradient immediately after t*. Originally adopted to rationalise the notch effect in finite-life fatigue of stainless steel specimens [13], it is envisaged that the specific heat loss Q may be used also to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> This paper analyses all previous thermal methods for the rapid experimental estimation of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> In particular, the rapid engineering techniques proposed by La Rosa and Risitano [5], by Shiozawa et al [10] as well as by using the Q parameter [12] will be applied to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of cold-drawn AISI 304 L stainless steel bars and critical issues in practical applications of the analysed techniques will be singled out...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of lamellar pearlitic steel used for railroad rails, tensile tests and fatigue tests are performed. Although the fatigue ratio of the lamellar pearlitic steel is {{lower than that of}} general steels, the reason for this has not been clarified. The fatigue cracks of the pearlitic steel initiate at a very early stage during the fatigue test. It is speculated that the steel should be treated as a steel with initial defects. In order to determine the initial defect size of the ultra-low cycle fatigue test, tensile tests are performed. Based on the test results, it was clarified that the crack initiation size depends on the crystal structure. In order to predict the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel, Murakami's prediction method is applied to the steel. The measured defect sizes are applied to the method, and the fatigue tests are performed. The predicted <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> and the test results have good agreement. In addition, from the SEM observations, the initial crack causing the fatigue failure was found to be a pearlite block. We then concluded that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel can be predicted by Murakami's method and the defect size is the pearlite block size. If the pearlite block sizes then become small, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel will increase...|$|R
