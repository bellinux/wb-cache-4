[...] Cisneros told the San Antonio Express-News: [...] "There are efforts under way to eliminate important national efforts which provide shelter and assistance to millions of low-income Americans.

Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies.

Well," [...] she said at last, [...] "I don't feel so anxious about myself, just at present, as I do about Flavia. I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for Flavia, Mrs. Halleck. I want her to be christened,--I want her to be baptized into some church. I think a good deal about it.

5000|$|After being {{sworn in}} on 2 April, Sall {{appointed}} Abdoul Mbaye as prime minister.

In England in the Civil War the people of the towns almost all thought one way, and almost all those of the counties the other, and even now opinions differ almost as widely as to which was right. I hate to hear people always laying down the law as if there could not possibly be two sides to the case, and as if everyone who differed from them must be a rascal and a traitor. Almost all the fellows I know say that if it comes to fighting they shall go into the State army, and I should be quite willing, if they would really take fellows of my age for soldiers, to enlist too; but that is no reason why one should not get sick of hearing nothing but one subject talked of for weeks." ...|$|E
