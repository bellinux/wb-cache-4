40|$|The paper {{considers}} the interdisciplinary interaction {{of research on}} the cognitive aspects of translation. Examples of influence from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, reading and writing research and language technology are given, with examples from specific sub-disciplines within each one. The breadth of borrowing by researchers in cognitive <b>translatology</b> is made apparent, but the minimal influence of cognitive <b>translatology</b> on the respective disciplines themselves is also highlighted. Suggestions for future developments are made, including ways in which the domain of cognitive <b>translatology</b> might exert greater influence on other disciplines...|$|E
40|$|Researches on the {{previous}} styles of conducting literary comparative studies {{on the one hand}} and on the essentialist source-oriented <b>translatology</b> on the other demonstrate their incommensurability with literary theory discourse and its critical conceptual apparatus. Any interference of their languages representing diverse methodological options has long been precluded. The article includes a brief survey of the historical development and mutual relationships between successive methodological approaches within comparative literature and <b>translatology,</b> from the split between the positivist philology of influences and dependences and hermeneutic translational thought to their final reunion in the culture-oriented Translation Studies of the 1990 s. The references to the main trends of the 20 th century <b>translatology</b> are supported by their concise characteristics.

40|$|When {{summing up}} {{the history of}} <b>translatology</b> {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century, the author points to undoubtful {{achievements}} of this discipline as well as disputable questions and tasks for the future. She proves that the postmodern conceptions of the exhaustion of literature (Lyotard) are not reflected in studies of translation. Just the opposite, this field has been developing dynamically, although its autonomy is still questioned. The chance of <b>translatology</b> is its interdisciplinary character, relation with methodology of linguistic studies, using the theory of interpretation and the theory of intertextuality. Some of the questions which are disputed are: equivalentisation, non-translatability, opposition of archaisation and modernisation. In the sphere of postulates is the synthesis of Polish knowledge on translation, Formation of proper criticism of translation and codification of terminology. All these motifs of considerations are supported by references to the most important conceptions and trends of the 20 th century <b>translatology...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} stage of <b>translatology</b> {{development}} we witness a collision of two approaches to translation: the text-focused approach and the communicative-functional approach. This paper offers arguments {{in defense of}} the communicative-functional approach and proves that this approach is a convenient tool of revealing the intrinsic nature of translation as a human activity. It is instrumental in solving traditional problems of <b>translatology,</b> including the problem of translation quality assessment. Translation quality is assessed in terms of adequacy defined as the conformity of the target text to the translation goal and the purposes of the activities performed by the communication actors...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} first {{talk about the}} history, production, and {{importance}} of the dictionaries. Dictionaries {{play an important role}} in developing the social culture so it is quite necessary and reasonable to take them as a kind of research subject. Lexicography, which is generally considered to be built on modern linguistics, must possess its own theoretical system and research methodology. In terms of the properties of lexicography, the paper will discuss such aspects as multidisciplinary integration, open perspectives, and practice orientation. Any new perspective to deal with the dictionary may be possible or feasible on condition that it satisfies the requirements of lexicography. With the development of <b>translatology</b> and lexicography, the translatological dictionaries (TD) came into being.

40|$|AbstractTranslation of phraseological units is topical for the {{contemporary}} <b>translatology</b> nowadays. According to many outstanding specialists, phraseological units are lexical combinations, {{the meaning of}} which {{is defined by the}} whole expression. The most distinctive feature of phraseological unit is its emotional expressiveness and conciseness of thought expression. Fairly often, phraseological units are functioning in the newspaper style. It should be noted that phraseological units are very often transformed into “stock phrases”. Defining phraseological units in the text and the ability to find an equivalent to it during the translation process is the most important stage for the translat or. In order to translate a phraseological unit, the translator should use phraseological dictionaries and context plays an important role during the translation process. In conclusion {{it should be noted that}} phraseological units reflect culture and a national mentality of a definite nation. Due to this reason, translation of phraseological units is one of the topical issues for {{the contemporary}} <b>translatology.</b> Phraseological units are an integral part of any language or culture and knowing these units and appropriate interpretation of them is an evidence of appropriate translation of the whole expression or a work of art...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the case}} of Bulgarian {{literature}} in France, Vrinat-Nikolov suggests that forming a general stereotype of the source-culture within the target-culture may be productive. She also argues for adopting a “foreignising” (L. Venuti), yet not “exoticising” strategy of translation, and implicitly links this <b>translatology</b> issue to the culturological concept of ‘self-colonisation’. Promoting Bulgarian literature abroad should rely on {{the cumulative effect of}} efforts by the different agents of the Bulgarian literary field, beginning with a translational strategy focused on recreating a poetics (after H. Meschonnic), which could enhance the appeal even of a literature as unappealing as Bulgarian literature in France...|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} a {{descriptive}} theoretical study which aims at mapping Min'jar- Beloruchev's {{work in the}} context of contemporary and modern theories and presenting a comprehensive view of author's note-taking system for consecutive interpreting. The analysis of the system forms the crux of this thesis, which focuses on sources that represent the basis of the system, individual features of the system as well as factors that influenced his decisions while working on the system. Other parts of the thesis focuse on a consecutive interpreting training system, that was developed by the author, and to some extent deal with his views on <b>translatology</b> as a science and the interpreting process itself...|$|E

It regroups {{knowledge about the}} creativity in different fields, mainly in psychology, and presents the actual state of the research of creativity in <b>translatology.</b> It brings out the similarity of interpreting with improvisation and art, which are both highly creative. On {{the basis of the}} existing models of process of interpreting, it proposes an empirical study of the product of interpreting, using language transformations, with the aim to prove that simultaneous interpreting is a creative activity on more levels (lexical, syntactical and semantic). This experiment was not convincing on a lexical level, but in general it helped to confirm that interpreters are creative during simultaneous interpreting...|$|E
40|$|The {{questions}} of a translation unit, its dimensions and natural features have absorbed the traductologists since {{the origins of}} <b>translatology.</b> According to this, {{the primary purpose of}} this paper is to establish the range of the most important defining propositions and further to consider the issue, whether a translation unit should be in fact understood as a word, a phrase, a sentence, a text, culture or a variable entity. The approach will put forward the claim that it is necessary to differentiate between the unit of translation and the unit of translating, and that the appropriate text type particularly determines the dimensions of the unit of translating.

40|$|The {{translator}} {{should not}} {{be perceived as a}} simple producer of texts based on other texts, but as an expert, with skills, tasks and precise responsibilities, who works in cooperation with other "actors", {{that are part of the}} translating process. Text translating is not a simple linguistic act, but a complex one, that involves Linguistics, Hermeneutics (because texts must be interpreted) and Semiology (because signs and symbols must be decoded). In this paper is being explained the difference between translation studies (or <b>translatology)</b> and the linguistic theory of translation and why translatological concepts like “purpose”, “adequacy” and “actor” (as they were defined by Reiß, Vermeer and Mänttäri) are essential and necessary required for a complete description and a responsible fulfillment of translating acts...|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} Sprawiedliwość na końcu języka. Czytanie Waltera Benjamina by Adam Lipszyc locates {{the book in}} the {{framework}} of a wider phenomenon of interest in Walter Benjamin’s writings in contemporary Polish humanities. Author of the review indicates the basic assumption of homogeneity of the Benjamin’s writings, involving continuous elaboration of the “justice act” formula. The resulting preference for theological perspective, which becomes axiological frame for the analysis contained in the book, is questionable to reviewer. Despite these methodological concerns, the review underlines the impressive character of the analyzes conducted by Lipszyc, including not only a detailed reconstruction of Benjamin’s thought, but also the broader context of the philosophy of the twentieth century. The most important idea for literary studies {{turns out to be a}} dialectical relationship between philosophy and literature (criticism, history, <b>translatology),</b> which is being introduced by Lipszyc following Benjamin’s work...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study to investigate the impact of subtitles on the processing of audiovisual texts in terms of levels of self-reported engagement with the text. It also presents a methodology for investigating the neural processing of subtitles using electroencephalography (EEG) and psychometrics. By establishing the beta coherence between prefrontal and posterior regions, we can determine whether the effect of subtitles can be captured through EEG, and how this is related to psychological immersion. We therefore use EEG to investigate the cognitive processing of subtitled film in combination with subjective psychometrics. Initial validation of this methodology shows that adding same language subtitles results in statistically significantly higher levels of immersion and enjoyment, lending support to a view that subtitles facilitate (dis) embodied cognition. We propose these as the first steps towards a cognitive audiovisual <b>translatology...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to compare}} two Czech {{translations}} of John Steinbeck's novel Tortilla flat considering {{the theories of}} acknowledged translatologists (Levý, Knittlová, Krijtová). For Steinbeck's work differentiation of the language used in direct speech from the language used by the narrator by using colloquial and slang expressions is characteristic, so Steinbeck's translators were to cope with an uneasy task to find a functional equivalent of the different language layers in the target language. The thesis focuses among other on {{the means by which}} the differentiation was reached by two different translators considering the development of functional aspect in Czech <b>translatology.</b> A very significant element in Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat is the aim to outline the local atmosphere by using local names, facts and not translated Spanish expressions, which needs to be transferred to the target language considering the requirement both to preserve the local atmosphere in the translation and to create a translation, which is a valuable and understandable piece of literature in the target language...|$|E
40|$|This article {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to the special issue of Perspectives: Studies in <b>Translatology</b> entitled ‘Corpus linguistics and Audiovisual Translation: in search of an integrated approach’. The purpose of the volume is to illustrate and discuss the use and limits (if any) of corpus-based investigation into audiovisual dialogue and audiovisual translation. This special issue also seeks to investigate the development of corpus-based approaches to AVT that are able {{to take into account the}} multiple dimensions of audiovisual translation, the technical and professional constraints that are specific to the medium, as well as the social factors affecting the translational act (e. g. target language and culture norms, self-censorship, patronage, etc.). This is achieved through seven contributions, intended to offer a wide range of perspectives on the application of corpus linguistics methodologies to different AVT modalities. As the contributions in this volume suggest, an integrated approach is needed to account for the complex semiotic fabric of audiovisual texts, their hybrid nature and multiple codes...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} comprised of two parts - the translation and the commentary on it. The first part is the translation of the original book by Paul Johnson The Little People of the British Isles, describing different species of the little people of the territory. The translation contains the main text {{of the book and}} selected sections of the glossary relevant to the text. The commentary part includes a translation analysis of the source text, an analysis of translation problems, and a typology of translation shifts. The analysis is based on Christiane Nord's model of intratextual and extratextual factors. The following part is focused on problems, shifts, and a <b>translatology</b> method, mainly employing the schemes by Jiří Levý and Anton Popovič. Furthermore, other books on translation studies were used as secondary sources for the thesis. Commented problems and shifts are demonstrated on illustrative examples.

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the set of items: {{teaching}} translation, objectives, exercises and assignments (both word-centered and text-centered translation), translation analysis. The choice of the items is motivated by the dominant functions of transatology (nominative and communicative). The latter succeed in identification of adequate, congruent, equivalent translation. The article discusses the problems of professional validity, theoretical insertions, textocentric analysis. Gains, achievements, goals and perspective vistas are the highlights herein. The ways of translation adaptation have been outlined, among them are conceptualization, de-focusing, redundancy (language economy). The rendering of the original texts into target ones brings the diversity of the exercises and assignments what is the focus centre of the paper. The paper gives an opportunity to make translation analyses of the original and target texts. Semantic isotopy, textual non-linearity, self-organization, rhisomatic way of arranging textual cohesion and coherence, ramified architectonics and interpretation plurality remain actual, urgent, still unsolved problems in <b>translatology.</b> The major principles are manifested in conceptualization, de-focusing, expanse, redundancy (language economy) specific arrangement...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{presents}} a contrastive description of reporting clauses in present-day original Czech and American fiction (published and awarded in 2010 - 2015). The examined reported clauses {{are limited to}} direct speech marked with a conventional means of punctuation. Based on six samples of fiction, three American ones and three Czech ones, this thesis examines reporting verbs, their diversity, {{the nature of the}} subject of reporting clauses, modification by adjuncts, the presence of an object expressing the addressee and the position of reporting clauses with respect to their reported clauses. It also scrutinizes the instances of leaving the reporting clause unexpressed and of certain transient forms. The ascertained values are then compared with a <b>translatology</b> paper on the same topic. The findings of this thesis confirm that while Czech reporting clauses strive for diversity by a number of means, English reporting clauses strive for inconspicuousness. This thesis attempts to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} reporting clauses. The outlined findings may be helpful especially to translators and fiction writers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to a {{relatively}} little explored issue - the social differentiation of literary characters and the transfer of its linguistic means. The language material for exploring this field of <b>translatology</b> was provided by Döblin's novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1928) and by two translations into Czech (1935 and 1968). We analyzed utterances of two characters. The first one represents a lower social class and criminal environment. In his speech the analysis showed many elements of Berlin urbanolect which were used for his social characterization. The second character represents the Jewish ethnic group. His direct speech contains elements of literary Yiddish, alluding to his Jewish origins. The subsequent utterance analysis of the first character in Czech translations showed an appropriate use of common Czech {{as a substitute for}} Berlin urbanolect in both translations. The analysis was set in the context where the usage of nonstandard elements in Czech and translated literature used to be a convention. Both translators followed these conventions successfully. When translating the literary Yiddish in the direct speech of the second character, significant differences in both translations were discovered. In the first translation the Yiddish elements were not replaced. In the second [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of current discussions about gender and {{feminism}} this works tries to look deeper into the question of gender in <b>translatology</b> where gender in particular takes on the double role - {{on the one hand}} the role of grammatical gender in its linguistic form and on the other the role of social gender construction with regards to the person who translates. The aim of this work apart from the theoretical insight in the connected domains is mainly to assemble a concise overview of translations from French written by the Czech female translators {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century. Additionally, the work also treats the question of Czech emancipation movement and contributes at least with basic biographical information to the knowledge of mentioned female translators. The acquired data for the overview of translations from French were assembled in the form of bibliographical index which reflects both translations published as books and in the periodical press for each of the female translators. The results of this work allow to consider one chapter of Czech history translation from the "female point of view" and at the same time might serve as a basis for further research in this field...|$|E
40|$|In this diploma thesis I {{concerned}} {{myself with}} translations of Dutch horticultural texts into Czech language, both professional and popular-science texts, as wel as legislative and pragmatic. The aim of my thesis was to analyse {{different kinds of}} horticultural texts from translatological {{point of view and}} to find out some problematic phenomena, which arise by the reception and translation of these texts. I concentrated also on relations of equivalence between Dutch, Latin and Czech terminology by the names of plants, writing of the scientific names and evaluation of selected texts in terms of text linguistics. First chapter is devoted to teoretical parts of linguistics and <b>translatology</b> related to this problematic and it is mainly based on research of literary sources. Further I concerned myself with some translatological problems, which a translator meets in the area of professional and popular-science literature. First of them was the problem of nomanclatural names, individual botanical categories and rules for writing of the names of plants. From comparison of plant names in expert publications arised that the way of writing of these names is in both languages same and according to the international rules. By the botanical names I compared also on the example of assortment of spring bulbs the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{helped develop}} {{guidelines}} for modifying the current curriculum {{of the existing}} B. A. in English Translation within Iranian universities. Participants were 30 experts {{in the fields of}} English language translation, linguistics, and <b>translatology</b> from four Iranian universities. Using the Delphi research methodology, researchers administered two rounds of questionnaires that focused on skills needed to help trainees adapt themselves to new changes in the field, strategies for applying these skills, and methods of promoting motivation among translator trainees. Results suggested that the Iranian B. A. translation program needed substantive changes in the skills, techniques, and contents it covered, strategies used to teach the skills, and learners ' motivation. Suggestions included designing courses so that trainees could achieve mastery of first- and second-language proficiency; shifting from a teacher-centered to a workshop-like orientation; offering elective courses; helping students understand the importance of translation; and adopting a student-centered methodology.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} and explain the relatively new, but widespread phenomenon of amateur subtitling of scripted television series, and to propose a model {{that can be used}} to analyze this specific kind of translational practice in its social and technological context. For this purpose, we have adopted theoretical and methodological approaches from the disciplines of <b>translatology,</b> sociology and media studies, while highlighting the changing functions of audiovisual translation in contemporary society and the role of translational norms. Motivation for translating is explained using Bourdieu's concepts of cultural and social capital. In the empirical part, we apply the analytical model to a case study, which focuses on the on Czech amateur subtitling of the first season of the Game of Thrones television drama series. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we describe and analyze the social context, the process of the translation itself, and the reception and resulting structural features of amateur subtitles compared to the official subtitles aired by HBO. A key informant interview with the amateur translator is used to shed light on the motivations behind and the logistics of his work.

40|$|The {{shift in}} {{paradigm}} which {{gave rise to}} relativism has brought {{about a number of}} reconsiderations of the critical act [...] reconsiderations which question in a fundamental way the objectivity of the subject, the autonomy of the object of study, and the neutrality of language. Recent advances in the field of <b>translatology</b> participate in this shift in paradigm, insofar as they dismantle the discourse of transparency and restore to translators their primary role in the reception/re-enunciation of the source text. A study of the production and reception of Anne Cameron's Daughters of Copper Woman (1981) demonstrates {{the extent to which the}} translator, in choosing to take on the stakes arising from the source text, becomes responsible for her/his performed act of mediating. Furthermore, the translator must be prepared to accept the subjectivity of her/his own reading and ideological convictions, and to contest the value of invisibility traditionally attached to the translator' s role. Analysis of the translations of the first ten short stories of Daughters of Copper Woman illustrates how the translator's ideological stance orients her translation choices. In this thesis, the translator's process of textual intervention is examined from two distinct but complementary perspectives [...] the feminist and the Bermanian...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to present some of the results arising from the {{analysis}} of Ausiàs March's poems (source text) taking {{as a starting point}} the contrast between its several English translations from the XXth century. This technique provides us with models to solve critical units of translation which are also «critical units» for the comprehension and reception of the source text. All in all, translation is the best and hardest way to prove the comprehension of literary works, even more when we are dealing with the works of an author with a difficult and sometimes brusque expression such as Ausiàs March. In this piece of work we will present some examples of the contrastive analysis of the English translation of Ausiàs March's verses containing collocations, locutions and proverbs. Besides the inherent difficulty to translate them, these verses can provide us with a model to solve problems related to the current model of the standard Catalan language. Therefore, this is an interdisciplinary research that combines both elements of history of literature, of translation and of <b>translatology</b> (to check and prove the several techniques and translation criteria of English translators of Ausiàs March), and also elements of linguistics applied to discourse analysis (locutions, collocations and proverbs) ...|$|E
