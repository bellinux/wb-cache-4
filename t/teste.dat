5|$|Commandant <b>Teste</b> was {{designed}} to accommodate the naval version of the Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were obsolete when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July–August 1934. The Latécoère 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March–May 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until the folding wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933. They were replaced in turn by the improved Gourdou-Leseurre GL-813 in early 1936. The larger Loire 130 flying boat replaced the GL-813 from April 1938, although the catapults had to be modified to handle their greater weight. No fighter seaplanes were ever embarked on Commandant <b>Teste,</b> although the Loire 210 floatplane {{was designed}} for the role. However, {{it proved to be}} greatly out-classed by contemporary land-based fighters and only 20 were built in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{decision}} to convert Béarn into an aircraft carrier was made, the French Navy decided to construct a mocked-up flight deck on the unfinished hull after it was launched in April 1920.

These experiments convinced the Navy to convert Béarn as a semi-experimental ship, which should be replaced by purpose-built aircraft carriers as soon as was practicable. The , ordered in the late 1930s, were nevertheless not completed. In the meantime, Béarn was commissioned for sea trials that began on 1 September 1926, and couple with final fitting-out work, lasted to May 1928, when she joined the French fleet on active service. In the late 1920s, André Jubelin, a future admiral and pioneer of the French naval air force, served aboard the ship.

40|$|PURPOSE—To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} laparoscopy {{in the management of}} the impalpable testis.  DESIGN—A retrospective analysis of the clinical findings, interventions, and outcome in 87 consecutive boys undergoing laparoscopy for 97 impalpable <b>testes.</b>  RESULTS—Fifty seven <b>testes</b> were either absent (n = 35) or present as a small remnant (n = 22), which was removed at contemporaneous groin exploration. There were 27 intra-abdominal <b>testes,</b> including four hypoplastic <b>testes,</b> which were removed laparoscopically. The 13 remaining viable <b>testes</b> were located in the groin. Conventional orchidopexy followed laparoscopy for 21 <b>testes,</b> and was successful in 17 cases.

40|$|Background/Purpose : To {{assess the}} outcome of the primary laparoscopy-assisted orchiopexy (LAO) and the laparoscopic {{two-stage}} Fowler Stephens orchiopexy (FSO) for managing patients with nonpalpable testis in terms of safety, feasibility and efficacy. Materials and Methods: This study included 94 patients (110 nonpalpable <b>testes)</b> who underwent laparoscopy at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh between July 1998 and June 2012. Patients were evaluated postoperatively to check the location and size of <b>testes</b> and to exclude any other complications. Results: Mean age at presentation was 24 +/− 19 months (9 - 96 months). Orchiectomy was done for 5 atrophic <b>testes.</b> 36 open orchiopexy was done for 29 canalicular <b>testes</b> and 7 peeping <b>testes.</b> 35 LAO were done for 1 canalicular testis, 5 peeping <b>testes,</b> 16 low intraabdominal <b>testes</b> and 13 high intraabdominal <b>testes.</b> 34 FSO were done for 23 high intraabdominal <b>testes,</b> 9 low intraabdominal <b>testes</b> and 2 peeping <b>testes.</b> Median follow up was 12 months (1 - 84 months) and 6 patients were lost to follow up. The overall success rates for LAO and FSO were 88 % and 63 %, respectively. Overall testicular atrophy rates were 3 % and 30 % for LAO and FSO, respectively (OR 0. 08 [95 % CI, 0. 01 - 0. 69], P = 0. 006). For high intraabdominal <b>testes,</b> the atrophy rates were 3 % and 20 % for LAO and FSO, respectively (OR 0. 14 [95 % CI, 0. 02 - 1. 21, P = 0. 049). Testicular displacement rates were 9 % and 7 % for LAO and FSO, respectively (OR 1. 5, 95 % CI, 0. 24 - 9. 59, P = 0. 514).
