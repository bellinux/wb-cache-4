5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.

Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles.

Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E

25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained {{more access to}} employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, women are more likely <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.|$|E

25|$|The Kintetsu and Orix merger {{plan was}} {{finalized}} in late August {{when the two}} teams signed a formal contract.

The suit was filed by the JPBPA head Atsuya Furuta as well as Koichi Isobe and Takashi Miwa, who represented the players of Kintetsu and Orix, respectively. The association decided to take legal action after NPB officials either turned down or ignored a series of demands made by the JPBPA. These demands included establishing a special committee to handle contractual issues for the players affected by the merger, including club management and players’ representatives in any decision-making processes of such a committee, and to postpone the merger {{for at least one}} year to reassess its advisability. The documents filed with the court outlined the association's demands to establish a special committee that would meet and adopt resolutions before any decisions were made and to allow the JPBPA to conduct collective negotiations on a range of merger-related issues, as a large number of players would be expected <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> should the merger go through.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers {{do not need to}} disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

50|$|In the European Commission's approach, {{flexicurity}} {{is about}} striking {{the right balance}} between flexible job arrangements and secure transitions between jobs, so that more and better jobs can be created.

Flexibility is about developing flexible work organisations where people can combine their work and private responsibilities; where they can keep their training up-to-date; and where they can potentially have flexible working hours. It is also about giving both employers and employees a more flexible environment for changing jobs.

We use social capital theory and techniques developed in social network analysis to measure the analyst’s level of connectedness and investigate whether these connections provide any information advantage to the analyst. We find that better-connected (better-networked) analysts make more accurate, timely, and bold forecasts. Moreover, analysts with better network positions are less likely <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> suggesting that these analysts are more valuable to their brokerage houses.

30|$|In this framework, {{we focus}} on the {{interaction}} between the Italian labour market and welfare characteristics in shaping the likelihood of being persistently poor, according to households’ main earner source of income and gender, as well as the temporal evolution of the territorial dualism during the crisis. As expected, households whose main earner is a recipient of income from dependent employment show lower levels of persistent poverty, because social interventions are tailored in order to protect (part of) them: they are less likely <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> and, if they do, they may be eligible to receive some unemployment insurance. In contrast, self-employed and retirees face worse economic conditions. The former cannot rely on ad hoc policies in case of job loss, earning decrease, or reduced economic activity; the latter mostly receive lower and stagnant retirement benefits. When the main earner is a woman, the household is more likely persistently poor because women traditionally play a secondary economic role in Italy.|$|R
