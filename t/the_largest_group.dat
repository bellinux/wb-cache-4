5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations.

40|$|This thesis argues the {{importance}} of the quality of relation between the individual and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group</b> in work organisations. The main thrust of this argument is that where relations between the individual and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> organisation are mutually recognising both the individual and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> organisation benefit. <b>The</b> research explores three unstructured <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> through experiences of participants. The conceptual framework underpinning the research follows system psychodynamic traditions. These traditions support in depth exploration of both conscious and unconscious aspects of group life. A multi case study design allows analysis of each of the case studies of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>groups,</b> first separately and then together. Each of the single case analyses reveals patterns of interaction that are thought about as defense against the difficulties of being in <b>the</b> particular <b>large</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> findings of the single case studies then become data for the multicase analysis. In the multicase analysis intersubjective theory is introduced. These theories, along with traditional system psychodynamic theories, allow opportunity to deeply consider the way in which individuals relate to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group,</b> and <b>the</b> impact of this relation on the formation and development of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> multicase analysis shows the difficulties group members had in asserting themselves and finding recognition in each of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> analysis also shows that despite these problems members continued to seek a recognising relation to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group.</b> This type of recognition, 'large group recognition', is distinguished from recognition found within interpersonal relations. The multicase data suggests <b>group</b> members found <b>large</b> <b>group</b> recognition through direct and representative relations to the formal authorities and through subgroup competition. However, this recognition appeared to be characterised by dynamics of domination and submission rather than by mutual recognition. In intersubjective terms this is the dialectic of the master and slave. Recognition garnered through a master slave dynamic is understood to be compromised and deplete of the self-affirming qualities of mutuality. Consequently, where <b>large</b> <b>group</b> culture and structure are characterised by, and perpetuate master slave dynamics, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and <b>the</b> individual do not function optimally. This is proposed as the circumstance in <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of this study. Specifically, it is argued that <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>groups,</b> along with tendencies towards patriarchal structure and culture, were instrumental in fostering master slave dynamics in each of the groups. To conclude the thesis the research findings are considered with respect to large work organisations. This discussion explores the value of organisational contexts informed by mutuality, most particularly as organisations face the challenges of the post industrial era...|$|R

40|$|Emergence {{of a group}} {{analytic}} {{perspective on}} <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>group</b> Group analysts tend to agree that in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> we learn about primitive defence mechanisms, the fear of psychotic fragmentation, the fragility of communication and the socially divisive and destructive potential in the foundation matrix of each culture.
