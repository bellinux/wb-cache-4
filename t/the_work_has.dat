5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> {{been widely}} admired, but also {{described}} as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised {{the book for}} helping them understand and interpret the landscape in which they lived.|$|E

5|$|In Italy, {{the written}} use of Latin had {{replaced}} Oscan—like Latin, an Italic language—and Etruscan {{by the end}} of the 1st century AD. Oscan graffiti are preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD at Pompeii, which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63. In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen antiquarian interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> not survived.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing {{it as one of}} Hergé's weakest works.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain the most from the book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably allegory, to young readers, as <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting {{the life and times}} of the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work. This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
5|$|Shastry critiqued {{the work}} Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam in the January 2003 {{issue of the}} Sanskrit monthly Bhāratī. Shastry writes that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of {{language}} {{which has not been}} seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been {{praised by}} critics {{including}} the poet and Beowulf translator Seamus Heaney. Michael D. C.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> {{developed}} a reputation as an essential one for aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. This has led to its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is {{generally considered to be}} as difficult as many other famous counterparts.|$|E

In these last two countries composer Oliver Knussen conducted. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> continued to receive international performances, for example by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, Land of the Soviets was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. As he began to redraw his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
