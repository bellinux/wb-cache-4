5|$|Several sources {{reported}} that Friedrich, his father, and his aunt were all named <b>Trump,</b> thus placing the name change before the 18th century. Genealogy organization FamilySearch provided information on Friedrich <b>Trump,</b> listing {{his father as}} Johann Ii <b>Trump.</b> A genealogist at Dotdash, which was then called About.com, listed Donald Trump's grandfather as Friederich <b>Trump</b> and great-grandfather as Christian Johannes <b>Trump.</b> In his 2013 book America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation, Joshua Kendall wrote that Frederick's father and aunt, and by extension Donald Trump's great-grandfather and great-grandaunt, were called John <b>Trump</b> and Charlotte Luise <b>Trump,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to <b>Trump</b> University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against <b>Trump</b> University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. <b>Trump</b> University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of <b>Trump</b> University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald <b>Trump</b> as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} <b>Trump</b> University clients in three states – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also narrowed the case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.|$|E

5|$|Three {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} asserting that <b>Trump</b> University {{engaged in a}} variety of illegal business practices, ranging from false claims to racketeering.

A third case was filed in New York State court.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When <b>Trump</b> had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The <b>Trump</b> Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The <b>Trump</b> Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with <b>Trump.</b> Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Generals owner Donald <b>Trump</b> had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay <b>Trump</b> $750,000 over the next five seasons for <b>Trump</b> to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E

5|$|Demonstrators in Milwaukee protested peacefully against <b>Trump</b> and Senator Ron Johnson, and {{in support}} of {{immigration}} and women's rights. They marched from Zeidler Union Square to the Federal Building. Milwaukee Coalition Against <b>Trump</b> organized the demonstration; Citizen Action Organizing Cooperative was also represented. Mystic, Connecticut held a protest of around 60 demonstrators who marched through the downtown area. In Rapid City, South Dakota, hundreds of anti-Trump and <b>Trump</b> supporters turned out at a rally that began at noon.

50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that <b>trumping</b> in the hand with more <b>trumps</b> does not add tricks, as these are long cards that will win anyway. In order to gain tricks by <b>trumping,</b> the ruff has to be taken in the short hand, or enough ruffs must be made in the hand that was originally longer in <b>trumps</b> to make it shorter than the other hand (dummy reversal, described above).|$|R
5|$|In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman {{approved}} the project, and construction began on November 4, 1998. After {{construction on the}} freeway began, Wynn's interests were purchased by MGM Grand Inc., thus creating the MGM Mirage company, and plans for Le Jardin were canceled. Despite the fact that Le Jardin was canceled and MGM Mirage's new casino, Borgata, was not scheduled to open until 2003, <b>Trump</b> still fought against the project's plans to build the exit directly to the new casino. Eventually, in January 2000, <b>Trump</b> dropped his case after an exit ramp leading to the <b>Trump</b> Marina {{was added to the}} project.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 <b>Trump</b> {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; <b>Trump</b> {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor {{to talk to his}} wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A <b>Trump</b> Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the <b>Trump</b> Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, <b>Trump</b> submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the office}} of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott {{investigated}} <b>Trump</b> University.
