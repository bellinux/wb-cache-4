5000|$|<b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>management</b> is {{the process}} whereby {{companies}} monitor and manage interactions with all external parties with which it has a relationship. This may include both contractual and non-contractual parties. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>management</b> is conducted primarily {{for the purpose of}} assessing the ongoing behavior, performance and risk that each third party relationship represents to a company. Areas of monitoring include supplier and vendor information management, corporate and social responsibility compliance, supplier risk management, IT vendor risk, anti-bribery/anti-corruption (ABAC) compliance, information security (infosec) compliance, performance measurement, and contract risk management. The importance of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>management</b> was elevated in 2013 when the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stipulated that all regulated banks must manage the risk of all their third parties.|$|E

40|$|The {{last four}} decades {{have seen the}} rise of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> ship <b>management</b> and its {{evolution}} into an industry in its own right. This signified a new reality in ship management practice, whereby the traditional custom of {{doing business with the}} ship owner being also the ship manager was abandoned and a revolutionary model that assigned the role of the owner {{and the role of the}} manager to two different entities was proposed. In essence, then, <b>third</b> <b>party</b> ship <b>management</b> comes very close, in principle and in practice, to the separation of ownership and management as experienced in many industrial fields, after the emergence, in the last half of the 19 th century, of the salaried manager.

40|$|Abstract: We {{develop and}} test {{a theory of}} the supply side of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{conflict}} <b>management.</b> Building on an existing formal model of mediation (Kydd, 2003), we consider the influence of broad, top-down systemic forces on mediator decisions. Our previous work suggests that a strong democratic community and its institutions bolster the likelihood that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> mediation will occur. We integrate this effect of the democratic community into a game theoretic mediation model by adding a simple cost term that punishes a mediator for lying about one side’s resolve for fighting and getting caught. By increasing the supply of credible mediators, global movements toward a strong democratic community {{increase the likelihood that}} potential mediators will intervene in contentious conflicts. Empirical analyses of dyadic data from 1816 - 2001 provide support for our theory, with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> conflict <b>management</b> occurring more frequently when the strength of the democratic community and global institutions rises. We also find that democratic and powerful states serve as mediators more often, and that trade ties...|$|R
