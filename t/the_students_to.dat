5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia led directly to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In {{response}} to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the Ministry of Magic {{and many others}} in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.|$|E

30|$|Rather {{than simply}} lecturing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> <b>the</b> tutor {{provides}} scaffolding for <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> articulate <b>the</b> expectations {{through a number}} of dialog moves. A pump is a generic expression <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> provide more information, such as “What else?” or “Tell me more.” Hints and prompts are selected by the tutor <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> articulate missing content words, phrases, and propositions. A hint tries <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> express a lengthy constituent (e.g., proposition, clause, sentence), whereas a prompt is a question that tries <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> express a single word or phrase. The tutor generates an assertion if <b>the</b> <b>student</b> fails <b>to</b> express <b>the</b> expectation after multiple hints and prompts. AutoTutor provides a cycle of pump → hint → prompt → assertion for each expectation until the expectation is covered. As <b>the</b> <b>student</b> and tutor express information over many turns, the list of expectations is eventually covered and the main task is completed.|$|R

5|$|Other bull terriers like Saxa {{filled in}} as mascot until World War II, when {{athletics}} {{at the school}} paused during the war. After the war, a series of Great Danes, named Bo, Butch, and Hobo, served as mascot. William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, was one of <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> care for Butch. During this time period mascot abductions by rival schools became a common threat to the animal's safety. A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school, but in 1951, the school suspended the football program {{as part of a}} larger backlash against university sports. This left the school without a mascot.|$|E
5|$|The campus fare-free bus {{transit system}} began in 1990 and runs {{throughout}} {{the campus and}} surrounding neighborhoods. In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route. The first hybrid bus on the system used a proprietary diesel-electric propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and {{was developed by the}} Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology. The system is made up of four routes. It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings. The campus has a phone application that allows <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time on the buses arrival to the bus stops.|$|E
5|$|At {{nine o'clock}} in the morning, {{students}} began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When {{a group of students}} sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.|$|E

50|$|Preparing for {{comprehensive}} exams is normally both stressful and time consuming.

A second failure normally guarantees dismissal from the graduate program, though progress on previous attempts may convince <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> program <b>to</b> grant a third, final attempt. Some schools have an intermediate category, passing at the master's level, which does not permit <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> continue doctoral study, but does allow <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> leave with a master's degree despite not having completed a thesis.|$|R
