50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of injury with button battery ingestions is the generation of hydroxide ions, which cause severe chemical burns, at the anode. This is an electrochemical effect of the intact battery, and {{does not require the}} casing to be breached or the contents released. Complications include oesophageal strictures, <b>Tracheo-oesophageal</b> <b>fistulas,</b> vocal cord paralysis, aorto-oesophageal fistulas, and death. The majority of ingestions are not witnessed; presentations are non-specific; battery voltage has increased; the 20 to 25 mm button battery size are more likely to become lodged at the cricopharyngeal junction; and severe tissue damage can occur within 2 hours. The 3 V, 20 mm CR2032 lithium battery has been implicated in many of the complications from button battery ingestions by children of less than 4 years of age.Button batteries can also cause significant necrotic injury when stuck in the nose or ears.|$|R
40|$|This {{report of}} a patient with a {{persistent}} <b>tracheo-oesophageal</b> (TE) <b>fistula</b> after removal of a speech valve describes a modification of the technique described by Rosen et al for closing TE. Under local anaesthesia, an incision was made above the stoma edge from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock. The trachea was separated from the oesophagus to beyond the fistula, and the fistula tract was excised. The oesophageal opening was closed in layers and a local flap rotated from the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle and sutured over the oesophageal closure.

40|$|Objectives: Prospective {{evaluation}} of tracheo-carinal airway reconstructions using pedicled extrathoracic muscle flaps for closing airway defects after non-circumferential resections and after carinal resections {{as part of}} the reconstruction for alleviation of anastomotic tension. Methods: From January 1996 to June 2006, 41 patients underwent tracheo-carinal airway reconstructions using 45 extrathoracic muscle flaps (latissimus dorsi, n= 25; serratus anterior, n= 18; pectoralis major, n= 2) for closing airway defects resulting from (a) bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) with short desmoplastic bronchial stumps after right upper lobectomy (n= 1) and right-sided (pleuro) pneumonectomy (n= 13); (b) right (n= 9) and left (n= 3) associated with partial carinal resections for pre-treated centrally localised tumours; (c) partial non-circumferential tracheal resections for pre-treated tracheal tumours, <b>tracheo-oesophageal</b> <b>fistulas</b> (TEF) and chronic tracheal injury with tracheomalacia (n= 11); (d) carinal resections with the integration of a muscle patch in specific parts of the anastomotic reconstruction for alleviation of anastomotic tension (n= 4). The airway defects ranged from 2 × 1 cm to 8 × 4 cm and involved up to 50 % of the airway circumference. The patients were followed by clinical examination, repeated bronchoscopy, pulmonary function testing and CT scans. The minimum follow-up time was 6 months. Results: Ninety-day mortality was 7. 3 % (3 / 41 patients). Four patients (9. 7 %) sustained muscle flap necrosis requiring re-operation and flap replacement without subsequent mortality, airway dehiscence or stenosis. Airway dehiscence was observed in 1 / 41 patients (2. 4 %) and airway stenosis in 1 / 38 surviving patients (2. 6 %) responding well to topical mitomycin application. Follow-up on clinical grounds, by CT scans and repeated bronchoscopy, revealed airtight, stable and epithelialised airways and no recurrence of BPF or TEF in all surviving patients. Conclusions: Tracheo-carinal airway defects can be closed by use of pedicled extrathoracic muscle flaps after non-circumferential resections and after carinal resections with the muscle patch {{as part of the}} reconstruction for alleviation of anastomotic tensio...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} {{of a patient}} with a malignant <b>tracheo-oesophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> presents a consider-able challenge to both surgeon and anaesthetist. Curative resection is usually impossible {{because of the presence}} of locally advanced disease, malnutrition and ventilatory problems. The aims of palliative treatment are to prevent oesophageal contents from entering the respiratory tract and to restore, as far as possible, normal swallowing. Oesophageal intubation is a simple form of treatment and tubes may be inserted by fibre-optic endoscopy without general anaesthesia [1]. Specially modified tubes have been described for use in cases of malignant <b>tracheo-oesophageal</b> <b>fistula</b> [2, 3], but when intubation fails to produce adequate palliation (as in the patient described) some type of exclusion procedure must be con-sidered, preferably with re-establishment of ali-mentary continuity. A number of such techniques have been described, all involving major surgery [4 - 9]. The mortality from any procedure is appreciable because of the poor general condition of patients with such fistulae. Anaesthesia for the operation of fistula ex-clusion and bypass is difficult and hazardous. There is little or no guidance in textbooks of anaesthesia on the {{management of}} patients with malignant <b>tracheo-oesophageal</b> <b>fistula.</b> This case report demonstrates some of the problems that may be encountered and discusses methods of management.
