5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be temporary; the decree was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> have funded {{improvements}} to local hospitals, clinics, and transportation. On June 6, 2006, voters defeated the measure {{by a margin}} of 58% to 42%. In December 2006, the VTA board allocated $185 million to continue engineering work and environmental clearance on the extension, with a proposal to bring a tax increase to operate the BART extension in 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, {{then decided}} that <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> listed below {{were to be}} {{implemented}} within 9 days unless the Bosnian Serbs signed the peace plan and ceased their attacks, noting that if they should continue, <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> take effect immediately. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> included: ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{restrictions}} were reimposed {{for a period}} of twelve months and relevant exemptions were made relating to the United Nations. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> end once <b>the</b> Council determined that the Liberian ceasefire was fully respected; disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector have been completed; the peace agreement implemented; a diamond certificate of origin regime established and stability maintained in Liberia and the subregion. The transitional government was also urged to join the Kimberley Process and establish its authority over the timber producing areas, including through oversight mechanisms, as soon as possible. The international community was urged to provide assistance to the transitional government during these processes. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be reviewed by 17 June 2004.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, {{a decree}} in Paris allowed cyclists {{in that city}} to turn right or, {{if there is no}} street to the right, proceed {{straight}} ahead on red, under the condition that they “exercise caution” and yield to pedestrians, after road safety experts deemed <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> reduce collisions. During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain stop lights as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or going straight at a T-junction.|$|E
25|$|After {{the passage}} of Measure 47, {{as part of the}} ongoing anti-tax {{movement}} in Oregon, there was some confusion as to how <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be interpreted by the courts. One interpretation had the ballot measure reducing property tax revenues by $458 million in the fiscal year 1997–1998, while another interpretation, provided by the Oregon Attorney General, had it providing a reduction of only $270 million. Much of this disagreement had to do with what limitations Measure 47 would place on increases in the assessment of a property's value.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined {{that as many}} as four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey say that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as $200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. Opponents say that it is unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{confirmed}} that <b>the</b> above <b>measures</b> {{do not apply}} to UNPROFOR, the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia and European Community Monitoring Mission. It also announced its attention that <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be reconsidered once the Bosnian Serb party co-operates in good faith with the United Nations peace plan.|$|R
5000|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{noted the}} failure of the {{relevant}} parties in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to comply with the demands of the Security Council, and thus extended sanctions until 31 July 2006; <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be reviewed if the parties complied.|$|R

25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party {{and the power to}} form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey), HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{foremost}} issues in the Democratic primary concerned school funding. [...] In April 1990, the legislature passed LB1059, which made major changes to the financing of public education in the state. [...] Prior to its passage, roughly 70% of the money for primary and secondary schools came from property taxes and other local sources. [...] The expressed goal of the bill's supporters was to increase the state's contribution to school districts from 25% of operational costs to 45%; this would be funded through a 25% increase in the sales tax and a 17.5% increase in the personal income tax. [...] Proponents maintained that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> lessen inequality among school districts and would avert {{a significant increase in}} property taxes; they also noted that courts in several other states had struck down locally-financed educational systems such as Nebraska's. [...] Opponents argued that the increased taxes would prove burdensome to Nebraskans, particularly the poor, and expressed doubt that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> prevent substantial property-tax increases. [...] The bill passed; Orr vetoed it, but was overridden.|$|E
500|$|Lord Sunderland's power {{began to}} wane in 1719. He {{introduced}} a Peerage Bill which attempted {{to limit the}} size of the House of Lords by restricting new creations. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> have solidified Sunderland's control of the House by preventing the creation of opposition peers but it was defeated after Walpole led the opposition to the bill by delivering what was considered [...] "the most brilliant speech of his career". Walpole and Townshend were reappointed as ministers the following year and a new, supposedly unified, Whig government formed.|$|E
50|$|Proponents {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> merely return AIDS {{to the list}} of {{communicable}} diseases under the public health laws. The ballot argument in favor of the proposition were pathologist John Grauerholz, psychiatrist Nancy T. Mullan, and former Centers for Disease Control advisor Gus S. Sermos. Congressman William E. Dannemeyer was also a proponent.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> {{also not}} apply {{in cases of}} medical {{emergencies}} or flights carrying humanitarian aid. All countries were urged not to prevent travel by official delegations to UNITA headquarters except in humanitarian cases or for purposes of promoting the peace process. The travel sanctions would come into force from 30 September 1997 unless {{it was noted that}} UNITA was beginning to comply.|$|R
5000|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, {{the arms}} embargo, diamond trade ban and {{financial}} and travel sanctions against selected Ivorian officials were renewed until April 30, 2012. The Council {{noted that the}} removal of <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> was conditional upon the holding of elections, the implementation of important parts of the peace process, the protection {{of human rights and}} the stability of <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be reviewed by October 31, 2011.|$|R
500|$|Several {{changes were}} {{proposed}} {{to the office}} of lieutenant governor during Beshear's tenure. In 1984, state representative Bobby Richardson proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish the office. When that effort failed, Richardson introduced a bill in the 1986 General Assembly that would have revoked the lieutenant governor's right to live rent-free in the state's Old Governor's Mansion, eliminated his or her police protection, and restricted his or her use of the state's two executive helicopters. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> also have eliminated the lieutenant governor's salary, paying him or her per diem for days served as acting governor or president of the state senate instead. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> further have lifted the ban on the lieutenant governor holding other employment. Although the bill would have exempted Beshear from its provisions, Beshear still opposed it and charged that it was politically motivated. Richardson had expressed interest in running for lieutenant governor in the past, and Beshear claimed that because he was never elected to the office, he [...] "doesn't want anybody else to have it." [...] Richardson denied that his efforts were a political ploy; he claimed the office was largely ceremonial and served only as a stepping stone to the governorship. Three of the previous four lieutenant governors had subsequently been elected governor, including sitting governor Martha Layne Collins.|$|E
500|$|Along with Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, Reed {{was a major}} {{proponent of}} a {{campaign}} for a transportation special-purpose local-option sales tax, which would have levied a 1% local sales tax for ten years, from 2013 until 2022, to fund transportation infrastructure projects. Reed said that {{the passage of the}} referendum would add jobs and alleviate congestion in the city, while [...] "failing to pass <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be economically damaging" [...] for Atlanta. The proposal was defeated in a referendum, however. Reed stated that he would [...] "work with opponents on the next plan to ease congestion." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Gravel {{endorsed}} the NYC 9/11 Ballot Initiative, saying <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> create a [...] "citizens commission {{rather than a}} government commission" [...] with subpoena power against top U.S. officials to [...] "make a true investigation as to what happened" [...] regarding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Gravel subsequently said that, [...] "Individuals {{in and out of}} government may certainly have participated with the obviously known perpetrators of this dastardly act. Suspicions abound over the analysis presented by government. Obviously an act that has triggered three wars, Afghan, Iraqi and the continuing War on Terror, should be extensively investigated which was not done and which the government avoids addressing." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{proposed}} <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> have repealed a state law, the Comprehensive Permit Act (MGL ch. 40B), {{that allows}} {{an organization that}} is proposing to build government-subsidized housing that includes “low- or moderate-income units {{to apply for a}} single comprehensive permit from a city or town’s zoning board of appeals.” According to the official summary of <b>the</b> <b>measure,</b> <b>the</b> repeal <b>would</b> take effect on January 1, 2011. According to Chemaly, [...] "It's not based on helping poor people. It's all about how can we sell as many units as possible and for them to still be federally and legally (dubbed) affordable" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Security Council urged {{states to}} comply in the {{implementation}} of previous resolutions and impose a travel ban on LURD members. A list of maritime and air companies acting in violation of Resolution 1343 would be listed and ECOWAS states were requested to assist in the identification of such aircraft and vessels. A review of <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be conducted before 7 November 2003 and every six months thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{extended}} {{the arms embargo}} and travel restrictions {{for a period of}} twelve months, and restrictions on the sale of diamonds and timber for a period of six months. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>would</b> be reviewed {{at the request of the}} Liberian government. The government was encouraged to take up the offer of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) of joint forestry patrols.|$|R
500|$|In 1987, at Orr's urging, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed LB773, which changed Nebraska's method of calculating its personal income tax. [...] Up to that time, the state's income tax had been {{a percentage of the}} taxpayer's federal liability. [...] Under the new system, Nebraska would base its tax on federal adjusted gross income, with the state establishing its own system of exemptions and deductions. [...] Proponents argued that such a measure was necessary to produce stability and give Nebraska greater control over its state revenues; opponents objected to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> increase taxes on [...] lower- and middle-income taxpayers, while decreasing them for upper-income Nebraskans. [...] The plan as proposed by Orr would have been revenue-neutral, neither increasing nor decreasing state revenue. [...] The final version, however, as passed by the legislature and signed by Orr, increased receipts by an estimated $11–14 million.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{sponsored}} legislation {{defining a}} hate crime [...] "as an assault, intimidation or threat based on 'actual or perceived' race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin and sexual orientation." [...] He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging, hospital visitation rights and partnerships. His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina. The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail, but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama's election showed that a change should be attempted. Even if passed, <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>would</b> be unenforceable, due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina. Ford worked to outlaw profanity and saggy pants and to keep music from minors that is [...] "profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious or indecent." [...] Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but {{wanted to start a}} discussion specifically targeting young African American men's fashion as well as rap music. He stated: [...] "You don't have to emulate prisoners no more. You can emulate somebody like Barack Obama." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2008, Durbin {{called on}} Congress {{to support a}} measure {{that would give the}} Food and Drug Administration the power to oversee the tobacco industry.
