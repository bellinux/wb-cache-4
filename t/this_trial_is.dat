Recognising the fact that <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> not for {{the identification of the}} prisoner under any name or alias, but simply upon the issue of the fact whether he did or did not commit murder upon the body of Victor Ramirez, as specified in the indictment, we now, waiving all other issues, prepare to prove his innocence by a single witness. That this witness was not produced earlier, was unavoidable; that his testimony was not outlined in the opening, was {{due to the fact that}} only within the last half-hour had he been within the reach of the mandate of this Court.

There is also a strong feeling among the men of this town that a line should be drawn between those that are straight wives and mothers and those that are, {{in the words of}} the Book of Books, taking the primrose path. We don't wish to be hard on any woman; and most of us have a personal regard for Miss Evans for the sake of old times; but theres no getting out of the fact that she has private reasons for wishing to oblige Strapper, and that--if she will excuse my saying so--she is not what I might call morally particular as to what she does to oblige him. Therefore I ask the prisoner not to drive us to give Miss Evans the oath. I ask him to tell us fair and square, as a man who has but a few minutes between him and eternity, what he done with my horse.|$|E

60|$|Nearly a year later, in June 1609, the exhumed {{remains of}} Logan were brought into court (a regular {{practice}} {{in the case of}} dead traitors), and were tried for treason. Five letters by Logan, of July 1600, were now produced. Three were from Logan to conspirators unnamed and unknown. One was to a retainer and messenger of his, Laird Bower, who had died in January 1606. These letters were declared, by several honourable witnesses, to be in Logan’s very unusual handwriting and orthography: they were compared with many genuine letters of his, and no difference was found. The Parliamentary Committee, ‘The Lords of the Articles,’ previously sceptical, were convinced by the five letters, the evidence to handwriting, the energy of the Earl of Dunbar, and the eloquence of the King’s Advocate. Logan’s children were all forfeited, and Dunbar saved the money which he owed to Logan’s estate. <b>This</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> not alluded to, either by Calderwood or Archbishop Spottiswoode, in their histories. The five letters produced in the trial of Logan exist, and have been accepted as authentic by Mr. Tytler and Mr. Hill Burton, but not by writers who favour the Ruthvens.

6000|$|... "I shall {{prove to}} you, {{gentlemen of the}} jury," [...] said the Colonel solemnly, drawing a Bible from his coat-tail pocket, [...] "that the {{defendant}} for the last twelve months conducted an amatory correspondence with the plaintiff by means of underlined words of Sacred Writ and church psalmody, such as 'beloved,' 'precious,' and 'dearest,' occasionally appropriating whole passages which seemed apposite to his tender passion. I shall call your attention to one of them. The defendant, while professing to be a total abstainer,--a man who, in my own knowledge, has refused spirituous refreshment as an inordinate weakness of the flesh,--with shameless hypocrisy underscores with his pencil the following passage, and presents it to the plaintiff. The gentlemen of the jury will {{find it in the}} Song of Solomon, page 548, chapter ii. verse 5." [...] After a pause, in which the rapid rustling of leaves was heard in the jury-box, Colonel Starbottle declaimed in a pleading, stentorian voice, [...] "'Stay me with--er--FLAGONS, comfort me with--er--apples--for I am--er--sick of love.' Yes, gentlemen!--yes, you may well turn from those accusing pages and look at the double-faced defendant. He desires--to--er--be--'stayed with flagons'! I am not aware at present what kind of liquor is habitually dispensed at these meetings, and for which the defendant so urgently clamored; but it will be my duty, before <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> over, to discover it, if I have to summon every barkeeper in this district. For the moment I will simply call your attention to the QUANTITY. It is not a single drink that the defendant asks for--not a glass of light and generous wine, to be shared with his inamorata, but a number of flagons or vessels, each possibly holding a pint measure--FOR HIMSELF!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS COVINGTON: I {{have learned}} from Messrs. Farmer & [...] Pettigrew the liberal and I may say {{extraordinary}} generosity shown [...] towards myself by the late General Mathieson, whose loss I most [...] deeply deplore. My feelings of gratitude are at the present moment [...] overwhelmed by the very painful position in which I find myself. I [...] had, of course, heard, upon calling at your door to make inquiries, [...] that little Walter was missing, and was deeply grieved at the news, [...] though not at the time dreaming that it could affect me personally. [...] Now, however, {{the circumstances of the}} case are completely changed, [...] for, by the provisions of the will, I should benefit pecuniarily by [...] the poor child's death. I will not for a moment permit myself to [...] believe that he is not alive and well, and do not doubt that you [...] will speedily recover him; but, until this occurs, I feel that some [...] sort of suspicion must attach to me, who am the only person having [...] an interest in his disappearance. The thought that this may be so [...] is distressing to me in the extreme. Since I heard of his [...] disappearance I have spent the greater part of my time in [...] traversing the slums of London in hopes of lighting upon him. I [...] shall now undertake wider researches, and shall to-day insert [...] advertisements in all the daily papers, offering one thousand [...] pounds for his recovery. I feel sure that you at least will not for [...] a moment entertain unjust suspicions concerning me, but those who [...] do not know me well may do so, and although at present none of the [...] facts have been made public, I feel as if I were already under a [...] cloud, and that men in the club look askance at me, and unless the [...] child is found my position will speedily become intolerable. My [...] only support in <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> <b>is</b> my consciousness of innocence. You [...] will excuse me for intruding upon your sorrow at the present [...] moment, but I felt compelled to write as I have done, and to assure [...] you that I will use every effort in my power to discover the child, [...] not only for his own sake and yours, but because I feel that until [...] he is discovered I must continue to rest under the terrible, if [...] unspoken, suspicion of being concerned in his disappearance.|$|E
