40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This study {{analyzed}} <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> appeals from <b>the</b> November 2012 <b>campaigns</b> <b>for</b> {{and against}} marriage equality. This {{study found that}} <b>the</b> <b>campaigns</b> against marriage equality appealed to their base voters {{in order to preserve}} and promote heteronormative understandings of marriage and ways of living. <b>The</b> <b>campaigns</b> <b>for</b> marriage equality, however, appealed to voters on all sides of the issue by encouraging conversations that challenged heteronormative understandings of marriage and society and promoted marriage and society as inclusive of LGBTQs. This study also found that there were two dominant narratives that competed against one another in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>campaigns</b> against marriage equality used a repressive narrative that framed marriage, family, religion, society, and individuals as exclusively heterosexual and ultimately aimed to put queers "in the closet. " In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>campaigns</b> <b>for</b> marriage equality used a confessional narrative that challenged the repressive narrative by framing marriage, family, faith, citizenship, society, and individuals as inclusive of LGBTQs. Overall, the findings from this study describe how the message strategies and appeals by <b>the</b> <b>campaigns</b> <b>for</b> marriage equality were successful in persuading voters and ultimately winning at the ballot box in November 2012, by crafting messages that shaped public attitudes and shifted support in favor of marriage equality...|$|R
