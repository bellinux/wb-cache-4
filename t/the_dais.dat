5|$|In March 2012, the parody {{national}} anthem from the film's soundtrack, which acclaims Kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports {{and having the}} second cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix. The gold medalist, Mariya Dmitriyenko, stood on <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was restaged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E

5|$|They {{rendezvous}} in {{the outer}} chambers of the Helheim complex, deep below the Arctic Sea. With the ritual performed, Lara is able to use Mjolnir to open the gates of Helheim. Along the way, Lara discovers the horrifying truth of her mother's fate – she {{has been turned into}} a thrall, thus Lara forcibly shoots her. Natla reveals the true extent of her manipulation of Lara, also revealing that she was responsible for killing Lara's father. The doppelgänger prepares to kill Lara, but she is saved by Amanda. It is revealed that the Midgard Serpent was a Norse metaphor for the many tectonic divisions that encircle the world, beneath the seas. The doomsday device was built upon the most unstable junction of these lines and its activation would cause massive volcanic activity across the whole planet and the destruction of most of humanity. Lara successfully destabilises the device and strikes Natla with Mjolnir, sending her down into the pool of deadly eitr below. Lara and Amanda escape together using <b>the</b> <b>dais,</b> like the one that brought Lara's mother to Helheim, teleporting back to the temple in Nepal (from Tomb Raider: Legend).|$|E
25|$|On June 6, 2007, Bork {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} New York City against the Yale Club over an {{incident}} that had occurred a year earlier. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> to speak at an event, he fell, because of the Yale Club's failure to provide any steps or handrail between the floor and <b>the</b> <b>dais.</b> (After his fall, he successfully climbed to <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork's injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.|$|E

5000|$|The Fund {{had three}} primary goals: {{providing}} medical tuition, medical relief, and female nurses and midwives {{to assist in}} hospitals and private homes. [...] The Fund supplied scholarships for the medical education (medical tuition) of women in India. The education of traditional Indian midwives, called dias, was a major goal of the Fund because many western doctors observed <b>the</b> <b>dais’s</b> practices and found their traditions to be harmful. [...] For example, <b>the</b> <b>dais’s</b> would massage <b>the</b> abdomen of the mother to speed up labor however that tradition caused uterine prolapse, a widespread issue amongst Indian women at the time. Because the dias’ methods were viewed as violent and extremely harmful, the Fund put forth money to educate them on successful ways to help women before, during, and after childbirth. The Fund also provided medical relief by establishing dispensaries and cottage hospitals for women and children under female superintendence. [...] In addition, it opened female wards in existing hospitals also under female management {{as well as all}} women hospitals called zenana hospitals. The Fund also supplied trained female nurses and midwives in hospitals and in private homes.|$|R
25|$|With the {{installation}} of a new pipe organ in 1923, the first changes to the sanctuary were made. The original chancel had a small organ {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> with space for a small choir on the right of the pulpit. The newer, larger organ required two sets of pipes, and they were on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>dais,</b> with Tudor Gothic wood screens. A larger space was provided for a choir on the right. These changes reflected the growing use of music in the service.|$|E

25|$|The ruins were {{protected}} with Grade II listed building status in 1953. Currently The Beaudesert Trust {{which owns the}} remains and gardens is applying to stabilise the ruins and restore the gardens to their original state. The standing ruins consist of three main components; the south wall of the Great Hall, a parallel wall which formed {{the north side of}} the Great Hall with an attached fragment of the west wing and the north west angle of the house. The south wall still retains something of its 15th-century character, including some good-quality ashlar masonry, the principal windows, a window lighting <b>the</b> <b>dais,</b> and the remains of a possible fireplace, also associated with <b>the</b> <b>dais.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Tamamushi Shrine is {{a common}} example of {{painting}} that derived from Baekje and provides important evidence for the Korean peninsula's and the Chinese mainland's strong cultural transfer to the Japanese islands. The shrine is named for the many wings of the tamamushi beetle that once adorned it but have since deteriorated. The paintings that cover building and dais are of Jataka tales, bodhisattvas, the Four Heavenly Kings, and other buddhist iconography. The front panels of the building show the Four Guardian Kings clad in armor with long flowing scarves. On the side doors are bodhisattvas holding lotus blossoms and forming a mudra. On the back is represented a sacred landscape with heights topped with pagodas. <b>The</b> <b>dais</b> shows on its front relics, seated monks making offerings, and apsara. On the back is depicted Mount Sumeru. The right side shows {{a scene from the}} Nirvana Sutra, where the Buddha offers his life in return for more of the sacred teachings, before being caught in his plummet by Indra. On the left panel of <b>the</b> <b>dais</b> is a scene from the Golden Light Sutra of a bodhisattva removing his upper garments before casting himself from a cliff to feed a hungry tigress and her cubs.|$|E

25|$|The House of Representatives Chamber has 448 {{permanent}} seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do {{not have}} assigned seats. The chamber {{is large enough to}} accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history.

The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats. In this respect, the Senate differs from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and other parliamentary bodies in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere.|$|E
