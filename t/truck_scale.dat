25|$|In farming communities, each {{town had}} one or more small grain {{elevators}} that would serve the local growers. The classic grain elevator was constructed with wooden cribbing and had nine or more larger square or rectangular bins arranged in 3 × 3 or 3 × 4 or 4 × 4 or more patterns. Wooden cribbed elevators usually had a driveway with <b>truck</b> <b>scale</b> and office on one side, a rail line {{on the other side}} and additional grain storage annex bins on either side.|$|E
25|$|The ZIP codes used in {{the city}} of Henderson are 42419 and 42420, and it uses the {{telephone}} area codes 270 and 364. Because the two area codes cover the same geographic region, 10-digit dialing (i.e., including the area code when dialing, even for local calls) has been required since February 2014. The exceptions are the Ellis Park Race Course racing track (as mentioned above), the Kentucky DOT <b>truck</b> <b>scale,</b> and the Trocadero Plaza Sinclair station, all located on US Highway 41, and the Marina Plaza on adjacent Waterworks Road, which all use Indiana's 812 area code despite being located in Henderson County.|$|E

The first portable <b>truck</b> <b>scale</b> record in the US was units operated by the Weight Patrol of the Los Angeles Motor Patrol in 1929.
