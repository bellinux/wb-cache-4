40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{the effects}} of iron ion intercalations on lead-tellurate glasses were {{investigated}} via FTIR, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopies. This homogeneous glass system has compositionsFeO·(100 −) [4 TeO·PbO], where[*]=[*] 0 - 60  mol%. The presented observations in these mechanisms show that the lead ions have a pronounced affinity towards [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units,</b> resulting in the deformation of the Te-O-Te linkages, and leading to the intercalation of [PbO] ([*]=[*] 3, 4) and [FeO] ([*]=[*] 4, 6) entities in the [TeO] chain network. The formation of negatively charged [FeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> implies the attraction of Pb ions in order to compensate for this electrical charge. Upon increasing the FeO content to 60  mol%, the network can accommodate an excess of oxygen through the formation of [FeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> and the conversion of [TeO] into [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> For even higher FeO contents, Raman spectra indicate {{a greater degree of}} depolymerization of the vitreous network than FTIR spectra do. The bands due to the Pb-O bond vibrations are very strongly polarized and the [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> convert into [TeO] units via an intermediate coordination stage termed "[TeO]" <b>structural</b> <b>units.</b> Our UV-Vis spectroscopic data show two mechanisms: (i) the conversion of the Fe to Fe {{at the same time as}} the oxidation of Pb to Pb ions for samples with low FeO contents; (ii) when the FeO content is high ([*]≥[*] 50  mol%), the Fe ions capture positive holes and are transferred to Fe ions through a photochemical reaction, while the Pb ions are formed by the reduction of Pb ions. DFT calculations show that the addition of FeO to lead-tellurate glasses seems to break the axial Te-O bonds, and the [TeO] <b>structural</b> <b>units</b> are gradually transformed into [TeO]- and [TeO]-type polyhedra. Analyzing these data further indicates a gradual conversion of the lead ions from covalent to ionic environment.
