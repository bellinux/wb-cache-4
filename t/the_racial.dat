40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} senior administrative decision-making regarding <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate within institutions of higher education. Specifically, I addressed the following questions: 	 1. How do senior administrators learn/develop their views about diversity? 	 2. What is their experience with diverse populations and how does this 			influence their views about diversity? 	 3. What organizational characteristics of the University of Maryland influenced their decisions? 	 4. What common factors influence senior administrators decision-making 	regarding 	policies and practices related to <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate? To answer these questions, I engaged in an interpretive case study analysis (Merriam, 1998) of senior administrators at the University of Maryland. Data obtained from semi-structured interviews with fifteen senior administrators and documents were analyzed to create themes around how senior administrators make decisions regarding <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate. This study has implications for expanding theory, particularly regarding decision-making in higher education. In the most general sense, the data collected in this study was consistent with existing research on decision-making within institutions of higher education. In this study, decision-making regarding <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate was influenced both by individual differences and the organizational nature of institutions of higher education (Baldridge et al. 1979, 1991). This study also reinforced the research by Hurtado et al. (1998, 1999) showing that socio-historical forces, governmental policies and an institution's legacy of inclusion/exclusion, the psychological and behavioral climates affect <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate. Implications for practice suggests five propositions for consideration regarding the factors that influence the decision-making of administrators regarding <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate: 1) Race matters in decision-making, 2) Experiences that administrators have with diverse others, diverse ideas and diverse institutions affect the decisions they make regarding <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate, 3) <b>The</b> institutional context in which decisions are made matters a great deal, 4) Faculty members play an important role in shaping administrative decisions and how they are engaged and involved in diversity efforts is important, 5) Given the professional nature of higher education, leaders can shape <b>the</b> campus <b>racial</b> climate through <b>the</b> use of symbols...|$|R

40|$|In this address, Professor Robert Chang {{discusses}} how <b>the</b> current <b>racial</b> paradigm {{has become}} naturalized so that race in America is generally understood to mean black and white. It is {{this notion of}} race that limits people understanding and willingness to engage with the history and current state of Asian Americans and Latinos in the United States. Instead of being interested participants, they are seen as interlopers. Yet this status as interloper is precisely why Asian Americans and Latinos are important in discussions of race-our existence disrupts the comfortable binary of <b>the</b> black/white <b>racial</b> paradigm in which <b>the</b> black <b>racial</b> subject is produced by and through its opposition to <b>the</b> white <b>racial</b> subject, and vice versa.
