5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying {{for a job in}} which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that}} the local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E

50|$|The 1920s was {{to prove}} a {{critical}} decade in terms of stricter ethno-religious compartments; hence, Muslim Cypriots who remained on the island gradually embraced the ideology of Turkish nationalism due {{to the impact of}} the Kemalist Revolution. At its core were the Kemalist values of secularism, modernization and westernization; reforms such as the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet, adoption of western dress and secularization, were adopted voluntarily by Muslim Turkish Cypriots, who had been prepared for such changes not just by the Tanzimat but also by several decades of British rule. Many of those Cypriots who until then had still identified <b>themselves</b> primarily <b>as</b> Muslims began now <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> principally <b>as</b> Turks in Cyprus.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{apparent}} {{contradictions in}} the gender identifications of Taiwanese Buddhist nuns. Because the texts and teachings of their tradition provide conflicting messages about women 2 ̆ 7 s spiritual abilities, the nuns create a complex gender cosmology {{as a means}} to accommodate textual contradictions without rejecting any textual statements. This strategy allows the nuns to assert that they have spiritual abilities equal to those of men without rejecting or contradicting textual statements that they do not. Without denying that they are women (and that they are therefore threatening to men) the nuns primarily identify with the male gender. Compartmentalizing and contextualizing gender symbols allows the nuns <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> both <b>as</b> men and as women without contradiction...|$|R
25|$|In the 1650s {{after the}} Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Catholics were banned from {{dwelling}} {{within the city}} limits under the vengeful Cromwellian settlement but this law was not strictly enforced. Ultimately, this religious discrimination led to the Old English community abandoning their English roots and coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> part of the native Irish community.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the reign}} of Ivan the Great (1462–1505), Moscow became a major {{regional}} power, and the annexation of the vast Republic of Novgorod in 1478 laid the foundations for a Russian national state.

25|$|Between the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians {{emigrated to}} the New England region. About half of them {{returned}} home. The generations born in the United States would eventually come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Franco-Americans.

As the networked digital economy develops, systems will become more complex, creating a robust market for experienced systems analysts who use simulation to solve operational problems and manage these complex systems. Physicians solve problems involving a complex biological system, i. e., the human body. The medical education system in the United States is examined and proposed {{as a model for}} an education structure for professional systems analysts. The objectives and requirements of simulation education are examined and a curriculum structure is proposed. It is also argued that certifying exams would do much to promote the profession and improve the educational environment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} how {{a cohort}} of eight young women who underwent certain difficulties whilst at secondary school experienced their transition from secondary school to either work or further education. It explores changes in their perception of events and happenings that they classified as significant to them, and the influence that these changes of perception had on their evolving life-course. While not formally classified as emotionally or behaviorally challenged, all {{the participants in this}} study claimed to have had varying depths of difficulty when at secondary school, some alleging that they had been classified as troublesome by their teachers and others claiming <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> disruptive in classroom settings.

25|$|Luther's Small Catechism proved {{especially}} effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors. Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. He rewrote each article of the Creed {{to express the}} character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life.|$|E
25|$|During deliberations, {{leaders can}} {{intervene}} when debates get heated.

Deutsch and Coleman (2000) explain that reframing allows conflicting parties <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> being in a collaborative, while producing a positive atmosphere that is conductive to creativity and one that increases the potential solutions available.|$|E
25|$|The steel {{industry}} completed making its case on February 14. Final arguments were made against the union shop.

Fairless, in particular, felt that if the WSB included a union shop proposal in its recommendations, the ruling would put the government's imprimatur on unionization. The {{steel industry}}, it was felt, was the last defender of capitalism and the free market.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between private schooling and the middle classes in urban India. It complicates the argument that private schools have become spaces in which young people come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> less <b>as</b> representatives of one ethnic or caste community and more as indices of their own family’s economic standing and {{as members of a}} class group. I argue that {{a closer look at the}} way in which students experience and narrativise private schooling reveals a much less straightforward process. Schools, I argue, are mobilised by youth as flexible tools in complex and competing strategies to construct a middle social space for themselves. The article seeks to address a dearth of research on the complex and severely contested processes of transformation of the self implicated in strategies towards urban educational opportunities...|$|R

50|$|According to self-categorization theory, depersonalization {{describes}} {{a process of}} self-stereotyping. This is where, under conditions of social category salience and consequent accentuation, “people come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> more <b>as</b> the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others”. Under these conditions a perceiver directly bases their behaviour and beliefs on the norms, goals and needs of a salient ingroup. For example, if a person's salient self-category becomes 'army officer' then that person {{is more likely to}} act in terms of the norms associated with that category (e.g. to wear a uniform, follow orders, and distrust an enemy) and less likely to act in terms of other potential self-categories. Here the person can be said to be accentuating the similarities between his or herself {{and other members of the}} 'army officers' category.|$|R
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how people perceive themselves. For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might still remember related events in their lives, such as their emotional reactions to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human emotional reactions to life events as a medical issue.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
25|$|English {{government}} {{went through}} periods {{of reform and}} decay, with parliament emerging as {{an important part of}} the administration. Women had an important economic role and noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence. The English began <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> superior to their neighbours in the British Isles and regional identities continued to be significant. New reformed monastic orders and preaching orders reached England from the twelfth century, pilgrimage became highly popular and Lollardy emerged as a major heresy from the later fourteenth century. The Little Ice Age had a significant impact on agriculture and living conditions. Economic growth began to falter at the end of the thirteenth century, owing to a combination of overpopulation, land shortages and depleted soils. Technology and science was driven in part by the Greek and Islamic thinking that reached England from the twelfth century. In warfare, mercenaries were increasingly employed and adequate supplies of ready casequipped and uniformed. Medieval England produced art in the form of paintings, carvings, books, fabrics and many functional but beautiful h became essential for the success of campaigns. By the time of Edward III, armies were smaller, but the troops were better objects. Literature was produced in Latin and French and from the reign of Richard II there was an upsurge in the use of Middle English in poetry. Music and singing were important were used in religious ceremonies, court occasions and to accompany theatrical works. During the twelfth century the Anglo-Norman architectural style became more ornate, with pointed arches derived from France, termed Early English Gothic.|$|E
40|$|Imagine {{children}} {{attending school}} every day without the ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> represented, <b>as</b> {{if they do not}} exist. Unfortunately, this is a reality for many students in the United States. Their language, race, religion, family structure, disability, socioeconomic status, and culture are not visible within the walls of the classroom. What kind of message does this send America's youth? In a nation that grows more diverse each year, the literature educators select must accurately reflect all children. While educators incorporate books showing different cultures, races, and languages, many fail to address family structure. Families in the United States are changing. They are becoming more diverse each year. Unfortunately, children's literature is not keeping up with this shift. Teachers, parents, and community members must seek out books representing various family types to include in their libraries. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R

However, this interaction effect was only present for extravert and not for introvert respondents. Theoretical and practical implications, together with some future research ideas are suggested. ...|$|R

30|$|Social {{identification}} {{can relate}} to collective action {{through the process of}} depersonalization. Social identification puts emphasis on the group and leads to a depersonalization of the self-concept, which consists of a unique overlap of many social identities (Brewer, 1991; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987). Turner et al. (1987) argue that depersonalization refers to how people come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> less <b>as</b> unique individuals and more as an “interchangeable exemplar of a social category” (p. 50). They argue that depersonalization is the basic process that underlies group processes, such as collective action. Brewer (1991) explains that depersonalization relates to transformations in self-definitions, which can in turn alter “the meaning of self-interest and self-serving motivation” (p. 476). The social self can therefore also motivate individuals to act on behalf of the group instead of out of mere self-interest (Brewer, 1991). This relates to the perception of group interests, since social identification can increase the awareness of belonging to a group with shared political interests, which in turn enhances psychological engagement with politics and incentivizes political participation (Brady, Verba, & Schlozman, 1995).|$|R
