5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the head is fused to the skull. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible beneath <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
5|$|Lyle spots {{an unknown}} person {{running away from}} them in the subway and the team follows. When the group {{approaches}} {{the spot where the}} train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible beneath <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of}} the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible through <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of}} the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

25|$|Although no Screamers {{are ever}} seen in the book, they are heard - their scream is so loud as {{to be able to}} deafen and daze people far away from it. They are also the primary method of alarm for {{sleeping}} Myrmidons - only a Screamer can wake a Myrmidon quickly. They do not travel in groups. It is mentioned that when a human is close to the screamer while it screams it can peel away <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the insides of their ears.|$|E
25|$|Potentially {{damaging}} mechanical, thermal, {{and chemical}} stimuli are detected by nerve endings called nociceptors, which {{are found in}} <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>on</b> internal surfaces such as the periosteum, joint surfaces, and in some internal organs. The concentration of nociceptors varies throughout the body; they are found in greater numbers in the skin than in deep internal surfaces. Some nociceptors are unspecialized free nerve endings that have their cell bodies outside the spinal column in the dorsal root ganglia. Nociceptors are categorized according to the axons which travel from the receptors to the spinal cord or brain.|$|E

25|$|Graves' disease, {{also known}} as toxic diffuse goiter, is an {{autoimmune}} disease that affects the thyroid. It frequently results in and {{is the most common}} cause of hyperthyroidism. It also often results in an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea, and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy.

25|$|The Vickers-Wibault {{construction}} {{method was}} based on the patents of Michel Wibault, who began working with Vickers in 1922. It was a way of producing an all-metal aircraft with an airframe built up from simple, non-machined metal shapes, covered with very thin e.g. 0.016 in (0.4mm) corrugated light alloy sheets. Skin panels were riveted {{to each other and to}} the underlying structure; <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the wings was not stressed. Vickers' first experience of the method was with the licence built Wibault Scout. The first Vickers design using this construction was the Vireo and the third, the Viastra, used a blend of Wibault and Vickers construction techniques.|$|E
25|$|A {{dog that}} survives {{distemper}} {{will continue to}} have both nonlife-threatening and life-threatening signs throughout its lifespan. The most prevalent nonlife-threatening symptom is hard pad disease. This occurs when a dog experiences the thickening of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>on</b> the pads of its paws {{as well as on the}} end of its nose. Another lasting symptom commonly is enamel hypoplasia. Puppies, especially, will have damage to the enamel of teeth that are not completely formed or those that have not yet grown through the gums. This is a result of the virus's killing the cells responsible for manufacturing the tooth enamel. These affected teeth tend to erode quickly.|$|E
