5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
25|$|Artens {{wants his}} book <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> an anti war {{campaign}} tool, and various anti war {{organizations such as}} CODEPINK, Global Exchange and the Campus Antiwar Network have co-sponsored his author’s tour.|$|E
25|$|According to Imre Galambos, the {{function}} of the Shuowen was educational. Since Han studies of writing are attested to have begun by pupils of 8 years old, Xu Shen's categorization of characters was proposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a mnemonic methodology for juvenile students.|$|E

25|$|Sovereignty Rights: Native Americans hold unique {{rights as}} {{sovereign}} bodies, leading to their relations {{to be controlled}} by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.|$|E
25|$|The sixth decree of the Seventh Provincial Council of Baltimore is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> {{applying}} {{to those who}} rashly (temere) marry before a Protestant minister.

25|$|Prior {{to spiritual}} realization, charnel grounds are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> terrifying places, full of 'roaming spirits' (Sanskrit: gana) and 'hungry ghosts' (Sanskrit: pretas) indeed localities that incite {{consuming}} fear. In a charnel ground there are bodies everywhere in different states of decomposition: freshly dead bodies, decaying bodies, skeletons and disembodied bones.|$|E

25|$|Adler (1995) cautioned {{the failure}} of modern {{medicine}} to implement the biopsychosocial model, which incorporates all aspects of a patient’s experience in a scientific approach into the clinical picture, often results in chronically-ill patients deferring to non-traditional and alternative forms of therapy, seeking <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a whole, not a part, which may be problematic among patients with FSS.|$|E
25|$|From the 12th century onward chivalry came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a moral, {{religious}} and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars {{of the code}} varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life and manners of the knight at home in his castle and with his court.|$|E
25|$|KELLER, 1986 (quoted in Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1) {{highlights}} that Integrated Crop Management is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> {{compromise between}} different agricultural production systems. It rather {{must be understood}} as production system with a targeted, dynamic and continuous use and development of experiences which {{were made in the}} so-called conventional farming. In addition to natural scientific findings, impulses from organic farming are also taken up.|$|E

25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Only when a star has exhausted {{most of its}} nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size. Planetary nebulae came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led {{to the idea that}} planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E
25|$|A Bézier {{curve is}} defined {{by a set of}} control points P0 through Pn, where n is called its order (n = 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc.). The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the {{intermediate}} control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> affine combinations, the coefficients sum to 1.|$|E
25|$|The quantum {{revolution}} of the mid-1920s occurred {{under the direction of}} both Einstein and Bohr, and their post-revolutionary debates were about making sense of the change. The shocks for Einstein began in 1925 when Werner Heisenberg introduced matrix equations that removed the Newtonian elements of space and time from any underlying reality. The next shock came in 1926 when Max Born proposed that mechanics were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a probability without any causal explanation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} methodological {{problems}} of using models from â��complexity scienceâ�� for understanding policy process. The article {{argues that the}} problem of complexity is not just a problems for modelling, but needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understand</b> <b>as</b> a problem in the world of social policy itself. Highlighting the possibility of describing policy process with complexity science, the article then situates the issues through three scenarios from an ethnographic study of collaboration in social welfare. The article asks, â��how do we make connections between these scenarios as part of a policy process?â�� and suggests there is value in understanding policy process as constituted in communications. Doing so suggests recognising the inherent role of â��ignoranceâ�� as part of policy process...|$|R

25|$|In {{the seventh}} century, foreign Christian missionaries {{initiated}} {{the conversion of}} Anglo-Saxon England, with repercussions for burial practices. Though common in the fifth and sixth centuries, cremation rapidly declined {{as a form of}} burial, with few known later examples. The Christian Church initially objected little to grave goods, although there was a decline in their popularity as they came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> irrelevant. Instances of rich grave goods would however continue into the eighth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} Standardization often {{involves}} one variety {{of a language}} taking precedence over other social and regional dialects of a language. Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> supra-dialectal and the ‘best’ form of the language.|$|E
25|$|The speech which Weston {{delivers}} at the book's climax (in Chapter 20), and Ransom's {{effort to}} render {{it into the}} Old Solar spoken by the Malacandrians, demonstrate the enormous gulf in cultural and moral perceptions, which renders Weston's value judgements utterly untranslatable and {{may be said to}} make them absurd; thus creating a sort of social criticism. The “translation” that we read is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a back-translation into English of what Ransom said in Old Solar.|$|E

50|$|Although {{information}} has been bought and sold since ancient times, {{the idea of an}} information marketplace is relatively recent. The nature of such markets is still evolving, which complicates development of sustainable business models.

25|$|A {{representation}} {{is a type}} of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree to which an artistic representation resembles the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the Mona Lisa and a child's crayon drawing of Lisa del Giocondo would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a matter of aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Their luminosity, though, is very low, implying {{that they must}} be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so planetary nebulae came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E
25|$|Christian anarchism {{is a form}} of {{religious}} anarchism that seeks to combine anarchism with Christianity, claiming that anarchism is justified by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Early Christian communities have been described by Christian anarchists and some historians as possessing anarcho-communist characteristics. Christian anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Ammon Hennacy believe that the teachings of Paul of Tarsus caused a shift from the earlier more egalitarian and anarchistic teachings of Jesus. Others, however, believe that Paul with his strong emphasis on God's Providence, is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a holding to anarchist principles.|$|E
