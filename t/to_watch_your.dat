To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand.

If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>your</b> heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E
