25|$|Modern {{education}} in India is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving.

BusinessWeek criticises the Indian curriculum, saying it revolves around rote learning and ExpressIndia suggests <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> focused on cramming.|$|E
25|$|While {{most studies}} of {{dialogue}} journals {{focus on the}} development of student writing, several researchers have explored their use and value for developing and assessing students' reading competence, especially students acquiring English as a second language.

In dialogue journal interactions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the topic is about reading assignments, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.|$|E

25|$|By 2015, {{there has}} been a major {{improvement}} of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students {{for the first time to}} teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} {{religious}} segregation causing greater society wide segregation {{can be seen}} in private schools. When parents choose {{to send their children to}} private schools, they are often religious institutions, and because religious institutions are often racially segregated, this means <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> in turn in racially segregated classrooms. There is some concern that an increase in the use of school vouchers in the United States will also then increase the number of students in segregated schools, as school vouchers are generally used to send children to private religious institutions.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, UK {{universities}} {{have been hit}} by considerable funding cuts as part of government austerity measures. This, in part, {{has led to an}} increase in the rental of student accommodation during the winter, spring, and summer vacation periods to house conference delegates and tourists, often at rates similar to those charged by upmarket hotels. Unfortunately, this often means <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> forced to vacate their rooms up to three times per year. As a result, several student-focussed personal storage and shipping companies have come into existence that cater to this need.|$|E

25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student {{should know and be}} able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 2014, the College Board {{announced}} {{its plan to}} redesign the SAT in order to link the exam more closely to the work high school students encounter in the classroom. The new exam was administered {{for the first time}} in March, 2016. Some of the major changes are: an emphasis on the use of evidence to support answers, a shift away from obscure vocabulary to words <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> more likely to encounter in college and career, a math section that is focused on fewer areas, a return to the 1600-point score scale, an optional essay, and the removal of penalty for wrong answers (rights-only scoring). To combat the perceived advantage of costly test preparation courses, the College Board announced a new partnership with Khan Academy to offer free online practice problems and instructional videos.|$|E
25|$|There are differing {{views on}} how many schools a student should apply to. Several reports suggest that {{applying}} to too many schools caused unnecessary stress and expense, and hampers a student from targeting applications to a few select schools. But other advisors suggest that applying to more schools increases overall chances for acceptance. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest applying to eight to ten schools is best, and that applying to too many schools is counterproductive. There are reports that {{the average number of}} schools <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> applying to has been increasing, perhaps because of greater use of the Common Application. In 2008, applications to Harvard University had increased to a record number at 27,278, a 19% increase from the year before. One effect of these numerous applications is to lower the average yield of colleges, which dropped from 46% to 38% in 2001 according to one account.|$|E

25|$|Filch is {{revealed}} to be a Squib in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Harry accidentally discovers that {{he is trying to}} teach himself basic magic from a Kwikspell correspondence course. Nonetheless, Filch is at least able to use wizarding devices that have their own innate magic, such as the Secrecy Sensor used in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It is hinted that his dislike of students may stem from his disappointment and jealousy at not being able to do magic. In the Half Blood Prince, Harry and Hermione jokingly suspect that he is in a relationship with Irma Pince, the librarian at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> out of bed.

25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
