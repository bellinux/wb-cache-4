25|$|In revertive pulsing, the pulses {{were sent}} in the reverse {{direction}} to the sender, a complex and sophisticated piece of hardware. If a selector failed to advance, it stopped sending pulses to the sender. A timer in the sender detected the failure, returned a <b>trouble</b> <b>tone</b> to the caller, held the switch train out of service with a grounded sleeve lead so no other caller could use the faulty circuit. An automated alarm alerted maintenance staff.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{she looks}} at you," [...] Ruth persisted, in a <b>troubled</b> <b>tone,</b> [...] "as though she had some claim; as though I, even poor I, were an interloper for the tiny share I might have of your {{thoughts}} or sympathy. I do not understand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he isn't," [...] said Marilla in a <b>troubled</b> <b>tone.</b> [...] "He's {{had some}} real bad spells with his heart {{this spring and}} he won't spare himself a mite. I've been real worried about him, but he's some better this while back and we've got a good hired man, so I'm hoping he'll kind of rest and pick up. Maybe he will now you're home. You always cheer him up." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{chorus of}} exclamations had arisen round them--light {{surprise}} and idle {{interest for the}} most part. Few there realized the import of the message--fewer still realized that it meant anything to them. Before long the dancing was on again and the hum of pleasure was as loud as ever. Gertrude and Allan Daly talked the news over in low, <b>troubled</b> <b>tones.</b> Walter Blythe had turned pale and left the room. Outside he met Jem, hurrying up the rock steps.|$|R
5000|$|... "Topping {{the night}} off with Adele was {{a stroke of}} genius. All that pain, all that emotion, {{vibrating}} through {{the voices of the}} all-girl <b>Trouble</b> <b>Tones</b> was sublimely executed. Santana, whom you feel a bit sorry for because she’s been outed to the whole school and possibly all of Ohio, gives an electrifying cover of Adele's hits 'Rumour Has It' and 'Someone Like You'. She is a star in the making. Her voice was golden. She was ably aided by Mercedes, and the back-up singers." [...] — Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{except my}} love!" [...] she exclaimed, {{with the first}} note of <b>trouble</b> in her <b>tone.</b> [...] "Everything except my love! Are you mad?" ...|$|R
60|$|The faint {{bitterness}} of her <b>tone</b> <b>troubled</b> him. There was deliberation, too, in her words. Instinctively {{he knew that}} this was no idle speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help it," [...] said Clym, in a <b>troubled</b> <b>tone.</b> [...] "Mother, I {{hate the}} flashy business. Talk about men who deserve the name, can any man deserving the name waste {{his time in}} that effeminate way, when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of {{somebody}} to buckle to and {{teach them how to}} breast the misery they are born to? I get up every morning and see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain, as St. Paul says, and yet there am I, trafficking in glittering splendours with wealthy women and titled libertines, and pandering to the meanest vanities--I, who have health and strength enough for anything. I have been troubled in my mind about it all the year, and the end is that I cannot do it any more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mysterium Fidei {{was issued}} {{just as the}} closing session of the Second Vatican Council was beginning. Written in a stern and <b>troubled</b> <b>tone,</b> its purpose was to counter certain {{theological}} movements which he perceived were gaining ground in the Roman Catholic Church. Using terminology such as [...] "pastoral concern" [...] and [...] "anxiety", the letter sends a direct and unequivocal message to the Church regarding the Eucharist. The Pope clearly feared that these novel teachings were threatening the Eucharistic piety which had marked the Catholic Church since the earliest centuries. To emphasize {{the centrality of the}} Eucharist in the Church, the Pope echoed the words of St. Ignatius of Antioch, referring to the Blessed Sacrament the [...] "medicine of immortality". The Pope acknowledged that there were many [...] "real" [...] presences of Christ, but that in the Communion bread this presence is real and [...] "substantial".|$|R
60|$|There {{was trouble}} in Seaman's face {{as the two}} men {{made their way to the}} front of the house and <b>trouble</b> in his <b>tone</b> as he {{answered}} his companion's query.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot imagine why," [...] she answered, with an undernote of <b>trouble</b> in her <b>tone.</b> [...] "Remember {{the advice}} I gave you before. No good can come of any {{friendship}} between {{my father and}} you." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, {{he moved}} to Mornant in the Monts du Lyonnais, where he wrote Septentrion, a work accused of being pornographic, and which was {{consequently}} censored and banned from being sold. It was reprinted only twenty years later, on the initiative of Gérard Bourgadier at Éditions Denoël, a French publishing house. In this largely autobiographical and erotic novel, Calaferte uses first-person narrative to recount the wanderings of a novice writer, his time spent secretly reading {{while working as a}} laborer (as a child, the protagonist would hide in public toilets, reading there very happily), and his encounters with women. The most important female figure in the novel is without a doubt Nora, a Dutch woman who represents female emancipation and social success. Calaferte continued to regularly publish collections of poems and stories of an intimate and sensual nature some of these were dreamlike and strange, and they were often linked to childhood. His plays explored the theme of family relations, using both a humorous and <b>troubling</b> <b>tone.</b> According to director Patrick Pelloquet, “ Louis Calaferte’s characters are more of a stereotype for certain behavior than characters in the strictest sense of the word”.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy shrank from {{telling her}} that he had been dismissed; and, after all, that was a {{comparatively}} small part of his <b>trouble.</b> The girl’s <b>tone</b> was gentle, and there was in her eyes a sympathy that set his heart beating. He wished he were a rich man, or, indeed, almost anything except a steamboat officer who would soon be turned out of his ship.|$|R
60|$|Some odd note in her <b>tone</b> <b>troubled</b> me, and I {{glanced at}} her quickly. She was a {{constant}} wonder and puzzle to me. After {{that night at the}} theatre my hopes had risen for the hundredth time, but I had gone to Prince George Street on the morrow to meet another rebuff--and Fitzhugh. So I had learned to interpret her by other means than words, and now her mood seemed reckless rather than merry.|$|R
5000|$|Shyamalan {{admitted}} that he had <b>trouble</b> keeping the <b>tone</b> for the film consistent during the editing phase, telling Bloody Disgusting that the first cut of the film resembled an art house film more than a horror film. A second cut went in the opposite direction and the film became a comedy. He eventually struck a middle balance and cut the film as a thriller, which, according to him, helped tie the different elements together as they [...] "could stay in service of the movie".|$|R

50|$|The series {{revolves}} around two Los Angeles private detectives, both former government secret agents: Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., played Stuart ("Stu") Bailey, a character Huggins had originated in his 1946 novel The Double Take (which he later adapted into the 1948 movie I Love <b>Trouble,</b> starring Franchot <b>Tone</b> in the role). Roger Smith played Jeff Spencer, {{also a former}} government agent, and a nonpracticing attorney. The duo worked out of a stylish office at 77 Sunset Boulevard (colloquially known as Sunset Strip), between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road {{on the south side}} of the strip next door to Dean Martin's real-life lounge, Dino's Lodge. Suzanne, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by Jacqueline Beer, handled the phones.|$|R
5000|$|In {{line with}} the {{anthology}} he envisioned, Smith penned a Preface in 1934 that was a manifesto of modernism and a rejection of all that had gone before. In Canadian poetry, he mocked, [...] "The most popular experience is to be pained, hurt, stabbed or seared by beauty—preferably by the yellow flame of a crocus in the spring or the red flame of a maple leaf in the autumn." [...] "The fundamental criticism that must be brought against Canadian poetry as a whole," [...] he added, [...] "is that it ignores the intelligence. And as a result it is dead." [...] Scott had <b>trouble</b> reconciling that <b>tone</b> with the anthology he planned. [...] "You {{will have to be}} careful not to make claims for a greater radicalism than this volume will show,” he warned Smith.|$|R
