50|$|To make {{powered flight}} possible, bats had to evolve several features. Bat flight necessitated the {{increase}} of membrane surface area between the digits of the forelimbs, between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, and between the hindlimbs. Bats also had to evolve a thinner cortical bone to reduce <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> produced by propulsive downstroke movements. Bats had to reroute innervation to their wing muscles to allow for control of powered flight. The strength and mass of forelimb musculature also had to be increased to allow powerful upstrokes and downstrokes.|$|E

50|$|Iguanodontids are low-browsing herbivores {{that fed}} {{extensively}} on gymnosperms like ferns and horsetails, {{especially during the}} early Cretaceous period. These dinosaurs were very effective as herbivores {{due in part to}} their combination of bilateral dental occlusion with the transverse power stroke of their chewing mechanism. Additionally, iguanodontids lack a rigid secondary palate, which helps to mitigate <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> during occlusion, a feature that enhanced their ability to break down plant matter. Additionally, the iguanodontids co-evolved with the radiation of angiosperms in the Cretaceous period. Angiosperms typically develop more rapidly and lower to the ground than gymnosperms; their proliferation provided a wealth of easily accessible food for the members of Iguanodontidae.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the in vitro <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> {{characteristics}} of Twisted Files (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) with two milled files of similar cross section, EndoSequence (Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA) and ProFile Vortex (DENTSPLY Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK). Files of size 25 /. 06 and 30 /. 06 from the three file types were compared (n= 20 /group). <b>Torsional</b> <b>stress</b> resistance was evaluated by measuring the torque in gram-centimeters (g-cm) and angle of rotation (degrees) required for instrument separation with use of a torsiometer instrument. The fractured files were examined using SEM to look at deformation and fracture surface characteristics. The data was analyzed with ANOVA to determine statistical differences. The three file types showed a statistically significant difference in both maximum <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> and angle of rotation prior to failure. Twisted Files displayed the least amount of <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> resistance and the highest angle of rotation. The 30 /. 06 size files of all three types withstood more <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> than the size 25 / 06 files of the same type. Within each file design, there was not a statistically significant difference in angular rotation between the 25 /. 06 and 30 /. 06 groups. The SEM analysis of all three file types revealed dimpling near the center of rotation on the fractured surface indicative of <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> The novel techniques used in manufacturing Twisted Files do not make them more resistant to <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> as compared with milled nickel-titanium endodontic files of similar cross-sectional design...|$|R

50|$|Megafaunal wolves {{were similar}} in {{physical}} size to other Pleistocene-era wolves and large extant gray wolves, but with stronger jaws and teeth. They tended to have short, broad palates with large carnassials relative to their overall skull size. These features suggest a wolf adapted for producing relatively large bite forces. The short, broad rostrum increased the mechanical advantage of a bite made with the canine teeth and strengthened the skull against <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by struggling prey. Relatively deep jaws are characteristic of habitual bone crackers, such as spotted hyenas, as well as canids that take prey as large as or larger than themselves. Overall, these features indicate that megafaunal wolves were more specialized than modern gray wolves in killing and consuming relatively large prey, and scavenging.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 3 had an {{additional}} 32 ft midsection that {{gave it a}} length of 192 ft and a displacement of 640 tons. Even with this extra weight, the vessel was slightly faster than the Mark 1. The Mk.3 was accepted on 8 April 1941, and was prefabricated in five sections. The increase in length allowed it to carry five 40-ton tanks and all their related support equipment, or 300 tons of deck cargo. Though the Royal Navy appreciated the higher load capacity of the Mk.3, it soon discovered several construction deficiencies. The craft had evidently been pressed into service without sufficient testing; combat operations demonstrated the need to add longitudinal stiffeners to the Mk.3s (and later the Mk.4s) {{in order to avoid}} <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> to the hull.

The 300SLR was the final development of the Alfa Romeo design of the early 1930s as not only the camshaft, but now also the gearbox was driven from the engine's centre. Engineers calculated that <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> would be too high if they took power {{from the end of}} the long crankshaft, so they put a central gear train in the middle (which also ran the dual camshafts, dual magnetos, and other accessories) and ran a drive shaft to the clutch housing at the rear.|$|E

Previous estimates of the rotational drag have, however, neglected the role of small natural bends in the helix backbone. We showhow these bends can increase the drag several thousandfold relative to prior estimates, allowing signi#cant <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> even in linear, unanchored DNA.

50|$|Another of George White's {{companies}} was the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Russell {{joined the}} company in May 1925, at age 21, as an assistant in the stress office. He met Miss Lorna Mansfield, a secretary at the company, and they were married for over 50 years. One of his first efforts at the company were stress calculations for the Type 99 Badminton, a biplane racer being built for the 1926 King's Cup. The Badminton crashed {{a month before the}} race, which gravely concerned Russell until the reason was revealed to be a seized engine. Another early design was the Type 95 Bagshot, a twin-engine monoplane fighter. Russell was invited to take a flight in the Bagshot, and was alarmed to see the wings twisting during control use, a problem that led to the abandoning of the design. He developed a new method of separately calculating bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses,</b> which later led to a new single-spar monoplane wing design that was granted a patent.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} {{frequently}} encountered in rotating machinery where a bending moment {{is applied to}} a rotating part. This is called a cyclic bending stress and the aerial lift above is a good example. However, cyclic axial stresses and cyclic <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> also exist. An example of cyclic axial stress would be a bungee cord (see bungee jumping), which must support the mass of people as they jump off structures such as bridges. When a person reaches {{the end of a}} cord, the cord deflects elastically and stops the person's descent. This creates a large axial stress in the cord. A fraction of the elastic potential energy stored in the cord is typically transferred back to the person, throwing the person upwards some fraction of the distance he or she fell. The person then falls on the cord again, inducing stress in the cord. This happens multiple times per jump. The same cord is used for several jumps, creating cyclical stresses in the cord that could eventually cause failure if not replaced.|$|E
50|$|The diets of bats {{are remarkably}} diverse, ranging from species specializing on fruit, blood, insects, nectar and invertebrates. Within {{the context of}} phylogenetic history, the diets of bats {{determine}} {{the structure of the}} dentary. When comparing the cross sectional shape of the dentary of frugivorous bats to nectarivorous bats, the data illustrates that the dentary of frugivores has an increased resistance to bending and torsion. These results confirm the predictions made by researches based on data collected on the diets of bats and inferred phylogenetic history. Frugivorous bats possess a feeding strategy that requires a strong dentary due to their extended periods of chewing and frequent unilateral biting during feeding, which imposes increased <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> on the dentary. Conversely, nectarivores rely on their tongue during feeding, resulting in less stress on the dentary. Research has revealed that there is {{no significant difference in the}} bite forces of insectivorous bats compared to frugivorous bats. However, observations have noted that insectivore bats have different feeding behaviors than frugivores, particularly that they do not engage in prolonged periods of unilateral feeding. Pertaining to dental characteristics, Ariteus flavescens has a metaconid on m1 and lacks a M3.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNegatively twisted DNA is {{essential}} to many biological functions. Due to <b>torsional</b> <b>stress,</b> duplex DNA can have local, sequence-dependent structural defects. In this work, a thermodynamic model of DNA was built to qualitatively predict the local sequence-dependent mechanical instabilities under <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> The results were compared to both simulation of a coarse-grained model and experiment results. By using the Kirkwood superposition approximation, we built an analytical model to represent the free energy difference ΔW of a hydrogen-bonded basepair between the B-form helical state and the basepair opened (or locally melted) state, within a given sequence under <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> We showed that ΔW can be well approximated by two-body interactions with its nearest-sequence-neighbor basepairs plus a free energy correction due to long-range correlations. This model is capable of rapidly predicting the position and thermodynamics of local defects in a given sequence. The result qualitatively matches with an in vitro experiment for a long DNA sequence (> 4000 basepairs). The 12 parameters used in this model can be further quantitatively refined when more experimental data are available...|$|R
