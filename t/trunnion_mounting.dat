50|$|In {{full-size}} engines, {{the steam}} and exhaust ports are usually {{built into the}} pivot (<b>trunnion)</b> <b>mounting.</b> However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the cutoff timing to be varied to enable expansive working, as in, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen. Alternatively, expansive working can also be provided by means of Woolf compounding, just as compactly if the two expansion stages are provided {{on either side of}} a single piston within a single cylinder, all arranged as a trunk engine (however, an oscillating cylinder engine does not benefit from the advantage of compactness that a trunk engine would otherwise provide, as it has that already from its own design features). Each approach to expansive working compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E

50|$|Pivot mounts —Absorb {{force on}} the {{cylinder}} centerline and let the cylinder change alignment in one plane. Common types include clevises, <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> and spherical bearings. Because these mounts allow a cylinder to pivot, they should be used with rod-end attachments that also pivot. Clevis mounts {{can be used in}} any orientation and are generally recommended for short strokes and small- to medium-bore cylinders.|$|R
40|$|A {{subcritical}} {{liquid hydrogen}} orbital storage and transfer experiment {{was designed for}} flight in the Shuttle cargo bay. The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported in a vacuum jacket by two fiberglass epoxy <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts.</b> This composite material was selected for the trunnions since it provides desirable strength, weight and thermal characteristics for supporting cryogenic tankage. An experimental program was conducted to provide material property and fatigue data for S-glass epoxy composite materials at ambient and liquid hydrogen temperatures and to verify structural integrity of the CFME trunnion supports...|$|R

2500|$|The Austro-Hungarian Army {{was very}} pleased with its large siege howitzers like the 42 cm Haubitze M. 14/16, {{but they were all}} short-ranged. The Army asked Škoda to design a gun able to destroy {{important}} targets deep in the enemy's rear in 1916. To save time and resources, it was designed in concert with the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16 and used the same carriage and firing platform as the larger weapon. The gun used the forward <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> on the carriage, while the howitzer used the rear ones. Some sources claim that the gun was adapted from Škoda's 1901 naval gun of the same calibre and length, but this is wrong because the M. 16 gun weighed almost [...] less than the older naval gun.|$|R
50|$|Mks I, VI and VII were coast defence {{versions}} with <b>trunnions</b> for <b>mounting</b> on recoil slides. They {{were installed}} in forts in England at Spitbank Fort, No Man's Land Fort and Horse Sand Fort from 1884 onward {{and were in}} active service during World War I.|$|R

The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported {{in a vacuum}} jacket by two fiberglass epoxy composite <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts.</b> The ability of the CFME to last for the required seven missions depends primarily on the fatigue life of the composite trunnions at cryogenic temperatures.

50|$|The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94 {{was a heavy}} {{howitzer}} used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had {{a bronze}} barrel and relied on wheel ramps to absorb its recoil. The barrel was modified in 1899 as the M 99 and can be identified by its octagonal shape. Both howitzers could be mounted {{on a wide variety}} of carriages to suit their mission, including a carriage only 1.13 m wide for mountain use. Around the start of the 20th century both the M 94 and M 99 were modified to increase their elevation up to 65°. The elevation arc had to be extended and the <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> and wheels had to be strengthened to withstand the greater recoil forces when firing at high elevation. They were known as the M 94/4 and the M 99/4 after modification.|$|R
50|$|Gun {{carriages}} {{were introduced}} in the 15th century. Two large-diameter wheels, axle-tree and a trail became the standard pattern for field use. The barrel was mounted in a wooden cradle with <b>trunnions</b> to <b>mount</b> it on the carriage. As technology improved, the trunnions {{became part of the}} barrel and the cradle was abandoned. Nevertheless, they were relatively large and heavy.|$|R
50|$|A 52 {{cubic meter}} pit {{had to be}} {{excavated}} to hold the firing platform which took eight to twenty hours, depending on soil conditions. The bedding halves then were winched into position on rails and jacked down into the pit. The carriage was then mounted on the bedding and the barrel mated to it. All this took six to eight hours to prepare for firing. A small tilting crane was mounted {{on the left side}} of the turntable to move shells from their transport carts to the loading tray. It was also used to assemble the loading tray and to change the breech. The howitzer could only be loaded at 11° elevation because the shells had to be rammed by a hand-powered winch with pushrod. The eight later weapons used the same carriage as the 24 cm Kanone M. 16; it had <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> for both types and the gun used the forward mounts while the howitzer used the rear ones.|$|R
50|$|The Semovente da 149/40 was a {{completely}} unprotected weapon as the long gun barrel was placed on an open mounting carried on the turretless tank chassis. The gun crew stood in the open to serve the gun that had its <b>trunnions</b> <b>mounted</b> right to the rear to absorb some of the recoil forces produced on firing. It was late 1942 before the first prototype was ready for prolonged firing trials, but even before these were over unsuccessful attempts were being made to start production. Before the lines could start rolling the Italians surrendered to the Allies and the Germans took over {{what was left of}} the Italian economy. Thus the Semovente da 149/40 prototype remained the sole example of what seemed to be a promising design. The Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 could fire a 46 kg shell to a range of 23700 m, at which distance the lack of protection for the gun crew would have been of relatively little importance.|$|R

50|$|Greenamyer {{built the}} Starfighter by {{collecting}} and putting together myriad parts over a 13-year period. The cockpit side panels and some control column bearings of the Red Baron {{came from the}} very first production F-104A, which crashed in Palmdale, California 22 years earlier. The tail of the Red Baron, minus stabilizers, came from a junkyard in Ontario, California. The stabilizers and some nose wheel parts were from scrap piles in Tucson and Homestead, Florida. The idler arm for the elevator controls, the ejection seat rails and some electrical relays came from an F-104 that crashed and burned at Edwards Air Force Base {{on the edge of the}} Mojave Desert. Greenamyer got his throttle quadrant from a Tennessee flying buff he met at the Reno Air Races. The <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> for the nose gear, some of the cooling-system valves and a few relays on the Red Baron came from a 25-ton pile of junk that Greenamyer bought at Eglin Air Force Base. In a swap with NASA, he obtained the nose of a Lockheed NF-104A, with its reaction controls. The all-important J79-GE-10 engine was obtained from the US Navy.|$|R

50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} (also {{known as a}} wobbler in the US) is a simple steam-engine design that requires no valve gear. Instead the cylinder rocks, or oscillates, as the crank-shaft moves the piston, pivoting in the <b>mounting</b> <b>trunnion</b> so that ports in the cylinder line up with ports in a fixed port face alternately to direct steam into {{or out of the}} cylinder.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trunnions</b> were <b>mounted</b> {{near the}} center of mass to allow the barrel to be {{elevated}} to any desired angle, without having to dismount it from the carriage upon which it rested. Some guns had a second set of trunnions placed several feet back from the first pair, which could be used to allow for easier transportation. The gun would recoil causing the carriage to move backwards several feet but men or a team of horses could put it back into firing position. It became easier to rapidly transport these large siege guns, maneuver them from transportation mode to firing position, and they could go wherever a team of men or horses could pull them.|$|R
5000|$|The Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Saint-Chamond was a {{howitzer}} {{of relatively}} advanced design for its time. It used a hydro-spring recoil system mounted below the barrel {{and had a}} small gun shield. The box carriage had wooden wheels so {{it could only be}} towed as a single load at low speeds by vehicles or by a team of 8 horses The barrel was drawn back over the trail for towing. It had a semi-automatic vertical sliding block breech that ejected the cartridge case after firing. A loading tray was attached to the carriage on a swinging mount. It fired a 43.5 kg high-explosive (Obus FA Mle 1915) shell to a range of 9300 m. The ammunition was [...] "semi-fixed" [...] the propellent was packaged in small bags in a brass cartridge and the total propellent charge could be adjusted by changing the number of bags. The Saint-Chamond howitzer was unique among French guns in that it had rear-positioned trunnions. The advantage of rear-positionedtrunnions is that the breech doesn't [...] "disappear" [...] into a box trail {{as is the case with}} <b>trunnions</b> <b>mounted</b> at the centre of gravity of the barrel and receiver. This means that the howitzer can be loaded at high elevation angles since the breech position does not change significantly throughout the elevation range. The disadvantage of rear-positioned trunnions is that the elevation system must be more robustsince it must bear greater forces from the barrel weight. To reduce the forces on the elevation gearing an equilibrator is necessary, this is usually a spring, or in the case of the Saint-Chamond a pneumaticsystem. The Saint-Chamond elevation system also moved the gun shield along with the barrel which meant that the gun shield could be smaller than a fixed gun shield. The traverse system was similar to that of other French guns, a worm gear moved the carriage across the axle.|$|R
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} is {{a variant of}} the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam {{into and out of the}} cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot <b>mounting</b> (<b>trunnion).</b> These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.|$|R
50|$|The M27 {{recoilless}} rifle was a 105-mm weapon {{developed in the}} early 1950s and fielded in the Korean War. Although a {{recoilless rifle}} of this caliber had been a concept since the Second World War, the weapon was hurriedly produced {{with the onset of}} the Korean War. The speed with which it was developed and fielded resulted in problems with reliability caused by <b>trunnions</b> that were <b>mounted</b> too far to the rear. The M27 was also considered too heavy by the U.S. Army and had a disappointing effective range {{due to the lack of}} a spotting rifle. Taking the M27 as the basis for a new design, the Army developed an improved version of the M27 that was type-designated the M40 106-mm recoilless rifle in 1955. Originally, along with its type-designation, it was also given the official name BAT for Battalion Anti-Tank gun, but that was soon dropped.. Although unsuitable for military purposes, M27 recoilless rifles were used to trigger controlled avalanches at ski resorts and mountain passes in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The steam {{needs to}} be fed into {{the end of the}} {{cylinder}} {{at just the right time}} in the cycle to push the piston in the correct direction. In the other direction, the steam {{needs to be}} allowed to escape from the cylinder. As the crankshaft rotates, the piston rod moves up and down (or side to side in the case of a vertical cylinder) as well as in and out. Because the piston rod is rigid and the piston itself is long relative to its diameter, this causes the cylinder to rock, or [...] "oscillate" [...] on its special <b>mounting</b> (<b>trunnion).</b> In the design usually found in a toy or model engine, a hole in the side of the cylinder (one at each end for a double-acting cylinder) and a pair of holes in the port block are arranged so that this rocking motion lines up the holes at the correct times, allowing steam to enter the cylinder in one direction and to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in the other direction.|$|R
