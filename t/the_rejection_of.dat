5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the script, Roddenberry {{planned to}} convert his {{treatment}} into a novel.

Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned.

5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> certain principles, such as {{deception}} and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teachers}} at Sabha were Egyptian, {{and for the}} first time Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, Philosophy of the Revolution, which outlined how to initiate a coup.|$|E

Candy deals with <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> a sort of optimism which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; Candy also parodies pornography and popular psychology.

5|$|Pezuela was deposed by a military-liberal coup, and José de la Serna e Hinojosa {{became the}} new viceroy. De la Serna called San Martín to {{negotiate}} {{an end of}} hostilities. The result was the same than with Pezuela: De la Serna proposed to enact the 1812 Spanish constitution (Perú inside Spain), and San Martín demanded the independence of Peru (with an independent monarchy). <b>The</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish constitution was motivated by the disproportional representation of the Americas in the Constituent Assembly that wrote it.

5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E

Though {{it was believed that}} Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan.

Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} forms and structures for poetry {{that began in}} the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-{{traditional forms}} or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{composite}} nanofiltration membranes were prepared via a method of coating and cross-linking from sulfated chitosan (SCS) as the material of the active layer, Polysulfone (PS) UF membrane as the base membrane, and epichlorohydrin (ECH) as the cross-linker. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were employed to characterize the resultant composite membrane. The effects of the operating conditions on <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite membrane were investigated, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting membrane to Na 2 SO 4 and NaCl solutions (1000 mg·L - 1) were 90. 8 and 32. 5 % at 0. 40 MPa and 15 °C, while the permeate fluxes were 22. 9 and 58. 4 kg·m - 2 ·h - 1 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> this kind of membrane to the electrolyte solutions decreased {{in the order of}} Na 2 SO 4, NaCl, MgSO 4, and MgCl 2.

5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992.
