5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers, because they {{went beyond the}} war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there.

25|$|Dealing {{with the}} Prize, Bunin donated 100,000 francs to a {{literary}} charity fund, {{but the process}} of money distribution caused controversy among his fellow Russian émigré writers.

Although reluctant {{to become involved in}} politics, Bunin was now feted as both a writer and the embodiment of non-Bolshevik Russian values and traditions.
