40|$|Calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> are {{structures}} that mediate one step in excitation-contraction (e–c) 1 coupling in muscle cells: the rapid release of calcium from internal stores {{in response to}} depolarization of the exterior membranes (Franzini-Armstrong and Jorgensen, 1994; Flucher and Franzini-Armstrong, 1996). Calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> are formed by apposed junctional domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) on one side, and of exterior membranes (plasma membrane and transverse tubules) on the other.

40|$|A {{model for}} the flow of calcium {{on the scale of}} one heart cell is given by a system of {{time-dependent}} reaction-diffusion equations coupled by nonlinear reaction terms. Calcium ions enter into the cell at <b>release</b> <b>units</b> distributed throughout the cell and then diffuse. At each <b>release</b> <b>unit,</b> the probability for calcium to be released increases along with the concentration of calcium, thus creating a feedback loop of waves regenerating themselves repeatedly. The validation of this model requires simulations on the time scale of several repeated waves and on the spatial scale of the entire cell. This requires long-time studies on spatial meshes that need to have a high resolution to resolve the positions of the calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> throughout the entire cell. We detail the development of a special-purpose numerical method and parallel implementation for this problem. Parallel performance studies demonstrate the scalability of the implementation on a distributed-memory cluster with low-latency interconnect. Convergence studies verify convergence to analytical expectations and confirm the appropriateness of all numerical parameters. Application studies on the desired time and length scales confirm that the model exhibits the desired feedback mechanism for calcium currents through the <b>release</b> <b>units</b> at suitable high levels, but the long-time studies demonstrate also that the current model with its present parameters leads to excessive calcium concentrations over time. This phenomenon could only be observed using a computational method able to reach laboratory scale final times for a domain on the scale of a complete cell...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In muscle cells, excitation–contraction (e–c) {{coupling}} {{is mediated}} by “calcium <b>release</b> <b>units,</b> ” junctions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and exterior membranes. Two proteins, which face each other, {{are known to}} functionally interact in those structures: the ryanodine receptors (RyRs), or SR calcium release channels, and the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), or L-type calcium channels of exterior membranes. In skeletal muscle, DHPRs form tetrads, groups of four receptors, and tetrads are organized in arrays that face arrays of feet (or RyRs). Triadin is a protein of the SR located at the SR–exterior membrane junctions, whose role is not known. We have structurally characterized calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> in a skeletal muscle cell line (1 B 5) lacking Ry 1 R. Using immunohistochemistry and freezefractur...|$|R

40|$|Calcium release during excitation-contraction {{coupling}} of {{skeletal muscle}} cells is {{initiated by the}} functional interaction of the exterior membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mediated by the "mechanical" coupling of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR). RyR is the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) release channel and DHPR is an L-type calcium channel of exterior membranes (surface membrane and T tubules), which acts as the voltage sensor of excitation-contraction coupling. The two proteins {{communicate with each other}} at junctions between SR and exterior membranes called calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> and are associated with several proteins of which triadin and calsequestrin are the best characterized. Calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> are present in diaphragm muscles and hind limb derived primary cultures of double knock out mice lacking both DHPR and RyR. The junctions show coupling between exterior membranes and SR, and an apparently normal content and disposition of triadin and calsequestrin. Therefore SR-surface docking, targeting of triadin and calsequestrin to the junctional SR domains and the structural organization of the two latter proteins are not affected by lack of DHPR and RyR. Interestingly, simultaneous lack of the two major excitation-contraction coupling proteins results in decrease of calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> frequency in the diaphragm, compared with either single knockout mutation...|$|R

30|$|Central to oxygen {{consumption}} calorimetry is the empirical {{observation that the}} heat <b>released</b> per <b>unit</b> of oxygen consumed is approximately constant (Steckler 2000). Parker (1977) recognized this empirical fact and tabulated the heat <b>release</b> per <b>unit</b> oxygen consumed for 17 fuels. Huggett (1978, 1980) made a more rigorous study of the variations in heat <b>release</b> per <b>unit</b> oxygen consumed over {{a wider range of}} fuels and over a range of combustion conditions. He recognized that the concept itself had been discovered by Thornton (1917). His work established the heat <b>release</b> per <b>unit</b> oxygen consumed as 13.1  kJ/g of oxygen ± 5 %. Huggett’s paper provided a strong foundation for {{oxygen consumption}} calorimetry which gave the fire research community the confidence to move forward with developing it as a measurement methodology. The constancy of the heat released per oxygen consumed was also discussed by Babrauskas (1976) in his PhD work on fully developed compartment fires.|$|R
