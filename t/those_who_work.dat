5|$|Carrick Post Office {{opened on}} 5 November 1841. Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a residential settlement for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a sewerage plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E

In this study, the sample of 65 companies has been drawn randomly from Amman, Zarka and Irbid in the electronic industry in Jordan.

5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{ascertain}} {{the effects of}} overtime and psychosocial job conditions on the occurrence of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in Japan. DESIGN: An eight year prospective cohort study. SETTING: An electrical company in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: In 1984, a mailed questionnaire was sent to industrial workers of an electrical company in Japan. After excluding <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{had a history of}} diabetes mellitus or other chronic diseases, 2597 male respondents were prospectively followed up for the succeeding eight years. Data from 2194 (84 %) who were completely followed up were analysed. The occurrence of NIDDM during the follow up period was assessed according to the WHO criteria on the basis of an annual screening programme. MAIN RESULTS: The age adjusted incidence of NIDDM was significantly higher in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> overtime more than 50 hours per month than in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> 25 hours or less per month (p < 0. 05). It was significantly higher in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> with new technology at baseline than in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not (p < 0. 05). Cox's proportional hazard model indicated that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> overtime more than 50 hours per month had 3. 7 times higher risk of NIDDM after controlling for known risk factors (p < 0. 01) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> with new technology had 2. 4 times higher risk of NIDDM (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that longer overtime and use of new technology are risk factors of NIDDM in Japanese men...|$|R
