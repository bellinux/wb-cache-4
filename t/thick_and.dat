5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> has resulted in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|Its spores are spherical, {{measuring}} 8–13µm, {{and have}} a surface of irregular, coarse warts. The capillitium refers to late-maturing, thick-walled cells in the gleba. The main axes of these branched cells are 20–30µm <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> they are covered with numerous spines.|$|E

5|$|The {{church of}} Maribojoc resembled a cross or {{cruciform}} with a low, four-sided pyramidical roof and octagonal cupola. Walls were consistently divided into <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> thin portions designed with finely cut coral stones on the sides.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic pastel / crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are {{noticeable}} — water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects {{are not as}} <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> the backgrounds are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on those of the SNES game.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E

60|$|But the {{conflagration}} {{had gained}} considerable headway, and some cans of paints and oils added ready {{fuel to the}} blaze. The smoke grew <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicker,</b> <b>and</b> presently a tongue of flame shot skyward.|$|R
60|$|The dust grew <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicker,</b> <b>and</b> the throats {{and eyes}} and noses of the invaders {{were filled with}} it. But not one halted or turned back. They hurried forward more fierce and vengeful than ever.|$|R
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{divide the}} iron-bearing rocks {{of the eastern}} Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty and Lower Cherty. Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above. The slate is from 50 to several hundred feet <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> the four iron-bearing layers are from 400 to 600 feet thick.|$|E
60|$|So {{the little}} folks blessed the snow-storm, and {{were glad to}} see it come <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicker,</b> <b>and</b> watched {{hopefully}} the long drift that was piling itself up in the avenue, and was already higher than any of their heads.|$|R
60|$|The {{snow was}} falling in <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicker</b> flakes, <b>and</b> already the vicarage-garden was cloaked in white {{as he passed}} through the gate. Mrs. Barton heard him open the door, {{and ran out of}} the sitting-room to meet him.|$|R

5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While {{grooming}} is not difficult, breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{feature of the}} building is the dome, which rises 25.3 meters (83ft) from the ground, and has an outer diameter of 27.7 meters (91ft). The dome structure is layered, with an outer waterproofed casing of reinforced concrete 4 centimeters (2.5inches) <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> an inner concrete dome that is insulated by a layer of urethane foam.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the amount of food and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|The main conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on its sides {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> the second one and a half inches thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> it had a 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck. The walls of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|E

5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} is <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales {{known as}} scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 7.5–9.5 by 5.5–6.5 by 4.5–5.5μm, averaging 8.7 by 6.0 by 5.3μm. Its shape in face view is ovate (egg-shaped) to roughly rhomboid, while {{viewed from the}} side it appears elliptical. The spore wall is brown, smooth, about 0.8–1μm <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> has a germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and somewhat club-shaped, tapering slightly to the base; they are clamped, and measure 25–31 by 7–8.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} is a butterfly-shaped organ that {{sits at the}} front of the neck. It is {{composed}} of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow isthmus. The thyroid weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5cm long, 3cm wide and 2cm <b>thick,</b> <b>and</b> the isthmus about 1.25cm in height and width. The gland is usually larger in women, and increases in size in pregnancy.|$|E
