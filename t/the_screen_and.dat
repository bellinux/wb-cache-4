40|$|<b>The</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{quantitative}} π-model {{description of}} the optical spectra and polarizations of phenyl based oligomers were discussed. The complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO) model was presented, which is able to predict the energies and symmetries of all the observed optical transitions of benzene, biphenyl <b>and</b> trans-stilbene. <b>The</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ordering of dipole allowed transitions was accounted within a π electron only model by using a dieletric constant and an appropriate parameter renormalization...|$|R
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E
5|$|In Pest Control, the player's {{vision is}} limited to a small area of the screen around the Accu-Sight {{crosshairs}} while looking for cockroaches that attempt to eat an on-screen pizza. Two different power-ups briefly illuminate <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> clear all bugs onscreen. Later levels feature larger insects that contain bombs and small, fast bugs.|$|E
5|$|Less than an {{hour later}} the post was photographed off <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with {{a photo of the}} framed quote. Later the user, after {{endorsement}} by other anonymous users in the thread, created an auction on eBay for the framed photo which quickly rose to high prices, culminating in a price of $90,900.00.|$|E
50|$|Self-{{rating scale}}s, {{such as the}} ADHD rating scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD {{diagnostic}} rating scale are used in <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> evaluation of ADHD.|$|R
50|$|The MicroTiles {{system has}} design {{features}} for simple installation and setup that minimise {{the need for}} detailed configuration of <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> display controller.|$|R
50|$|Ahmet Çakar, {{a member}} of Parliament from the MHP, was outraged at <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> {{believed}} it is indecent and unacceptable {{under the guidance of}} nationalism.|$|R
5|$|Screenshots of Zelda: Gaiden {{released}} in August 1999 show unmistakable {{elements of the}} final version of Majora's Mask, such as the large clock that dominates the center of Clock Town, the timer at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> the Goron Mask. Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the story concept as well as the use of transformation masks were already in place.|$|E
5|$|Shadowrun is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor {{of the original}} tabletop game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> sturdy unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components {{as compared to the}} original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.|$|E

50|$|Buon {{cautions}} {{that this is}} an uneasy dichotomy and that it is probable that in every case, to some extent, <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> investment effect would co-exist.|$|R
50|$|The film is {{structured}} in halves: {{the first half}} leading up to <b>the</b> <b>screening,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second half depicting <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> what goes on at and around it. The film also showed the differences in two young women who eventually become the girlfriends of the two boys. The girlfriend of Gene had progressive ideas of what a woman might become, whereas the eventual girlfriend of Stan {{was very much in}} line with what society {{at the time of the}} film's setting thought a young lady should be.|$|R
5|$|The {{book was}} adapted into a ten-minute {{animated}} short film by Leon Schlesinger Productions and released in 1942 {{as part of}} Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies series. The short was directed by Bob Clampett and {{marked the first time}} a Dr. Seuss work was adapted for <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> also the only time WB animated short was licensed to be based on pre-existing work still under copyright.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot's objective {{to defend his}} plant from interstellar space slugs. The plant grows from a pot at the bottom centre of <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> spray cans containing three different pesticides are located on ledges {{on each side of}} the screen. Bonus items such as fertiliser and spades appear on unoccupied ledges which will increase both the players score and the plant's growth rate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E
50|$|Paratrooper {{units were}} formed from volunteers, who were <b>screened</b> <b>and</b> trained at Camp Toccoa. The 517th {{was charged with}} <b>screening</b> <b>the</b> volunteers <b>and</b> {{assigning}} those qualified to either infantry, artillery or engineers. Officers of the 460th and C/139 were placed on temporary duty at Toccoa to help with <b>the</b> <b>screening,</b> <b>and</b> men assigned to those units were sent to Mackall.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{stability}} {{is an essential}} physical component for team sport athletes. Certain Functional Movement Screen (FMS) exercises (deep squat; left- and right-leg hurdle step; left- and right-leg in-line lunge [ILL]; left- and right-leg active straight-leg raise; and trunk stability push-up [TSPU]) have been suggested as providing an indication of dynamic stability. No research has investigated relationships between these <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> an established test of dynamic stability such as the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT), which measures lower-limb reach distance in posteromedial, medial, and anteromedial directions, in team sport athletes. Forty-one male and female team sport athletes completed <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mSEBT. Participants were split into high-, intermediate-, and low-performing groups according to {{the mean of the}} excursions when both the left and right legs were used for the mSEBT stance. Any between-group differences in <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> mSEBT were determined via a one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc adjustment (p < 0. 05). Data was pooled for a correlation analysis (p < 0. 05). There were no between-group differences in any of <b>the</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>and</b> only two positive correlations between <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mSEBT (TSPU and right stance leg posteromedial excursion, r = 0. 37; left-leg ILL and left stance leg posteromedial excursion, r = 0. 46). The mSEBT clearly indicated participants with different dynamic stability capabilities. In contrast to the mSEBT, the selected FMS exercises investigated in this study have a limited capacity to identify dynamic stability in team sport athletes...|$|R
30|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of wastewater from <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> <b>and</b> primary settling tanks was observed to reduce by 17.89 and 7.95 %, respectively, after 30 -day retention {{period in the}} pilot VFCW.|$|R
5|$|Aguilera {{then takes}} a touch screen Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone {{from her pocket}} with {{an image of a}} futuristic blue haired character, after {{producing}} a scene of a convertible car, she inputs the character from the phone onto <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> into the car and the blue haired character is then shown driving. Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at the desk accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E
5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information from <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game {{viewed from}} the third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is visible on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located {{off the coast of}} Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} offered which yields the net thermal {{radiation}} {{at the ground}} of a single span greenhouse fitted with thermal screens, {{in terms of the}} outside radiative environment, the properties of <b>the</b> cladding <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> surfaces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> temperatures of <b>the</b> ground, <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> covering. Radiation is assumed to be diffusely emitted, transmitted and reflected, both by <b>the</b> cladding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> surfaces. <b>The</b> importance of the geometry <b>and</b> temperature of <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> surface, <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> radiometric properties of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in determining <b>the</b> radiative environment inside are indicated. On the basis of this model, together with the outside radiation fluxes, temperature of <b>the</b> ground, <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> cover and data on the properties of <b>the</b> cladding <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> surfaces, <b>the</b> net thermal radiation inside the greenhouse can be determined, both in clear and overcast night sky conditions. These results are found to be in fairly good agreement with the measured net thermal radiation at ground level inside the greenhouse...|$|R

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton laid out the paths and driveways and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. <b>The</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>and</b> the Arch originally formed a single composition, {{designed to provide a}} monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, although the arch was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when the arch was re-sited.|$|E
