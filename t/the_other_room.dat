5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked into <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> as if I was in a tractor beam and stood {{there in front of}} the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> to get ready, her FBI badge {{falls out of}} her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of}} the bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
25|$|One of his painted rooms has {{decoration}} that evokes verdure tapestry and vignettes of Samson and Delilah, Abraham and Isaac, and David and Bathsheba and The Temptation of St. Anthony; this vaulted room is {{now called}} the Arbour Room. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> has scenes from the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Lucretia, Saint Jerome and Mary Magdalene. The original use of this suite of rooms is unknown. The subjects of these paintings allude to the Power of Women, perhaps a political reference to Mary of Guise, Mary Queen of Scots and the two Tudor Queens of England.|$|E
500|$|Unanimously {{approved}} by music critics, [...] "Almost Blue" [...] was noted {{for being a}} highlight on Imperial Bedroom; Emerick's production on the track was also singled out by reviewers, who acclaimed his [...] "aftermath" [...] approach towards its composition. The song was covered by several performers, notably Chet Baker in 1987, Gwen Stefani in 1998, and by Costello's wife Diana Krall for her seventh studio album, The Girl in <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Room</b> (2004).|$|E

500|$|He {{spent over}} 30years keeping birds and devoted two rooms {{of his house}} to swallows. [...] One room housed a cage for the swallows. [...] <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> was a {{training}} space with a balcony used for practice releases. [...] He documented the age and health of each bird in a register, and marked each one by tying a colored silk to its leg. [...] Red silk indicated a trained bird and blue silk indicated a partially trained bird. [...] Trained swallows were allowed to roam outside their cages, while the others remained caged at all times. [...] Untrained birds were sold as pets.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} Peter {{suggests}} Jerome grab his nephew and [...] "shoot {{people in the}} D.C. area" [...] {{in reference to the}} Beltway sniper attacks. Feeling sorry for Jerome, Lois invites him to stay at their home, with Peter reluctantly agreeing, before suddenly being cut off mid-sentence by the Mac OS X spinning wait cursor. The next day, after Jerome decides to cook for Lois, Peter and Chris, sitting in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room,</b> overhear Lois passionately complimenting Jerome, and believe they are having sex. Racing to the kitchen, the two discover that she was only complimenting his food, with Don Knotts as Ralph Furley from the sitcom Three's Company also appearing.|$|E
500|$|Lennon and Ono co-produced {{the song}} and album with Phil Spector, who commented on the track: [...] "We knew {{what we were going}} to do ... It was going to be John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to make sure that, when the room thermostat is calling for heat, all the radiators in the system heat up fully - to the maximum temperature possible - in sitting <b>rooms</b> and <b>other</b> daily [...] "living" [...] rooms but NOT in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> (utility rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) which should be kept as cool as possible. This is easy {{to do if you}} have TRVs (thermostatically-controlled radiator valves) fitted to your radiators but, if you don't have TRVs, you should be sure to open the IN-FLOW valves fully in all living rooms and turn them almost fully off in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> (Keeping them open just an eighth- to a quarter- turn usually works.) ...|$|R

500|$|Costello's wife, Canadian singer Diana Krall, {{recorded}} {{a cover of}} [...] "Almost Blue" [...] for her seventh studio album, The Girl in <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Room</b> (2004). Both Krall and Tommy LiPuma produced the track, which is over a minute longer than Costello's original rendition. An accompanying music video to Krall's version was created and released in 2004, and eventually uploaded onto her official Vevo account on October 6, 2009. The visual was selected by the singer to appear on her greatest hits album, The Very Best of Diana Krall, in 2007. In her review of the video's inclusion on the aforementioned album, Shackleton mentioned the [...] "wintry outdoor scenes from Diana's native Vancouver Island" [...] as a highlight.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centre}} of the first floor is the Oak Hall, {{so-called}} because of the oaks formerly growing {{on the site of the}} new hall. [...] It contains a mahogany four-flight staircase. [...] The staircase has triple ballusters, and was carved by Shillito. [...] Afain the plasterwork is by Oliver. [...] More family portraits hang on its walls and the hall's contents include a hobby horse, a man trap, and an 18th-century sedan chair. Also in the hall is a memorial display for Tabley House School. [...] <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> on the north side of the house is known as the Marble Hall. [...] This was created from Carr's original rooms in the 19th-century alterations. [...] It contains five reliefs on its wall, one of which depicts the nine muses.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
50|$|In most of Little Georgia's houses, {{one room}} {{in the front of}} the house served as a parlor (though many times it doubled as a bedroom); <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> were {{primarily}} used as bedrooms. The {{room in the}} northeast corner of the Lacy house served as the parlor for entertaining guests and is thus designed with more ornate woodwork than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three bedrooms. <b>The</b> mantle above the fireplace in this room also contains more intricate details than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms.</b> Although <b>the</b> room was used mainly to entertain guests, it has almost always doubled as a bedroom because of the large size of the Lacy family.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawing room}} is {{plastered}} and has reproduction wallpaper. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> on <b>the</b> first floor are wood paneled. There are seven bedrooms {{on the second}} floor. The four in the original section are wood paneled.|$|R

2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, [...] "I'm {{going to go in}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> and you stay here and talk to your friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a brief conversation, Polanski {{had packed}} up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive {{off in his}} car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she [...] "had {{witnessed}} nothing untoward" [...] and never saw them together in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> Gailey learned afterwards that Huston had recently broken up with Nicholson, but stopped by {{to pick up some}} belongings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> say [...] "We'll be right out." [...] Polanski then came out with Gailey and he {{introduced}} her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Gailey was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.|$|E
5000|$|The Atrium, 1200m² {{adaptable}} for receptions, posters,exhibitions, {{breaks and}} dinners is considered {{as the heart}} of the Convention Center. With a direct access to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms,</b> it is also appreciated for its design and modularity.|$|R
60|$|Hastily, {{the three}} searched. A charred {{mass in the}} grate {{indicated}} that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers {{on the eve of}} her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they searched <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to typify the relatioIl bctween family <b>rooms</b> and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> from {{comparison}} between dwellings in housing magazines and newly built detachcd housings in Fukui city. So， {{the relation between}} family <b>rooms</b> and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> has been examined in eight types. Main conclusions are as follows : 1. The composition of these eight types are greatly connected to the scale of farnily rooms. 2. The change of thc composition caused by the scale of total floor differs according to the scale of family rooms. 3. The characteristics of the composition are also different {{for the two groups}} of dwellings compared here...|$|R
2500|$|Listening to {{the backing}} track to [...] "With or Without You" [...] {{in the control}} room, Bono and Friday heard the {{sustained}} effect that the Edge was creating with the Infinite Guitar in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> The {{combination of the two}} playing simultaneously caught their attention. According to Lanois, [...] "I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus it's better than I thought.'" [...] The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording {{to be one of the}} album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.|$|E
2500|$|In the morning, Spade goes to Cairo's hotel, {{where he}} spots Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.), {{a young man}} who had been {{following}} him earlier. He gives Wilmer a message for his boss, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), the [...] "Fat Man". Spade meets Gutman, who begins to talk about the Falcon, but becomes evasive, causing Spade to storm out. Later, Wilmer takes Spade at gunpoint to see Gutman. Spade overpowers Wilmer, but meets with Gutman anyway. Gutman relates the history of the Maltese Falcon. He offers Spade $25,000 for the bird and a quarter of the proceeds from its sale. Then Spade passes out because his drink had been spiked. Wilmer, Gutman, and Cairo (who had been in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room)</b> depart.|$|E
2500|$|The quoted {{fragments}} {{are often}} chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo. For example, Berio uses a violin {{line from the}} second movement of Alban Berg's violin concerto with chromatically descending sixteenth notes two measures before a similarly descending line appears in Mahler's scherzo. This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from Johannes Brahms' violin concerto [...] The text from Beckett at this point begins, [...] "So {{after a period of}} immaculate silence there seemed", but, instead of continuing the quotation ("a feeble cry was heard by me"), Berio substitutes the words [...] "to be a violin concerto being played in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>room</b> in three quarters" [...] and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on [...] "two violin concertos", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms [...]|$|E
5|$|The room on {{the south}} side (separated by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>rooms</b> due to <b>the</b> hall's height) was {{accessed}} via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.|$|R
