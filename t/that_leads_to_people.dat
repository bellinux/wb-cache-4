50|$|An {{understanding}} of social role valorization {{can lead to}} {{ideas about how to}} improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes - firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project explores the potential utility {{of a new}} intervention approach designed to target motivation for health behaviour change. Research shows that although people may believe certain values to be important, they are often unable to articulate why {{this is the case}} (ie they lack 'cognitive support' for the value). As a result, they tend to behave in accordance with the value only when it is relatively easy to do so. However, value-consistent behaviour can be increased by asking individuals to think about reasons for and against the value. Experiments 1 and 2 of this project examine (a) the extent to which individuals lack cognitive support for the value of health, and (b) the type of information (eg feelings/thoughts/behaviours) <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> valuing health. Experiment 3 goes on to examine whether health intentions and behaviours can be influenced by providing individuals with cognitive support for the value of health and compares the effects of this strategy with other techniques known to influence intentions and/or behaviours. Finally, Experiment 4 uses the most effective strategies from Experiment 3 to form the basis of an internet-based health intervention programme, the effects of which are assessed over a six-month period...|$|E

Pairings were also rated along several dimensions of risk perception such as dangerousness, scariness, likelihood, and fairness. As hypothesized, natural hazards were consistently preferred to functionally identical artificial ones. Additionally, natural hazards tended to be considered less scary and dangerous, but not necessarily more unfair or unlikely than equivalent artificial counterparts.

Within twenty years an evangelical presence has gone from virtually non-existent to standing alongside the Catholic Church in the area’s religious landscape.

In this thesis I provide another ethnographic research context to the growing body of literature focused on Pentecostalism/evangelicalism in Latin America.

To be religiously active in the manner of my informants requires deep commitment and is not a faith adopted and practiced lightly. Those who become evangelical and sustain the demanding practice are likely to seek it for spiritual solutions to difficult life situations...|$|R
