5|$|After losing six tosses {{against his}} English {{opposite}} number Stanley Jackson during the summer, Darling {{decided on a}} different approach before the Scarborough Festival match late in the tour. At the toss, he approached Jackson stripped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> and suggested, in fun, a wrestle for choice of innings.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E
5|$|The foederati {{make their}} first {{official}} appearance on Trajan's Column, {{where they are}} portrayed in a standardised manner, with long hair and beards, barefoot, stripped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> wearing long trousers held up by wide belts and wielding clubs. In reality several different tribes supported the Romans in the Dacian wars. Their attire and weapons would have varied widely. The Column stereotypes them {{with the appearance of}} a single tribe, probably the most outlandish-looking, to differentiate them clearly from the regular auxilia. Judging by the frequency of their appearance in the Column's battle scenes, the foederati were important contributors to the Roman operations in Dacia. Another example of foederati are the 5,500 captured Sarmatian cavalrymen sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) to garrison a fort on Hadrian's Wall after their defeat in the Marcomannic Wars.|$|E
50|$|The {{trousers}} {{were made}} {{out of the same}} cotton sateen material and regular cotton twill. They were made similarly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> khaki trousers, with better design features. They also had buttoned tabs at <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> in order <b>to</b> cinch <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> in.|$|R
50|$|In principle, {{one could}} use a single {{measurement}} at <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> diameter, a single measurement in <b>the</b> far field <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> divergence, and then use these <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> BPP. The procedure above gives a more accurate result in practice, however.|$|R

5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E
50|$|The {{trousers}} {{were made}} {{out of the same}} Olive Drab (OD7) cotton sateen material and white cotton twill inner lining, and were equipped with both front and rear pockets. They also had buttoned tabs at <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> in order <b>to</b> cinch <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> For airborne troops, treated canvas cargo pockets were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trousers.|$|R

50|$|Kovave is a {{ceremony}} to initiate Papua New Guinea boys into adult society. It involves dressing up in a conical hat {{which has long}} strands of leaves hanging from <b>the</b> edge, down <b>to</b> below <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> <b>The</b> name Kovave is also used <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> head-dress.|$|R
5|$|When the two {{opposing}} forces reached {{the place of}} the ambush, Bardas ordered the trumpets blown and the two concealed Byzantine divisions attacked the Pechenegs from the flanks and the rear. Cut off from aid and surrounded, the Pechenegs began to panic and flee. One of their leaders tried to rally his men, but he was attacked by Bardas Skleros himself, who killed him with a single sword-blow that reportedly cut him in two from his head down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> through the Pecheneg's helmet and cuirass. The loss of the Pecheneg commander turned the battle into a complete rout, and panic spread to the Bulgarian contingent following behind the Pechenegs, which also suffered heavy casualties in the general chaos. The Byzantine casualties in the battle were low (Skylitzes speaks of 25 dead and Leo of 55) although they lost many horses to the Pecheneg arrows, while the losses of the Rus' force, although certainly lower than Leo's claimed 20,000, were still significant, probably running into several thousands.|$|E
25|$|A jerkin, usually cut low <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> {{in front}} {{to reveal the}} doublet beneath, with full skirts to the knee.|$|E
25|$|A {{camisole}} is {{a sleeveless}} undergarment for women, normally extending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{clothing}} <b>the</b> region referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> {{is considerably}} below <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> as defined anatomically. With {{the advent of}} pants and skirts {{that do not require}} support from above, <b>the</b> clothing <b>waist</b> moved down to a position where <b>the</b> body starts <b>to</b> expand <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> buttocks and a support is therefore available. The waistline of clothing is now generally well below <b>the</b> anatomical <b>waist.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> rules {{specific}} <b>to</b> each weapon must be followed. For example, it {{is prohibited}} <b>to</b> strike below <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> in mace warfare.|$|R
50|$|A waist cincher (sometimes {{referred}} to as a Waspie) is a belt worn around <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> wearer's <b>waist</b> physically smaller, or <b>to</b> create <b>the</b> illusion of being smaller.|$|R
25|$|Lower class men wore a {{one-piece}} garment {{called a}} cotte in English, tight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> with knee-length skirts and long sleeves over their hose.|$|E
25|$|As {{doublets}} became shorter, hose reached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> {{rather than}} the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the codpiece.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{each type}} of play is associated with particular costumes. The water sleeves of man (文) plays can be attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> or {{the sides of the}} breast areas. Costumes can be single or double breasted.|$|E
25|$|Drawing <b>the</b> Bow <b>to</b> Shoot <b>the</b> Eagle / Hawk / Vulture: While {{in a lower}} horse stance, the {{practitioner}} imitates the action of drawing a bow to either side. It is said <b>to</b> exercise <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> area, focusing on the kidneys and spleen.|$|R
25|$|Women's {{undergarments}} {{were essentially}} unchanged {{from the previous}} period; a knee-length chemise was worn beneath a boned corset and masses of starched petticoats. The corset could be laced tightly <b>to</b> narrow <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> {{but this was not}} the fashion necessity it became later in the century.|$|R
50|$|In France, England, and Flanders, {{the high}} {{waistline}} gradually descended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>waist</b> in front (following Spanish fashion) {{and then to}} a V-shaped point. Cuffs grew larger and were elaborately trimmed.|$|R
25|$|For men, corsets {{are more}} customarily used to slim the figure. However, {{there was a}} period from around 1820 to 1835 — ranging as late as the late 1840s in some {{instances}} — when a wasp-waisted figure (a small, nipped-in look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist)</b> was also desirable for men; wearing a corset sometimes achieved this.|$|E
25|$|Women’s parkas in the Yukon River {{area were}} longer than men's, with rounded hems and side splits that reached almost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> Farther {{south along the}} Kuskokwim River, parkas of both sexes {{extended}} to the ankles and were usually hoodless, requiring that a separate fur cap or hood be worn. Kuskokwim styles of parka decoration were far more elaborate.|$|E
25|$|In 848 Angoulême {{was sacked}} by the Viking chief Hastein. In 896 or 930 the city {{suffered}} another attack from invading Vikings {{but this time}} the Vikings faced an effective resistance. Guillaume I, third Count of Angoulême, at the head of his troops made them surrender in a decisive battle. During this engagement, he split open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> Stonius, the Norman chief, with a massive blow together with his helmet and breastplate.|$|E
50|$|It {{is awarded}} {{as a set}} of a nine rayed breast star, a collar with a lesser star, a yellow silk sash, worn from <b>the</b> right {{shoulder}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>waist</b> and a lesser star for the sash.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the mid-1820s, women's fashion {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full skirts of {{the prior}} century. In {{a repudiation of}} the Empire silhouette, <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> became <b>the</b> central focus of female dress. The corset assumed the dominant role it would hold {{for the rest of}} the 19th century. Designed <b>to</b> emphasize <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> it was pulled in as required <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> desired slenderness. Doctors and much of the press deplored the garment but were unable <b>to</b> override <b>the</b> dictates of fashion.|$|R
50|$|Indian {{members of}} the Indian Civil Service were {{entitled}} to civil uniform, with a turban or pagre replacing the cocked hat, or the national dress which they were accustomed to wear on ceremonial occasions. They could also wear a blue coat buttoning from <b>the</b> neck <b>to</b> below <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> worn with white trousers or pyjamas and the native head-dress.|$|R
25|$|Neave paid a rent of £300 to {{take the}} premises, a large sum in 1934, but it was {{justified}} {{by the success of}} the venture. The club registered 445 members within its first six weeks, and was visited by 2004 people. Admission was 1s for members, or 1s 6d on the door. According to the account of a policeman, the walls and ceilings were decorated with material featuring stars and dragons and the entertainment included a man stripped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> who passed burning papers over his upper body. Sexual contact between men was accepted.|$|E
25|$|The video {{features}} the two singers {{in the midst}} of an ocean. Farmer, dressed in a short black skirt, and Seal, stripped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> are on a wooden raft with a small sail and start to row. While Farmer stretches out on the raft, a storm begins to arrive : the wind picks up, the rain falls and lightning illuminates the sky. Seal, standing on the raft, is destabilized and falls into the water. Farmer tries to save him giving him her hand, but without success. The night starts to fall and Farmer, now alone on the raft, lights a match and puts off it immediately.|$|E
25|$|Dress {{coats and}} morning coats, the other main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of frock coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the frock coat {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal frock coat only buttons down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The frock coat that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only by clergymen.|$|E
