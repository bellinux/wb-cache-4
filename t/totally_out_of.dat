The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E

Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E

25|$|In the Second Intifada, the {{generally}} non-violent {{methods of the}} earlier uprising gave way to more brutal methods against both IDF troops and Israeli citizens: stone-throwing as the hallmark of resistance yielded place to martyrdom operations, overwhelmingly conducted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The intifada broke out with rock throwing to protest Ariel Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif on 28 September 2000, {{which led to a}} clash in which 6 Palestinians were killed, and 220 wounded by Israeli gunfire, while 70 Israeli police were injured by stoning. The incident rapidly escalated into the Second Intifada when, as rock-and Molotov-cocktail-throwing continued over the next two days, 24 Palestinians were shot dead, and an Israeli soldier was killed. At the outset, participating teenagers resumed the traditional stone-throwing to deny vehicles access to settlements. Israel's response was, according to Lev Luis Grinberg, to use all the weapons in its arsenal, including snipers, and shooting missiles from Apache helicopters at demonstrators and buildings. He concludes 'It responded with disproportionate force that only an army can unleash <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place against stone-throwing civilians. Human Rights Watch documented early that IDF soldiers were shooting stone throwing youths where no serious threats to their safety existed.|$|E

500|$|Cardistry is a {{portmanteau}} {{of cards}} and artistry. [...] The art form of card flourishing, {{commonly referred to}} as cardistry, grew out of simple flourishes used in close-up magic by magicians in the 1990s to early 2000s. Chris Kenner's notable two-handed Sybil cut from his 1992 publication <b>Totally</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> Control has carried great influence and gave birth to a series of advanced flourishes which today represents the foundation of the performance art. Sleight of hand pioneers Dan and Dave popularized cardistry on the world stage with their instructional DVD releases from 2004 and 2007.

500|$|The phrase [...] "hail to the thief" [...] {{was used}} by anti-George W.

500|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} {{as the second}} single from the parent album on May 6, 1998 in the United States. Curtiss {{was not aware of}} the fact that Madonna had recorded [...] "Sepheryn" [...] as [...] "Ray of Light" [...] and heard it for the first time being played on the radio. He [...] "couldn't believe it" [...] and was initially a bit annoyed, but became pleased with what Madonna had done with his original composition. He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15% were given to Maldoon's estate and the rest were earned by Madonna's record company. The singer said about the song: [...] "It's <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control. The original version is well over 10 minutes long. It was completely indulgent, but I loved it. It was heartbreaking to cut it down to a manageable length." [...] The original version was to be included on a compilation album, titled Veronica Electronica, although it was not released.

500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance.

Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive moaning and heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as {{a woman on the}} prowl, taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom.
