5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market {{were located in}} California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E

5|$|Culturally, the wall's {{symbolic}} {{role as a}} {{line between}} civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to weaken the Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming.

5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.

5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.|$|E
