5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to drive through Algonquin Park. However, one is required for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose and deer are very common through Algonquin, especially at night and in the morning, and present a major driving hazard.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects {{hard to see}} (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, {{where there is no}} background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E

5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling {{for the elimination of}} the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months {{and a lack of}} associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2014, Gray Television {{announced}} that it would shutter six stations and consolidate existing programming onto subchannels of Gray-owned stations in their respective market. Unlike Sinclair, however, Gray stated that it would sell the licenses of the shuttered stations to minority-owned broadcasters in collaboration with the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council – under the condition that they would operate them independently from other stations in the market, and without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> sharing agreements. All six of the stations were owned by companies other than Gray, but their non-license assets are either owned by Gray, or were operated by stations now owned by Gray under agreements. Gray would operate the affected stations under LMAs until the sales and consolidation are complete. Aside from one, most of the stations involved in these changes were related to Gray's acquisition of stations from Hoak Media. Three of these stations were immediately shut down the same day, while the remainder remained operated by Gray until the sales were completed. Gray announced buyers for the stations on August 27, 2014.|$|E

Routing is a significant issue and challenge in ad hoc networks and many routing protocols have been proposed like OLSR, AODV, DSDV,DSR, ZRP, and TORA, LAR so far to improve the routing performance and reliability. This research paper describes the characteristics of ad hoc routing protocols OLSR, AODV and ZRP based on the performance metrics like packet delivery ratio, end–to–end delay, throughput and jitter by increasing number of nodes in the network. This comparative study proves that OLSR, ZRP performs well in dense networks in terms of low mobility and low traffic but in high mobility and high traffic environment ZRP performs well than OLSR and AODV...|$|R
