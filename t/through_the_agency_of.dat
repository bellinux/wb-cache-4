5|$|Northern England in the 11th-century was {{a region}} quite {{distinct}} {{from the rest of}} the country. The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the Humber and Mersey estuaries, northward to the Firth of Forth, where, passing the western Kingdom of Strathclyde, it met the Kingdom of Alba (Scotland). Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s, by King Eadred, and subsequent control was exerted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> at least two ealdormen, one to the north and one to the south of the River Tees. The former is associated with the stronghold of Bamburgh, while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of York. It was a politically fragmented region. The western part, from Lancashire to Cumberland, was heavily settled by Norse-Gaels, while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo-Scandinavian regional magnates—thegns, holds and high-reeves—exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen. One such example was the magnate Thurbrand, a hold in Yorkshire, probably based in Holderness, whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the myths}} {{of the earlier}} Ophite system are but lightly touched on, there is some trace of an {{acquaintance}} with them, as for example the myth that Adam was brought forth by the Earth spontaneously; he lay without breath, without motion, without stirring, like a statue; being made after {{the image of the}} First Man, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> several Archons.

25|$|Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the {{subjective}} {{structures of the}} habitus can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains {{the continuity of the}} social order through time. As the individual habitus is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.|$|E

25|$|The Second Crusade (1147–1148) offered Roger an {{opportunity}} to revive attacks on the Byzantine Empire, the traditional Norman enemy to the East. It also afforded him {{an opportunity}}, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> Theodwin, a cardinal ever-vigilant for Crusade supporters, to strike up a correspondence with Conrad III of Germany {{in an effort to}} break his alliance with Manuel I Comnenus. Roger himself never went on an expedition against Byzantium, instead handing command to the skillful George. In 1147, George set sail from Otranto with seventy galleys to attack Corfu. According to Nicetas Choniates, the island capitulated thanks to George's bribes (and the tax burden of the imperial government), welcoming the Normans as their liberators. Leaving a garrison of 1,000 men, George sailed on to the Peloponnesus. He sacked Athens and quickly moved on to the Aegean Islands. He ravaged the coast all along Euboea and the Gulf of Corinth and penetrated as far as Thebes, Greece, where he pillaged the silk factories and carried off the Jewish damask, brocade, and silk weavers, taking them back to Palermo where they formed the basis for the Sicilian silk industry. George capped the expedition with a sack of Corinth, in which the relics of Saint Theodore were stolen, and then returned to Sicily. In 1149, however, Corfu was retaken. George went on a punitive expedition against Constantinople, but could not land and instead defied the Byzantine emperor by firing arrows against the palace windows. Despite this act, his expedition left no enduring effects.|$|E

500|$|For Simmel, culture {{referred}} to [...] "the cultivation of individuals <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> external forms {{which have been}} objectified {{in the course of}} history". While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern (rather than primitive or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, {{and other members of the}} Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between [...] "producers" [...] and [...] "consumers" [...] evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The [...] "cultural turn" [...] of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.|$|E

40|$|A {{close look}} at Yahwism and African concept of {{sacrifice}} and sacrificial rites will immediately reveal to an observer, some stunning similarities. These similarities re-echo the point that “the soul of religion is one”. The African generally express their worship to God <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divinities and other spiritual intermediaries. Yahwism however claim a direct worship of God. Both people subscribe copiously to sacrificial rite as means by which it is IJSER believed that the Supreme Being can be reached. The preponderance of sacrificial rites as a core in both religion foregrounds our attempt in this paper. As can be inferred, the work adopts evaluative and analytical methods and submits that sacrifice is a core in both religion and that striking similarities exist in both conceptions. The writers discover that these similarities are not well appreciated by adherents of Christian religion which is an offshoot of Yahwism, and command large subscription in Nigeria. This paper concludes with the note that if religions in Nigeria emphasize these commonalities in religious beliefs, this will engender peace and unity which forms the bedrock for ideal national development...|$|R
50|$|Conrad Veidt plays Dr. Warren (the Dr. Jekyll character) who changes into Mr. O'Connor (a {{parallel}} of Mr. Hyde). This {{transformation is}} brought about, not by experimentation with chemicals as in Stevenson's original, but <b>through</b> <b>the</b> supernatural <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> {{a bust of}} Janus (the Roman god of the doorway), which Warren / O'Connor purchases in the opening sequence {{as a gift for}} his sweetheart, Jane Lanyon (Margarete Schlegel).

500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night and Sleep in Act II, which is apt as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not what they seem. The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons tell us that the marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E

50|$|Before his death, Kuttimani {{was officially}} {{nominated}} to the Vaddukoddai constituency in October 15, 1982, when the then sitting member of TULF party, T.Thirunavukkarau died on August 1, 1982. However the legal sources, then {{under the control}} of President J. R. Jayewardene, ruled that Kuttimani's nomination as a member of parliament was invalid. The then Prisons Commissioner Priya Delgoda announced on October 16, 1982 that Kuttimani would not be released from prison to take his oaths at the parliament. Kuttimani's appointment was gazetted while he was under a sentence of death. In a statement issued to explain the reasons for nominating Kuttimani to the vacant parliamentary seat, the TULF officials included five. Among these are two prominent reasons: (1) Kuttimani's nomination is a token protest against the state terrorism perpetrated from time to time <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police and military personnel especially on the young Tamils of the country. (2) It is a protest against the death penalty imposed on Kuttimani and Jegan. Subsequently on February 4, 1983, Kuttimani's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment under the general amnesty proclaimed by President Jayewardene. After this, Kuttimani resigned his Vaddukoddai seat in the parliament, to which he was nominated.|$|R

We have developed a precision 1 D (spherical) multigroup implicit Boltzmann solver, SESAME 1 [1, 2], using the Feautrier technique, with the tangent-ray method to achieve excellent angular resolution. This code provides the spherical benchmark and testbed for our multi-D efforts (e. g., VULCAN/ 2 D, see below). In an effort to explore non-standard effects quickly and heuristically, Thompson, Quataert, and Burrows[3] (TQB) have modified SESAME to incorporate the centrifugal effects of differential rotation in an approximate way, {{as well as the}} heating and angular momentum redistribution effects of viscosity (perhaps due to the magneto-rotational instability, MRI). The neutrino-driven mechanism is already close to explosion and requires an increase in the energy deposition rate in the “gain region ” of only about 25 % to 40 %. TQB have shown that rapid rotation of the initial Chandrasekhar core can provide such a boost <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> centrifugal support and viscous heating alone.
