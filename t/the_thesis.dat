No {{copies of a}} Wittenberg printing of <b>the</b> Ninety-five <b>Theses</b> have survived, {{but this is not}} surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of <b>the</b> <b>Theses,</b> only mentioned <b>the</b> door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted <b>the</b> <b>Theses</b> on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post <b>the</b> <b>Theses</b> to <b>the</b> church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all.

Luther's ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for heresy, which culminated in his excommunication in 1521. Though <b>the</b> <b>Theses</b> were <b>the</b> start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to be as important as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will.
