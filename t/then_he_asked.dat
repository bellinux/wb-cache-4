500|$|The {{day after}} the game, Vézina was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens' dressing room on [...] to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with [...] "tears rolling down his cheeks. He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [...] had arranged in Georges' corner. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series." [...] Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where {{he died in the}} early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l'Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team.|$|E

500|$|During the sessions, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Finger Twist & Split," [...] "Lyrical Lies" [...] and [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)" [...] – all songs {{that had previously}} been released in demo form. Hacikyan said that the band initially wanted to [...] "pull away" [...] from the songs, but [...] "at the same time, we understand that most people haven’t heard them yet." [...] While preparing a mix, Squire would typically [...] "trigger" [...] the drums, a technique he uses to give the drums a thicker sound. However, the group was against the idea. Squire found it a [...] "fun challenge" [...] making the drums [...] "sound punchy without them." [...] Squire spent a few days doing a mixing draft of the album, with assistance from Paul Leavitt. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> for feedback from both the label and the group. After incorporating the feedback, he finalized the mixes, and sent the album for mastering. Ue Nastasi mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound.|$|E

Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July, the Pope deplored the [...] "increasingly tragic" [...] {{situation}} in the Middle East and how [...] "in the hearts of many, hatred and will of vengeance seem to grow".

The Pope exclaimed that those responsible should immediately cease hostilities, [...] "in the name of God". <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> governments and international institutions to make every effort to that end, and asked people of good will to continue sending relief aid and praying God for peace.|$|E

6000|$|And when he {{has done}} wrong, he thinks so still less; for <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> God all the more earnestly, not only to judge him, but to correct him likewise.

2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H.

2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly.
