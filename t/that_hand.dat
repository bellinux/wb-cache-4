5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for <b>that</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not {{cleanse the}} hands of organic material, but simply {{disinfect}} them.

25|$|Sandbag Cancellation: Some {{people play}} {{that there is}} a special card which cancels one bag on <b>that</b> <b>hand</b> for the side that takes it in their tricks. If the side which wins the special card makes no overtricks, or loses their bid, the special card has no effect. The special card may be either a fixed card or may be {{determined}} afresh by cutting a card before each deal.|$|E
25|$|After all tricks are taken, {{counters}} are tallied {{for each}} player. The three discards by {{the highest bidder}} count toward their counter score for the hand, so {{there is always a}} total of 250 points for the trick score among the three players. If the highest bidder fails to make their contract by adding meld points and trick points from the play, then their score is negative the amount of the bid for <b>that</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of <b>that</b> <b>hand</b> curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because {{from the point of view}} of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction.

25|$|Games {{with five}} hands or more {{typically}} modify partnership pinochle {{in a variety}} of ways. They are generally played with 1 1/2 or doubled decks, with extra dix added or withheld to make an even deal. With an odd number of players, the bidder asks for a desired card in the trump suit, with the first matching player being partner for <b>that</b> <b>hand.</b> Everyone else plays against the team. In larger groups, one or more players can sit out each hand allowing the remaining players to follow the appropriate rules for the respective number of players.|$|E

25|$|After Mrs. Marguerite Preston's {{arrival in}} Kenya in 1945 {{the next phase}} of the Bahá'í Faith in Kenya was part of the wide scale growth in the {{religion}} across Sub-Saharan Africa. There was an intensive series of plans and goals of pioneers across Sub-Saharan Africa. Particular plans to bring the religion to Uganda began in 1950 involving the cooperation of American, British, Egyptian, and Persian Bahá'í communities and reached a level of coordination and detail that materials were translated into languages widely used in Africa before most pioneers reached Africa. In 1950-1 the Bahá'ís in the United Kingdom pioneered to Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya. For example, in 1951 Ted Cardell left on 7 October as pioneer for Nairobi after the untimely death of Mrs. Preston's husband. In September 1951 youth Kimani Waiyaki is noted as visiting Green Acre Bahá'í School in the United States. Ted Cardell was perhaps the next pioneer to arrive in Kenya by April 1952. After receiving the news <b>that</b> <b>Hand</b> of the Cause Louis George Gregory had died previously on 31 July, a commemorative meeting for Gregory was held in Kampala at which Kenyan pioneers joined with those from Uganda) and twelve Africans. Mrs Preston and her eldest child were killed in a plane flight in early 1952 near Sicily. In December 1952 Persian pioneer 'Aziz Yazdi was able to settle in Nairobi and was joined by his wife and children by February 1953. Ursula Samandari, also {{a former member of the}} National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom, was elected to the nine-member Local Spiritual Assembly of Nairobi in 1953. By 1955 there were eight assemblies in Kenya.|$|E
500|$|Following Hughes's view, Duckles also {{believed}} the manuscript {{was written in}} two hands. In his view, the first hand wrote the titles for songs nos. 1-176 of the Cattalogue, and the second hand, probably that of Gamble himself, wrote of nos. 177-266 (leaving space left to accommodate future additions) {{as well as the}} alphabetical index. Duckles described the writing style of Hand 1 as favoring [...] "round, compact letter forms, vertical alignment, calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes," [...] when writing with a broad pen. Duckles admits <b>that</b> <b>Hand</b> 1 has [...] "two forms": [...] "When the hand writes with a finer quill, the letter forms are more loosely connected, the flourishes a little more pronounced, and there is a slight inclination to the right." [...] Hand no. 2 has a [...] "pronounced slant to the right, letter forms are thin and elongated and the pen is a fine one." [...] Duckles observed <b>that</b> <b>hand</b> no. 2 participated slightly in the preparation of part 1 (nos. 1-176) with only six songs, but all of the text incipits. Likes Hughes, Duckles also felt <b>that</b> <b>Hand</b> 2 is probably that of Gamble.|$|E

[...] Posner suggests that although Hand is remembered today as one of the three greatest judges in American history, his status as a truly [...] "great judge" [...] was not based on his [...] "slight" [...] contributions to First Amendment jurisprudence or other fields of constitutional law, but rather on his decisions in other areas such as antitrust, intellectual property, and tort law.|$|E

[...] However, a pitch from the Philadelphia Phillies' Ben Rivera broke the fourth metacarpal bone in Bagwell's left hand, ending his season prematurely.

The {{president}} gave age as the reason, but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas's autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt's belief <b>that</b> <b>Hand</b> was the best person for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand's behalf. [...] D.C. Circuit Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. [...] In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt’s new appointees, referring to Justice Hugo Black, Justice Douglas, and Justice Frank Murphy as [...] "Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul". [...] Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: [...] "It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on." ...|$|E

Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls <b>that</b> <b>Hand,</b> scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College.
