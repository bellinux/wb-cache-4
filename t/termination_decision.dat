40|$|This {{article is}} {{the winner of the}} Real Estate Finance {{manuscript}} prize (sponsored by Fannie Mae Foundation) presented at the 2001 American Real Estate Society Annual Meeting. Studies of mortgage <b>termination</b> <b>decisions</b> typically rely on a competing risks framework comparing defaults and prepayments. While useful tools have been developed to approximate the values of these competing default and prepayment options, the available metrics do not adequately account for the role of the conditional volatility of interest rates and housing prices in option valuation. Using a sample of 1, 428 mortgage loan payment histories, this study finds that exponential GARCH estimates of the conditional volatility of housing prices and interest rates influence mortgage <b>termination</b> <b>decisions</b> in a predictable manner. Specifically, increased housing price volatility is shown to enhance default option values, while increased interest rate volatility is shown to enhance prepayment option values. Therefore, it would appear that conditional volatility represents a more refined input into the competing risks option framework. ...|$|R

50|$|Space {{vehicles}} for sub-orbital and orbital flights from the Eastern and Western Test Ranges were destroyed if they endangered populated areas by crossing pre-determined destruct lines encompassing the safe flight launch corridor. To assist the RSO {{in making a}} flight <b>termination</b> <b>decision,</b> there are many indicators showing {{the condition of the}} space vehicle in flight. These included booster chamber pressures, vertical plane charts (later supplanted by computer-generated destruct lines), and height and speed indicators. Supporting the RSO for this information were a supporting team of RSOs reporting from profile and horizontal parallel wires used at lift-off (before radar could capture the vehicle) and telemetry indicators. After initial lift-off, flight information is captured with X and C-band radars, and S-Band telemetry receivers from vehicle-borne transmitters. At the Eastern Test Range, S and C-Band antennas were located in the Bahamas {{and as far as the}} island of Antigua, after which the space vehicle finished its propulsion stages or is in orbit. Two switches were used, ARM and DESTRUCT. The ARM switch shut down propulsion for liquid propelled vehicles, and the DESTRUCT ignited the primacord surrounding the fuel tanks. In the case of manned flight, the vehicle would be allowed to fly to apogee before the DESTRUCT was transmitted. This would allow the astronauts the maximum amount of time for their self-ejection.|$|E

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{study was designed}} to refine the search for reliable predictors of premature termination from adult psychotherapy by examining therapy-specific and contextual factors that may predict clients' decisions to leave treatment early. These variables included client's stage of change prior to treatment, client's level of self-determination or motivation for therapy, client and therapist expectations and any discrepancies between them, the therapeutic alliance, and practical barriers to treatment participation. To facilitate comparison with previous research, premature termination was operationalized in two manners, duration of treatment and type of <b>termination</b> <b>decision</b> (unilateral versus mutual agreement with the therapist), although type of <b>termination</b> <b>decision</b> was considered a better measure of premature termination. These variables were examined with self-report data from 107 client/therapist dyads at a community mental health clinic. Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively from both client and therapist perspectives before therapy began, after the third treatment session, and after therapy ended. Logistic regression analyses showed that barriers to treatment participation, measured at the end of therapy, and working alliance, measured after the third treatment session, predicted type of termination from the client perspective, and barriers predicted type of termination from the therapist's perspective. The therapist's perception of barriers to treatment added incremental predictive value to that of the client's. The client's perspective on barriers to treatment also enhanced the predictive value of the therapist's perception of barriers. The discrepancy between client and therapist expectations for therapy duration did not predict the nature of the <b>termination</b> <b>decision.</b> When a client had a low self-determination index score, or was non self-determined, but had expectations of longer therapy, he or she tended to make a unilateral decision to end therapy. If a client, who perceived a poor working alliance, was not far along in the stage of change process (e. g., more contemplative than active), s/he was more likely to make a unilateral decision to end therapy. The strengths and limitations of the study and implication of these results for future research and clinical application are discussed. The findings support the overall contention of this study that it is therapy-specific and contextual factors, and not client or therapist factors alone, that predict the likelihood of premature termination...|$|E

40|$|The soft budget {{constraint}} refers to the phenomenon that a firm expects {{to survive in the}} future when it is financially insolvent. This is widely {{recognized as one of the}} important reasons for the inefficiency and, eventually, the collapse of contemporary socialist economies. The purpose of this paper is to explore the cause of the soft {{budget constraint}} in a formal way. Using a comparative setting which includes botht he socialist system and the market system, I show that public ownership of capital is a sufficient condition for the {{soft budget constraint}}. the intuition is that under public ownership of capital, the firm (which consists of labor and management) retains its control right regarding the disposition of the capital. thus, the ex post <b>termination</b> <b>decision</b> of the firm's investment project is socially efficient, which means that so long as the financial loss is not as big as the potential loss of human capital due to the termination of the firm, the firm should survive. This gives rise to the soft budget constraint. Similarly, the "hard" budget constraint occurs under private ownership, where the firm can be excluded from the <b>termination</b> <b>decision.</b> Next, I show that ex ante, the soft budget constraint is inefficint while the "hard" budget constraint can be efficient, since given limited liability, the only way to discourage the firm from proposing bad projects is by threatening to incur losses to the human capital when the project indeed is bad. Furthermore, it is shown that public ownership of capital causes excessive (relative to the socially optimal level) demand for investment in socialist economies, while private ownership of capital results in under-investment in market economies. Such phenomena have been widely recognized in comparative economics...|$|E

The reason is that we did not rank the identified reasons in relation to one another, but rated them individually. However, Kendall’s W only measures absolute consensus for rankings. Looking at changes in consensus is reasonable when striving for consensus in terms of stable rating distributions at the end of a Delphi study, i.e., minor changes in the rating results of two subsequent rounds (von der Gracht 2012). In round four, Kendall’s W was 0.08 and 0.06 for routine and nonroutine processes.|$|E

Is this “prevalence effect” {{a result of}} the observers' {{expectation}} of target prevalence or of repetition priming from repeated “no” responses? If number of repetitions determines “no” RTs, independent of target prevalence, evidence would favor a repetition priming account.

In experiment 1, we conducted visual search tasks where prevalence varied across blocks, and analyzed correct rejection trials in time series. The main effect of number of repetitions was not statistically significant, but the main effect of target prevalence was statistically significant. In experiment 2, high-prevalence and low-prevalence trials were randomly mixed and the prevalence for the next trial was cued.
