Other two pretreatment of Alkali and Ultrasonic following MAD process were investigated in this paper to compare with effect of TAD-MAD process on sludge stabilization and biogas production. The results showed that VSS removal rates for three processes of TAD-MAD, Alkali-MAD and Ultrasonication-MAD could achieve 40 % at 10 d or 11 d, which can meet the requirements of the GB 18918 - 2002 guidelines. soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in the supernatant could increase to the highest values at initial 4 d for three different processes, and subsequently decline during the latter part of digestion. For TAD-MAD process, SCOD and VFA could rapidly reach to the highest values 16000 mg/L and 7222 mg/L at initial 2 d respectively, which achieved more significant effect on cell lysis. All three pretreatments improved biogas production, but TAD-MAD process could produce the most amounts of CH 4 (481 mL CH 4 g− 1 VSS) and cumulative biogas production of 12496 mL at end of digestion. pH between 7. 04 and 7. 92 in three systems could maintain in neutral and subalkaline values.

40|$|According to the National Waste Management Plan 2014 (NWMP 2014) {{recommended}} {{method of}} utilization {{of sewage sludge}} is using it for agricultural purposes or for land reclamation. The sludge {{is characterized by a}} high content of organic substances, microelements and biogenic compounds, through which sewage sludge possess high soil formation and fertilization properties. It is assumed that in 2020 approximately 30 % of the sludge production will be used for agricultural purposes, while 15 % will be used for land reclamation. We have to remember that prior to the introduction of sludge into the ground, security, health and chemical requirements should be met. In order to use the sludge for agricultural purposes, the process of their disposal should be previously carried out e. g. Autoheated <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Digestion</b> (ATAD). It allows for hygienisation of sewage sludge and reducing the heavy metal content. As a result, processed sewage sludge is characterized by the presence of heavy metals in amounts which do not exceed the standards. It is also deprived of microorganisms. The stabilized sludge is characterized by high phosphorus and calcium content. Therefore there is possibility to use the examined sludge in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} studied to further treat anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) at sewage treatment plants. However, the process, {{which is called}} post <b>aerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> (PAD), only achieves limited degradation of the ADS. Here, we present a new study using ultrasonic pretreatment to enhance full-scale ADS degradation during PAD. The experiments examined the <b>aerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> of ultrasonically pretreated ADS and untreated ADS using activated sludge as digesting sludge. The ADS was degraded by 28 %, 35 % and 44 % within the 5 day PAD period, when pretreated ultrasonically (20 kHz, 10 min) at 25 W, 50 W and 100 W, respectively. In contrast, {{in the absence of}} prior sonication, the ADS was only degraded by 24 % in the same PAD period. Increased inorganic nitrogen generation and increased percentage of dead cells occurred in the ultrasonically pretreated ADS, indicating that endogenous respiration resulted in the reduction of volatile solids. The ultrasonic pretreatment significantly improved the <b>aerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> efficiency, which resulted in higher ADS degradation. Additionally, we show that the ultrasonic pretreatment could be an economically favorable technology when the cost of sludge transport and disposal is above $ 55 per wet tonne...|$|R

The level of Salmonella spp. was also reduced during aerobic treatment of sludge. In general, aerobic treatment of sludge reduced, but did not eliminate, indicator bacteria and Salmonella spp...|$|R
