Four controlled, manned, and electronically scored surface attack ranges are available for pilots to practice basic air-to-surface weapons delivery, including bombing, rocket delivery, and strafing. Additionally, three expansive, uncontrolled <b>tactical</b> <b>ranges</b> are available. Each of these <b>tactical</b> <b>ranges</b> spans several hundred square miles, and each contains two full-size airfield mockups plus many diverse arrays of targets, including structures, vehicle convoys, aircraft, and armor. These ranges are used to train pilots for strike and close air support missions, and support various types of live ordnance. Furthermore, JTACs from various military services and countries frequently train on the same ranges and direct the air attacks. An air-to-air gunnery range is also available.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} statistical tracking error measures and asset allocation restrictions expressed as admissible weight ranges. Typically, tracking errors are calculated as annual standard deviations of return differentials between tracking portfolio and benchmark. In practice, however, constraints on tactical deviations from benchmark weights are often imposed instead on the portfolio manager to ensure adequate tracking. Simulating various investment strategies subject to such constraints, we illustrate how the size of acceptable deviations from the benchmark relates to the statistical tracking error. Using an example based on actual market data, we find that imposing fairly large <b>tactical</b> asset allocation <b>ranges</b> implies surprisingly small tracking errors. Another finding of the paper is that tactical asset allocation restrictions should not only restrict the <b>tactical</b> <b>ranges</b> of the individual asset classes, but even more importantly, the tracking of the individual asset classes...|$|R

40|$|The army is {{interested}} in using acoustic sensors in the battlefield to perform vehicle identijication usingpassive microphone and seismic arrays. The main advantages of acoustic arrays are that they are non-line of sight, low cost, low power, can be made small and rugged and can provide 360 ° coverage. Their capability includes target detection, bearing, tracking, class~fication and identification, and can provide wake-up and cueing for other sensors. Acoustic arrays can be deployed in an expandable tracking system: the outputs of a nework of acoustic arrays can detect, track, and idenrib ground targets at <b>tactical</b> <b>range</b> by triangulating the reports from several distributed arrays.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this test is to compare the visual {{detection}} of military targets in the TARDEC Visual Perception laboratory (VPL) with detection performance in the field. Thirty 35 mm color slides were used from a Marine Corps field test to validate the test procedures used in the TARDEC Visual Perception Laboratory (VPL). The color slides were of seven military vehicles positioned at <b>tactical</b> <b>range</b> in the desert. The correlation of the laboratory to the field ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 95 depending on the variables analyzed and questions asked of the subjects. The highest correlation, 0. 95, was obtained when comparing identification rates of the vehicles between {{the field and the}} lab. VPL PROCEDURAL SETUP The test subjects were positioned in front of a rear-projection screen. The distance from the screen to the subject was 259 cm. The AAV (Assault Amphibian Vehicle) in image 4 - 1 was used to check the distance from the projector to the screen. The actual length of the AAV is 7. 943 m and at a distance of 1 km, the vehicle subtense 0. 0078 radians. With the subject to the screen distance of 259 cm, the AAV size was 2 cm high on the screen.

40|$|Abstract-This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the performance of binary frequency-shift keyed (BFSK) communication over frequency-selective fading channels in the <b>tactical</b> VHF <b>range.</b> Channel parameters were extracted from time-series measurements of channel impulse response data. These data were recorded during channel measurements in several mountainous areas in the Austrian Alps with a wideband channel sounder, developed in our Laboratory. Based on these parameters expressions of the bit error rate (BER) are derived. Calculations using the demonstrated method show that for typical data rates (2 kbit/s- 20 kbit/s) an error floor between 10 - 4 and 10 - 1 is predicted. An error free uncoded communication in the <b>tactical</b> VHF <b>range</b> is impossible in these environments. analytical results and finally section VI offers some conclusions. II. CHANNEL MEASUREMENTS AND MODELING Analyses and results reported in this paper are based on wideband channel measurements made at the center frequency of 60 MHz. These time-series measurements of impulse response data were made with an real-time channel sounder, based on a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) pulse compression technique. I...|$|R
