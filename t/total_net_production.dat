50|$|In a {{gasoline}} engine, this inert exhaust displaces {{the amount of}} combustible matter in the cylinder. In a diesel engine, the exhaust gas replaces some of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture. Because NOx forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR reduces the amount of NOx the combustion generates (though at some loss of engine efficiency). Gases re-introduced from EGR systems will also contain near equilibrium concentrations of NOx and CO; the small fraction initially within the combustion chamber inhibits the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production</b> {{of these and other}} pollutants when sampled on a time average. Most modern engines now require exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. Chemical properties of different fuels limit how much EGR may be used.

5000|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum yield}} of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation is 38 (assuming 3 molar equivalents of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per FADH2). In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH are generated in glycolysis, {{which takes place}} in the cytoplasm. Transport of these two equivalents into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the ATP synthase/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP yield from NADH and FADH2 to less than the theoretical maximum yield. [...] The observed yields are, therefore, closer to ~2.5 ATP per NADH and ~1.5 ATP per FADH2, further reducing the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production</b> of ATP to approximately 30.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of horizontal grid resolution in a physical model on an embedded primary production model. The area for the experiment was along the west coast of Norway, from 60 ◦N to 70 ◦N, an area of high mesoscale activity. The HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model was coupled with the NORWegian ECOlogical Model system, and run in a nested system, consisting of three model grids with horizontal resolution of 50 km, 16 km and 4. 5 km (hereafter: COARSE, MEDIUM and FINE) in the focus area. Two main results were obtained, first, the composition of the phytoplankton functional groups changed with increasing model grid resolution. In FINE, the diatoms produced a larger part (60 %) of the total annual primary production than the flagellates, whereas in COARSE and MEDIUM, the primary production from the two phytoplankton groups were equal. This was explained by a higher transport of silicate into the euphotic layer in FINE compared to the other two. Second, the differences in the primary production first became large when the resolution of the model grid reached the Rossby radius of deformation. Whereas the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> in MEDIUM only was 5 % larger than in COARSE, the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> in FINE was 20 % higher than in COARSE.

The main energy source used in the Greek electricity generation sector is lignite as there are large reserves in the country. Petroleum is also used at a great extent mainly in the islands in the autonomous power generation systems, while the use of natural gas is also increasing. Although lignite is a “cheap” energy source, the environmental impacts associated with its use are high, something that applies also for petroleum and in a lower extent with natural gas.

40|$|Abstract. Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbioses {{with most}} {{temperate}} and boreal tree species, but difficulties in measuring carbon allocation to these symbionts {{have prevented the}} assessment of their importance in forest ecosystems.

Because total belowground allocation can be estimated using carbon balance techniques, these relationships should allow ecologists to incorporate mycorrhizal fungi into existing ecosystem models. In field studies, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 % to 22 % of total allocation, but wide differences in measurement techniques made intercomparisons difficult.

40|$|Introduction Liquid fuels will be {{the fuel}} of choice for air and cargo {{transport}} for the coming decades. Synthetic fuels produced by the power-to-liquid route are a promising alternative to 1. generation biofuels. Sustainable hydrogen can be derived via water electrolysis using renewable power. Sustainable carbon sources are biomass or carbon dioxide taken from air. “Unavoidable” CO 2 from industrial processes like steel or cement production might be considered as reused CO 2 reducing the societies footprint. The combination of renewable syngas production and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is investigated and the efficiency, costs and realistic quantities of synthetic fuels production is compared for different process routes and feedstocks. However, whether the new fuels will prevail on the market depends {{on a variety of}} factors, e. g. <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production</b> costs and availability of feedstocks. Methods Currently, the Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) are intensely discussed.

Furthermore, a combined process concept called Power-Biomass-to-Liquid (PB-t-L) is developed and presented. Special emphasis is given to heat and material integration of each process route. Results Renewable synthetic fuels can be produced at a cost of 1. 50 to 4. 50 €/l, depending on the feedstock, process route, equipment cost and scale of plant. Hydrogen generation is the most significant cost factor, drawing the attention towards the renewable power generation cost as well as the electrolyzer type, efficiency and investment cost.

40|$|The {{link between}} water use and {{electricity}} generation {{is very strong}} and largely omitted from the public policies aimed at sustainable generation of electricity. Electricity is required for treating and pumping water to its destination, and water is required for electricity generation at thermoelectric power plants for cooling purposes, and for the operation of environmental control devices that reduce air emissions. North Carolina is ranked 9 th in the United States for electricity <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production,</b> according to the Energy Information Administration. Thermoelectric power freshwater withdrawals far outstrip all other water withdrawal categories; by the year 2000, thermoelectric power freshwater withdrawals were approaching 8, 000 million gallons per day, and as the population continues to grow in North Carolina, that number can only be expected to increase. They make {{some of the largest}} water withdrawals in the state of North Carolina, but they only consume approximately 3 % of the water they intake. The consumptive use percentage of 3 % is misleading because it doesn’t take into account forced evaporation. As mentioned previously, power plants require intake water to use for cooling purposes in the electricity generation process. The withdrawn cooling waters, once run through the plant, are returned to rivers/lakes at a higher temperature than the ambient water temperature. This higher temperature water causes additional evaporation (forced evaporation) from the river/lake. Forced evaporation should be of particular concern to North Carolina due to the severe droughts that have occurred in the region in recent history which threaten energy production as well as other water uses (ex. drinking water supply). In this project we find that forced evaporation represents an average 22 % increase in power plant water consumption in North Carolina, when compared to water consumption occurring during electricity generation on-site. We also look at the impact that air emission controls have on the plants water consumption. If carbon emissions are required to be controlled in the future, then water use at all power plants will increase, on average, approximately 5 %. The water lost to forced evaporation and emissions controls will add additional strain to power plants located in drought prone regions...|$|E

40|$|Processes like lateral {{river bed}} {{migration}} (meandering) {{and changes in}} width and depth of its bed are {{an essential part of}} the sediment dynamics of a river system. For a given time period, these processes can either be a net sediment source or sink within the catchments sediment budget. They also have a large influence on the preservation potential of floodplain deposits, and thus also on the value of river valleys as an environmental archive. This study concerns the importance of river channel processes within the Dijle catchment (780 km 2), situated in the Belgian loess belt. Rivers of this catchment have a meandering pattern within very wide (up to 1. 9 km) floodplains. The position of the riverbanks for a 1. 4 km long stretch was measured in 2008 using an RTK-GPS, and it was compared with mapped river banks of 1969. For the same stretch, 20 topographic transects across the river channel were measured in 2008, and compared with transects from 1969 at the same locations. Average changes were calculated for three parts of the stretch to avoid influences by the migration of pools and bars on individual transects. The total amount of sediment eroded and deposited during the study period can be derived from the combination of depth and width changes calculated for the transects and the mapping of river bank changes. Specific budgets related with meandering and bed dimension changes can also be calculated. Results show that during this 40 year period, the river bed has on average incised and widened, while some river meanders are subject to active meandering. Total erosion amounts 0. 31 m 3 a 1 per m river length whereas total deposition equals 0. 13 m 3 a 1 per m river length, resulting in net erosion of 0. 18 m 3 a 1 per m river length. During the study period, point bar deposition could not compensate for the erosion due to meandering, resulting in new and lower floodplain level being formed by those point bar deposits. As a result, river meandering is also a net source of sediment, yielding 0. 12 m 3 a 1 per m river length (= 70 % of <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production),</b> while changes in river channel dimension yield a net erosion of 0. 06 m 3 a 1 per m river length. Changes in river dimensions can be explained by increasing urbanization of the catchment over the time period considered. If these values would be extrapolated for the entire, 36 km-long, main river, net sediment export out of the catchment due to within-channel processes would amount to 9 103 Mg a 1, or 15 - 20 % of current-day suspended sediment load. status: publishe...|$|E

Des liens significatifs entre les différents constituants de la chaîne trophique ont été identifiés, et les facteurs clés de la production piscicole mis en évidence. En début de saison, une régulation ascendante oriente la composition et l'abondance de la flore algale, suivant les concentrations de N et PO 4 et leurs proportions relatives. L'abondance du zooplancton filtreur est liée à la fois aux ressources trophiques disponibles (cellules algales aisément ingérables) et à la pression de prédation qu'il subit de la part des juvéniles de poissons. La production piscicole de gardon (Rutilus rutilus) et de tanche (Tinca tinca) est plus faible si ces espèces sont associées (compétition alimentaire interspécifique chez les juvéniles) ou produites en présence d'un carnivore. En contre-partie d'une production piscicole plus faible, la stabilité de la structure du réseau trophique est accrue. Les concentrations en P-PO 4, la quantité de grands Crustacés planctoniques et une densité de poissons adaptée aux capacités du milieu constituent les facteurs clés de la production piscicole finale. The main parameters (physicochemistry, plankton, fish) of {{two sets}} of fish ponds (8 and 9 ponds respectively; area between 0. 2 and 1. 2 ha; mean depth: 1. 5 m) located in south-west of France were monitored during two consecutive seasons (1995, 1996). The benthic macroinvertebrates and the microbial loop were not taken into account for these field studies. No macrophytes were growing into the studied ponds. The multivariate analyses of the two yearly data bases provided informations {{on the strength of}} the various links among and between the successive compartments of the food web (physicochemistry of water, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish) and identified the bottlenecks of the food web to the fish production. Integrated water samples were collected bimonthly (from May to September) for field measurements (T°, pH, dissolved O 2, Secchi disc transparency, conductivity) and laboratory analyses ([N. NH 4], [N. NO 2], [N. NO 3], [ortho-P], [Ca] using a HACH spectrophotometer). The groups of planktonic algae (Diatoms, Desmidieae, Dinophyceae, Chlorococcales and Volvocales, Euglenophyceae, Cyanobacteriae) were identified and classified in three categories (dominant, present, rare). Rotifers, Cladocerans and Copepods were numbered (N/litre) into two size classes (large or small, with a threshold at 400 µm). One hundred liters of pond water were filtered through a plankton net (mesh size: 80 µm) and the volume of sedimented zooplankters measured as zooplankton biovolume (mL/ 100 liters). The total numbers of fish stocked and collected are noted (weight and number of fish/species; age classes). Working on private production ponds, we were not allowed to make catches for stomach contents studies. The data from each season were analysed through PCA, MCA, crosstabs (STATBOX software from GRIMMER); for each species of fish a ratio was computed between the biomass of the collected juveniles and the biomass of the stocked breeders. In the studied fish ponds like in other eutrophic bodies of water, the densities of the planktonic organisms follow a bimodal evolution, with high numbers at the end of spring (June) and the end of summer (August), separated by a phase of more transparent water. During the first phase, Daphnia and large Cladocerans are predominant with Chlorophyceae, replaced later in the season by species of smaller size and shorter life cycle (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Cyclops), associated with Cyanobacteriae, at a time where predation by fish is more intense as their biomass increase. In spring, different algal communities develop with density depending on the initial concentrations of inorganic N and PO 4 and the PO 4 /N ratio. If the available dissolved N and P are infra-optimal, mixotroph algae (Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae) and Rotifers predominate. When [N] is not limiting (N/P between 4 / 1 and 10 / 1), Chlorophyceae become predominant, but if PO 4 is in relative excess, they are replaced by Cyanobacteria. The abundance of grazing Cladocerans is linked to the capacity of the available algal cells to be ingested. Cyanobacteria can already become predominant in May because of the selective grazing by Cladocerans on more readily ingestible phytoplankton taxa. Links among groups of zooplankton are evidenced: small grazers (Rotifers, Cladocera 2 mL/ 100 L), a water transparency between 0. 30 and 0. 70 m and are related to a shift from small size species (400 µm). In spring numerous small zooplankters facilitate the survival of the fish fry, whose growth is later ensured by high densities of larger Crustaceans. From the fish production data, the ratios between the biomass of collected juveniles and the biomass of stocked breeders were compared under different rearing conditions for the various species. Roach Rutilus rutilus, tench Tinca tinca and gudgeon Gobio gobio have similar production potentials when reared separately (juveniles production in kg is 5 to 7 times the biomass of the breeders). When roach and tench are reared together under the same conditions, the ratio is divided by 2 for each species, but the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>production</b> of fish remains at the same level (500 - 600 kg/ha). This shows that there is a strong feeding competition on zooplankton between the juveniles of roach and tench. In opposition, there is little feeding competition between roach and gudgeon. When the two benthic species are associated, tench strongly dominates the gudgeon. The addition of a carnivorous species to the association of roach + tench reduces the final total production by 250 - 300 kg/ha. Between 30 and 40 kg of carnivorous fish (Esox lucius or Stizostedion lucioperca) are produced {{at the expense of the}} equivalent of a final biomass of 200 kg/ha of young Cyprinids. The pressure of predation from these two top consumers is 2 to 3 times less intense compared to the predation exerted by the large-mouth bass Micropterus salmoides. As the basic food for juvenile fish, the zooplankton can be considered here as the key element of the food web, between the bottom-up (production) and top-down (predation) effects. The ortho-phosphate concentration is the limiting factor for the ascending regulation of the food web, and the amount of initially stocked fish regulates the top-down effects. The maximum net final fish production reached about 800 kg/ha with roach alone, or in association with tench. In such cases, Cyanobacteria were dominant in the pond with the presence of Chlorophyceae. The low density of zooplankton and the sub-optimal dissolved oxygen concentrations during the day seem to indicate that at such production level, the food chain is near to collapse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Vegetation {{is a basic}} {{component}} of urban-suburban environments with significant area coverage. As a major vegetation type in US cities, urban turfgrass provides a range of important ecological services. This study examined the biological carbon fixation of turfgrass in a typical residential neighborhood by linking ground-based measurements, high resolution satellite remote sensing, and ecological modeling. The spatial distribution of turfgrass and its vegetative conditions were mapped with QuickBird satellite imagery. The significant amount of shadows existing in the imagery were detected and removed {{by taking advantage of}} the high radiometric resolution of the data. A remote sensing-driven production efficiency model was developed and parameterized with field biophysical measurements to estimate annual <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> of turfgrass. The results indicated that turfgrass accounted for 38 % of land cover in the study area. Turfgrass assimilated 0 – 1, 301 g·C·m− 2 ·yr− 1 depending on vegetative conditions and management intensity. The average annual <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> per unit turfgrass cover by golf course grass (1, 100. 5 g·C·m− 2) was much higher than that by regular lawn grass (771. 2 g·C·m− 2). However, lawn grass contributed more to the <b>total</b> <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> than golf course grass due to its larger area coverage, although with higher spatial variability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of aboveground soft tissue repre-sents an important share of <b>total</b> <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> in tropical rain forests. Here {{we draw from}} {{a large number of}} published and unpublished datasets (n = 81 sites) to assess the determinants of litterfall variation across South Ameri-can tropical forests. We show that across old-growth trop-ical rainforests, litterfall averages 8. 61 ± 1. 91 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 (mean ± standard deviation, in dry mass units). Secondary forests have a lower annual litterfall than old-growth trop-ical forests with a mean of 8. 01 ± 3. 41 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1. An-nual litterfall shows no significant variation with total annual rainfall, either globally or within forest types. It does not vary consistently with soil type, except in the poorest soils (white sand soils), where litterfall is significantly lower than in other soil types (5. 42 ± 1. 91 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1). We also stud...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} was planned {{to observe the}} growth response of carps towards rice polish and maize gluten supplementation in ammonium nitrate fertilized ponds. Two earthen ponds were selected and each pond was stocked with 15 Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), 25 Rohu (Labeo rohita) and 15 Mori (Cirrhinus mrigala) with a total number of 55 fishes. Pond 1 was treated with ammonium nitrate and rice polish while pond 2 was treated with ammonium nitrate and maize gluten. <b>Total</b> <b>net</b> fish <b>production</b> of pond 1 and pond 2 was remained 1104. 3 and 1374. 2 kg/ha/year, respectively. Gross fish production/ha/year of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala was 1163. 9 kg and 1424. 0 kg in pond 1 and pond 2. The physico-chemical parameters were measured on weekly basis. Temperature, pH, light penetration and planktonic biomass showed non-significant relationship.

40|$|Why do some forests produce biomass more {{efficiently}} than others? Variations in Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE: <b>total</b> <b>Net</b> Primary <b>Production</b> (NPP) / Gross Primary Production (GPP)) {{may be due to}} changes in wood residence time (Biomass/NPPwood), temperature, or soil nutrient status. We tested these hypotheses in 14, one ha plots across Amazonian and Andean forests where we measured most key components of <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> (NPP: wood, fine roots, and leaves) and autotrophic respiration (Ra; wood, rhizosphere, and leaf respiration). We found that lower fertility sites were less efficient at producing biomass and had higher rhizosphere respiration, indicating increased carbon allocation to belowground components. We then compared wood respiration to wood growth and rhizosphere respiration to fine root growth and found that forests with residence times 40 yrs. A comparison of rhizosphere respiration to fine root growth showed that rhizosphere growth respiration was significantly greater at low fertility sites. Overall, we found that Amazonian forests produce biomass less efficiently in stands with residence times > 40 yrs and in stands with lower fertility, but changes to long-term mean annual temperatures do not impact CUE...|$|R
