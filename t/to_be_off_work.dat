50|$|Under the Liberal {{government}} of the 1910s, the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George introduced a scheme whereby National Insurance contributions (by employer) became compulsory for all workers {{between the ages of}} 16 and 70. This was enacted via the National Insurance Act, and caused outrage among the farmers local to Turriff, who claimed that their contributions were too high; and that, as they were rarely able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> due to illness like industrial workers, it was unfair for them to have to pay for a service they were unlikely to use.|$|E
5000|$|... "Accident" [...] {{includes}} {{assaults on}} employees and suicides on transport systems (reg.2). The report {{must be made}} by the [...] "quickest practicable means" [...] and confirmed by a written report within ten days (reg.3(2)). When an accident at work results in a reportable injury that, within a year of the accident, causes the death of the employee, the death itself must be reported, even if the accident and injury have already been reported (reg.4).On occasions, an injury may caused a member of staff <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> for more than seven working days, or prevent them from completing their normal work duties. If this situation arises then the company must notify the enforcing authority of the incident. When calculating the seven consecutive days, the day of the accident is not counted but the period after is, including weekends. For example, if an employee normally works Monday to Friday, is injured on a Tuesday and does not return to work until the following Thursday, then the incident will be required to be reported. This is because he/she will have been off work for eight days i.e. Wednesday to Wednesday inclusive.|$|E
40|$|Background: In New Zealand (NZ), 20 % {{of adults}} report a disability, of which one-third {{is caused by}} injury. No {{prospective}} epidemiological studies of predictors of disability following all-cause injury among New Zealanders have been undertaken. Internationally, {{studies have focused on}} a limited range of predictors or specific injuries. Although these studies provide useful insights, applicability to NZ is limited given the importance of NZ’s unique macro-social factors, such as NZ’s no-fault accident compensation and rehabilitation scheme, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Objectives: (1) To quantitatively determine the injury, rehabilitation, personal, social and economic factors leading to disability outcomes following injury in NZ. (2) To qualitatively explore experiences and perceptions of injury-related outcomes in face-to-face interviews with 15 Māori and 15 other New Zealanders, 6 and 12 months after injury. Setting: Four geographical regions within NZ. Design: Prospective cohort study with telephone inter-views 1, 4 and 12 months after injury. Participants: 2500 people (including 460 Māori), aged 18 – 64 years, randomly selected from ACC’s entitlement claims register (people likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> for at least 1 week or equivalent). Data: Telephone interviews, electronic hospital and ACC injury data. Exposures include demographic, social, economic, work-related, health status, participation and/ or environmental factors...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{prevalence}} {{and cost of}} low back pain, particularly among workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation patients, it is advantageous to understand how various psychological constructs {{may be related to}} prolonged disability and failure to return to work. Malingering is a psychological construct that is clearly relevant for worker compensation populations and is a construct that is well suited for experimental control within an analog study. Malingering is the intentional exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms that are motivated by external incentives such as time away from work. The ability to detect malingering in such a population with psychological assessments is unclear. An analog study was conducted in which we instructed college students to portray themselves as injured workers who received a back injury that required them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> while they recovered. Students were then told that they would be seeing a psychologist who would attempt to ascertain their abilities to return to work via the MMPI- 2. Students were then randomly instructed to respond to the MMPI- 2 in three different ways: a control condition was instructed to respond as if they suffered a workplace back injury that resulted in significant pain; a subtle fake-bad condition who received the control instruction plus were informed they did not enjoy their work and their back injury allowed them to enjoy personal and family time more; and a fake-bad condition that received the control instruction plus were asked to deliberately portray themselves as experiencing physical symptoms severe enough to keep them off work longer. Currently, no assessment of malingering exists within a compensated low back pain population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the MMPI- 2 can be used to differentially identify 2 ̆ 2 patients 2 ̆ 2 who are instructed to report symptoms veridically versus 2 ̆ 2 patients 2 ̆ 2 instructed to consciously feign and magnify symptoms in an effort to avoid returning to work. Malingering and non-malingering patients 2 ̆ 7 scores on the MMPI- 2 validity and clinical scales were subjected to a cluster analysis to determine if a malingering profile could be accurately identified. A 5 -cluster validity solution and 4 -cluster clinical (both with K correction) solution were accepted. Substantially lower scores on L and K, elevated scores on F on the 5 -cluster validity solutions, distinguished the 2 ̆ 2 malingering 2 ̆ 2 profile. The 4 -cluster clinical solution was characterized by elevated scores on the clinical scales of hypochondriasis, depression, paranoia, and schizophrenia, which distinguished the 2 ̆ 2 malingering 2 ̆ 2 profile. The results indicate that the MMPI- 2 could be useful in detecting malingering in compensated back pain patients. Results are discussed in the context of pain studies...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{freedom of}} {{religion}} is well established as a fundamental right internationally and within Europe, {{the extent to which}} it should be enjoyed in the workplace is still the subject of some debate. There are two main areas of contention: one involves religious workers in secular organisations and the extent to which religious individuals can expect an organisation to accommodate their religious needs; the other concerns the interests of religious organisations and the extent to which they should be governed by equality laws. Questions which arise include: can religious employees expect <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed time <b>off</b> <b>work</b> for prayer or other religious observance; and can religious organisations require that staff hold particular religious beliefs in order to work for the organisation? A particular area of concern <b>is</b> how <b>to</b> deal with the tension that can arise between equality grounds, such as where religious equality and sexual orientation equality seem mutually irreconcilable. Although legal protection for religion at work can be seen in many states, the UK example <b>is</b> used below, <b>to</b> illustrate the areas of tension which arise surrounding religion and belief at work...|$|R
