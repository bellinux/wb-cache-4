5|$|The Bristol County Jail {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. <b>The</b> <b>jail</b> is {{significant}} as a relatively unaltered historic jail that was important to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is also significant in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> and runs a small museum shop from the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his arrest for mail obstruction, Debs was not yet a socialist.

50|$|<b>The</b> Don <b>Jail</b> is <b>the</b> only <b>jail</b> to {{have been}} officially {{designated}} <b>the</b> Toronto <b>Jail,</b> yet has rarely {{been referred to as}} such outside official circles, with the facility more commonly known as <b>the</b> Don <b>Jail</b> or <b>The</b> Don. The first King Street Gaol, second King Street Gaol and the Toronto Central Prison were all colloquially known as <b>the</b> Toronto <b>Jail,</b> and <b>the</b> Don <b>Jail</b> likely earned its unofficial name to distinguish it from these other facilities.|$|R

50|$|A new jail wing {{was added}} in 1911 onto {{the rear of}} the courthouse. A plaque mounted on <b>the</b> <b>jail's</b> {{exterior}} commemorates <b>the</b> first hanging to occur there. The December 5, 1911 execution from the third floor gallows happened before <b>the</b> <b>jail's</b> official dedication in January 1912.|$|R
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} the front door of <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to <b>the</b> <b>jail.</b> The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
5|$|The District of Kentucky and the Supreme Court of the District of Kentucky {{were both}} created in 1783. When the court moved to Danville in 1785, it ordered that two men {{determine}} {{the cost of}} constructing the buildings it needed to function, including a courthouse and jail. The report called for assessments {{to be made on}} the district's four counties for the construction of the buildings; Jefferson County was assessed £431, Nelson County £49, Fayette County £86, and Lincoln County £122. Isaac Hite was chosen to construct the buildings, which were finished in 1785. <b>The</b> <b>jail</b> was built {{in the center of the}} square, and the courthouse was situated between <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> and Walnut Street.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of federal authorities, the men were placed on {{lockdown}} in their Obion County, Tennessee, jail cell for their own safety. The two men could leave their cell for only one hour to watch television or use the phone; authorities said they had caused no problems during their time in <b>the</b> <b>jail.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>jails</b> {{encountered}} problems {{almost immediately}} with inmates' limbs being crushed or {{interfering with the}} cellblock's rotation. Most of <b>the</b> <b>jails</b> had to be welded in a fixed position and refitted with individual cell accesses. All of them, except for one, were condemned by June 22, 1939. <b>The</b> Pottawattamie County <b>Jail</b> in Council Bluffs, IA remained in use until 1969.|$|R
40|$|Objective: An {{open cell}} stent system may offer better {{apposition}} of cell struts to vessel wall than a closed cell stent system in acute vasculature. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility of coiling using <b>the</b> <b>jailing</b> technique with <b>the</b> Neuroform EZ stent system. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>jailing</b> technique using <b>the</b> open-cell stent system of the Neuroform EZ stent was planned in 22 consecutive patients with 22 cer-ebral aneurysms. We retrospectively evaluated the technical success of <b>the</b> <b>jailing</b> technique and <b>the</b> occurrence of interference between two micro-catheters as well as the factors influencing this interference. Results: <b>The</b> <b>jailing</b> technique was successful in 19 / 22 patients (86. 4 %), and interference between two microcatheters occurred in 6 / 21 (28. 6 %). <b>The</b> <b>jailing</b> technique failed in 3 / 22 patients, with problems that included failure of the stent delivery system to advance into the positioned micro-catheter in one, interference between the microcatheters during the ad-vancement of the stent delivery system in one, and failure of micro...|$|R

5|$|Founded in 1936, the Bristol Historical Society is {{committed}} to saving, collecting, and promoting historical research and interest in southern New England, with a specific focus on the town of Bristol. Originally, the Bristol Historical Society was located in the Rogers Free Library, but a fire destroyed {{a part of the}} collections on July 27, 1957. <b>The</b> <b>jail,</b> which had been abandoned by the state in June of the same year, was selected by the Society as its new home and leased from the state. In 1972, the Bristol Historical Society was renamed to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society to reflect its preservation interests. In 1973, the Society purchased the Bristol County Jail from the state. The Society restored <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> cells through a matching grant from the National Park Service and opened the cells as a public exhibit.|$|E
5|$|Many {{products}} were specially manufactured {{to commemorate the}} event. Saris, fish knives, betel-leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi's name printed or inscribed on them were made. A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the mahant in <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> oil press. Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894. These items were unique {{in the sense that}} they were the only such commemorative items modelled on an event.|$|E
5|$|The {{third floor}} is a single, unparitioned room that was likely used for storage.

5|$|While {{exploring}} the mansion, Jennifer searches for Mary's true intentions. Depending on choices {{made by the}} player, Jennifer will either discover Simon Barrows trapped in a jail cell, or her father's corpse. If the latter happens, Jennifer will find his death letter that tells of his account concerning Mary Barrows and her twins, Bobby and Dan. It says that he was trapped there for three days, until his death on November 10, 1986. Jennifer then visits a small church. If the player has collected all the necessary items and clues, then she gains access to the underground catacombs of the mansion. Jennifer sees a cloaked figure walking ahead of her; this is Mary. If Lotte {{did not need to}} rescue Jennifer from <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> cell, she can be found dying at an altar, and tells Jennifer about the switches in the clock tower. Otherwise, she rescues Jennifer from <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> cell, but is shot by Mary.|$|E
5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside <b>the</b> <b>jail.</b> While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo {{studied for}} the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After {{returning}} to India {{he took up}} various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested {{in the aftermath of}} a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E

5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, {{city hall}} {{was home to}} the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the {{political}} arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County (which {{at that time was}} the largest county in the colony, extending far past its current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in city hall alongside common criminals. Following the war, city hall was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, in addition to being home to the city and county governments, <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> courts, and local registry.|$|E
5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. <b>The</b> <b>jail</b> had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, {{they were unable to}} see each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book. Because she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at <b>the</b> <b>Jail.</b> There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from <b>the</b> <b>jail,</b> or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E
