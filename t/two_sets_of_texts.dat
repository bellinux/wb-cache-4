Very little existing work explores how user clicks {{can be used}} to improve text matching for Web search. In this paper, we treat user queries that result in clicks as off-page annotations. These queries, like anchor text, provide a valuable additional source of relevance information for Web pages. We call the queries that are used to annotate Web pages in this way the QueryText. We propose using the QueryText as a new weighted textual field for Web pages, where the weights are based on user click behavior. We derive <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> matching features from the new field – BM 25 F-based features and n-gram features.

40|$|The Prague Easter pogrom of 1389 is {{considered}} the most significant outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Bohemia prior to WWII. The impact of this event {{is evidenced by the}} fact that it triggered composition of numerous texts - in Latin, Czech and German, as well as in Hebrew - which captured the experience of the pogrom from different perspectives. Six of such textual compositions exist in Hebrew and may be compared and contrasted in terms of the treatment of the event. They are anchored in various medieval Hebrew literary traditions, ranging from liturgical poetry (Et kol Ha-Tela of rabbi Avigdor Kara) to historiography (Cemach David of David Ganz), and thus use distinct symbolic languages to describe the trauma of the pogrom. The same is true for the compositions in Latin and Czech, particularly for a corpus of five literary texts known as the Passio Iudeorum Pragensium, which employ Christian narrative models. Although the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> - in Hebrew and in Latin - emerged from distinct, even contradictory narrative traditions, they cannot be perceived as independent or unrelated. Rather, they are parts of a single discourse on the nature and purpose of the pogrom violence and strive to contain such a event, traumatic both for the Jews and the Christians.

40|$|Thesis Abstract The present thesis investigates {{correlations}} between a selection <b>of</b> metafictional <b>texts</b> and narrative theory. The selection consists in <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> self-reflexive <b>texts.</b> The first one explores metafictional tendencies in the 17 th and 18 th century novels. To achieve this, the selection largely ignores their provenience. In addition to Henry Fielding's Tom Jones and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, it also examines Cervantes's Don Quixote. The latter <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> focuses on post-War American metafictions (John Barth's Lost in the Funhouse, Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five). These represent a coherent body of works {{from a particular}} period. Metafiction is generally understood as fiction about fiction. The present thesis challenges those assumptions and suggests interpreting metafiction {{within the framework of}} Michel Foucault's epistemes. Metafiction is not conceived of as a separate genre of literature but in the context of broader cultural tendencies in the understanding of representation. Representation is a key concept in metafiction and the increasing degree of narrative self-awareness is viewed in this light. The thesis emphasizes this contrastive and interdisciplinary approach. The text is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is a theoretical [...] ...|$|R

This second question also attempted to find out whether the students would produce more varied or/and sophisticated idiomatic language after an approximately 5 -month long period of focused teaching. The material consisted <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> 60 + <b>texts</b> each, the majority from the students’ end-of-term evaluations. The texts were analyzed, and the number of idioms used counted, each new idiom registered, along with the number of times each idiom occurred in the material as a whole. In the approximately 5 months between the 1 st and 2 nd set being produced, the students participated in regular English classes in which there was placed additional focus on the recognition, interpretation and acquisition of idiomatic language. A combination approach was chosen, including cross-language exploration, memorization, interpreting meaning from context and identification, implementing both explicit and implicit teaching strategies. Idiomatic expressions in the 1 st set were very basic, the majority being phrasal or prepositional verbs. The findings indicate that the students in general developed more advanced idiomatic language between the 1 st and 2 nd sets. There is a notable increase in idioms used, from a total of 146 instances of idiomatic language in the full 1 st <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> to 246 instances in the full 2 nd set. There is also {{an increase in the number}} of different idiomatic expressions used by the students; 163 new idiomatic expressions were registered in the 2 nd set that had not been present in the 1 st set, and a number of these expressions could be traced back to the idiom focused teaching done in the months between the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> being written.

40|$|The {{ethics of}} the Mohist ‘Dialogues’ is largely {{consistent}} {{with that of the}} ‘Triads,’ but the Dialogues present at least four novel extensions of Mohist ethical ideas. First, they clarify the Mohist conception of dào 道 as norms that can be explicitly expressed in yán 言 (statements) and publicized and consistently followed by all with good consequences. Second, they express a series of views on moral worth, which tie it to agents’ character and intentions. Third, they fill out the Mohist view of moral motivation and indicate how the Mohists approach the problem of weakness of will. Fourth, they present a new, highly demanding ideal of moral sagehood. On the whole, the Dialogues present a more demanding conception of the moral life than the Triads do. This difference may be due partly to a general tendency in later generations of the Mohist movement to shift toward more extreme positions. But it can also explained partly by the different audiences to which the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> were directed. Whereas the Triads are addressed primarily to rulers, officials, and gentlemen, most of whom were probably not Mohist followers, the Dialogues appear to be addressed primarily to committed Mohist disciples.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This {{thesis is}} a {{contrastive}} genre study which explores newspaper commentaries on terrorism in Chinese and Australian newspapers. The study examines the textual patterning of the Australian and Chinese commentaries, interpersonal and intertextual {{features of the}} texts as well as considers possible contextual factors which might contribute {{to the formation of}} the newspaper commentaries in the two different languages and cultures. For the framework of its analysis, the study draws on systemic functional linguistics, English for Specific Purposes and new rhetoric genre studies, critical discourse analysis, and discussions {{of the role of the}} mass media in the two different cultures. The study reveals that Chinese writers often use explanatory rather than argumentative expositions in their newspaper commentaries. They seem to distance themselves from outside sources and seldom indicate endorsement of these sources. Australian writers, on the other hand, predominantly use argumentative expositions to argue their points of view. They integrate and manipulate outside sources in various ways to establish and provide support for the views they express. It is argued that these textual and intertextual practices are closely related to contextual factors, especially the roles of the media and opinion discourse in contemporary China and Australia. The study, by providing both a textual and contextual view of the genre under investigation in the two languages and cultures, aims to establish a framework for contrastive rhetoric research which moves beyond the text into the context of production and interpretation of the texts as a way of exploring reasons for the linguistic and rhetorical choices made in the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates whether {{studying}} through English has {{an effect}} on the written texts secondary school students produce in their first language, Spanish. Research in bilingual education has tended to focus on students‟ language proficiency and academic achievement as opposed to investigating differences in discourse norms. However, an increased awareness of the role of discourse in language use and the culturally-specific nature of discourse, along with a growing concern over the dominance of the English language in Europe and elsewhere, have widened the range of questions identified as requiring investigation in bilingual education. Popular understanding suggests that English speakers make different choices from Spanish speakers in particular rhetorical situations. Although research into these contrasts can be problematic, there is support for the existence of cultural preference in the selection of options, and specific areas of similarity and difference between Spanish and English discourse have been suggested. This study then looks at one group of secondary three (3 º E. S. O.) Spanish students studying through English on a Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programme in Spain, and compares <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> argumentative <b>texts</b> written in Spanish by the CLIL students with equivalent texts written by non-CLIL students in the same school. Forty-eight texts are examined in total, and the comparison draws on previous research into discourse differences between Spanish and English texts from contrastive rhetoric, systemic functional linguistics (SFL), and other fields, using tools from SFL for the textual analysis. Areas of analysis include use of clause complexes, multiple Theme and thematic progression, and also genre structure and text organisation strategies for argumentative writing. The main contrasts are found to be in length of t-units, use of simplexes versus complexes, use of multiple Theme, and some issues <b>of</b> <b>text</b> structure. These differences largely correspond to contrasts found in studies comparing written Spanish and written English text, with the CLIL students‟ texts showing features more commonly associated with English writing. Additional data from analysis of the geography textbooks used by the CLIL and non-CLIL students, questionnaires administered to these students, and interviews with their teachers are also used to explore the possible CLIL effect on the students‟ written text. The study discusses how discourse conventions associated with English text in contrast with Spanish text may have influenced the Spanish writing of the CLIL students, considering possibilities including the effect of direct and indirect teaching, and the more general impact of the CLIL programme. Also explored is the question of whether this possible influence of English on Spanish language use is a matter for concern or not, with increased work on language and discourse awareness suggested as a potential response. Methodological issues raised through the study relating to aspects <b>of</b> <b>text</b> analysis and <b>of</b> data collection are also addressed.

5000|$|In 1887, Carl Lederer {{proposed}} that the existence <b>of</b> <b>two</b> apparently contradictory <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> for Pekah could be explained if there really were two systems in use for reckoning the reign of Pekah, and these were the consequence of a rivalry between Pekah and Menahem. The rivalry began when Menahem slew Shallum, {{putting an end to}} Shallum's one-month reign (...) [...] This assumption accounted for all the chronological texts that related four kings of Judah (Uzziah through Hezekiah) to three kings of Israel (Menahem, Pekahiah, and Pekah), but it apparently was largely ignored by the scholarly community. Then in 1954, H. J. Cook added new considerations to support Lederer's thesis, beyond just the pragmatic. Cook maintained that although the Scriptures did not explicitly state the existence of two rival kingdoms in the north {{in the latter half of}} the eighth century BC, their existence could be inferred from passages of the book of Hosea that was written about the time of Pekah and Menahem. Cook showed that although [...] "Ephraim" [...] is sometimes used in Scripture to designate all of the northern kingdom, in various passages of Hosea such as Hosea 5:5, [...] "Israel" [...] and [...] "Ephraim" [...] are not synonymous but refer to separate entities. Cook's thesis in this regard was strengthened when Rodger Young pointed out that the Hebrew of Hosea 5:5 has a vav before Israel and then another vav before Ephraim, which is the Hebrew method of expressing [...] "both[...] [...] and," [...] implying a distinction in this passage between Israel and Ephraim. All translations which have rendered this in some sense as [...] "Israel, even Ephraim" [...] are therefore incorrect (the Holman Study Bible renders the verse correctly, as did the ancient Septuagint). Others who have accepted the Lederer/Cook explanation of the two methods of dating for the time of Pekah are Thiele in his second edition of Mysterious Numbers and later, Leslie McFall, Francis Andersen and David Noel Freedman in their commentary on Hosea in the Anchor Bible Series, T. C. Mitchell, in the Cambridge Ancient History, and Jack Finegan in his Handbook of Biblical Chronology.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is the highly specialized and stylized liturgical language of Russian Church Slavonic (RCS). Historically, RCS has been strictly controlled by authorities and has conformed to established norms, but innovations have nevertheless arisen in response to various conditions. One major wave of innovations was a long, deliberate process, spanning the 16 th- 18 th centuries, {{which led to the}} codification of RCS grammar and the renovation <b>of</b> liturgical <b>texts.</b> Another wave <b>of</b> innovations in RCS was incidental and took place following a sudden upheaval, namely the Bolshevik Revolution and the subsequent repression of religion in the Soviet Union. A diaspora situation was created in which hymnographers were cut off from traditional institutional structures, and the ultimate result was freedom for the hymnographer to innovate. The hymns of Valeria Hoecke, an autodidact who composed in Serbia and East Germany, show what can happen in diaspora. This work discusses both phases: the reforms of the 16 th- 18 th centuries as seen in canonical hymns used now, and the example of hymns written in the diaspora, as seen in the work of this one writer. 	Two aspects of hymnography are analyzed: use of person and perspective, and use of verbs and participles to comprise the global hymn structure. <b>Two</b> major <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> are analyzed. The first includes various texts that were edited in the 16 th- 18 th centuries, at the time of reforms in the past tense system. Among other things, these reforms resulted in the codification of a rule for the use of past tense forms, according to which only the perfect form is used with the 2 nd-person singular subject. Reformed texts discussed here include the Great Canon of Andrew of Crete and the Menaion. The Great Canon is a text in which a repentant sinner engages his own soul in dialogue. The nature of the identities of the speaker and the addressee are analyzed, {{as well as that of}} other persons mentioned in this text. The Menaion is a collection of hymns addressed to saints for each day of the liturgical year. It too is analyzed in terms of person and viewpoint. Here, however, the bulk of the discussion of the Menaion relates to the operation of verbs and participles within the reformed past tense system. The second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> includes twenty-seven liturgical pieces composed by the 20 th century hymnographer Valeria Hoecke; these are compared and contrasted with the older texts. In addition, Hoecke's biography is presented, including new information gained from archival work in Belgrade. 	This work finds a correlation among tense, person, and genre in RCS. RCS narrative is either exocentric or endocentric, and primarily features the first and third persons. The realm of the second person is in the genre of discourse. In RCS, discourse is the genre of possibilities and options, whereas narrative is the genre of constativity, specificity, and the pinning down of events within time. It is argued here that the discourse-specific niche for the second person may have led to the formal (reformed), past tense based differentiation in the context of the RCS liturgical language. 	The 16 th- 18 th century language reforms stipulated, among other things, an automatic correlation of past tense verbal form and grammatical person. This work finds that there is also a difference in temporal semantics between events expressed by 2 nd- and non- 2 nd person verb forms. Second-person events (those that are addressed to saints and that describe a saint's actions) tend to be related causally, and conjunct participles play a key role in causal sequencing. Non-second-person events, however, behave differently: some pair with sequencing conjunct participles, whereas others do not. It is argued that the past tense reforms actually led to the evolution of a semantic distinction among the possible depictions of the events a certain subject can engage in. 	Many of the 20 th century hymns by Valeria Hoecke are canonical both in terms of person and viewpoint structure, and in verb and participle use. This shows that she understands how earlier hymns are constructed and that she continues this tradition. But her work also shows marked innovations from the tradition in that the focus is on the speaker as a self-conscious individual. The reader becomes a speaker, a participant in the text, when he maps Hoecke's textual "I" onto himself. Innovations in Hoecke's hymns also include her use of long strings of attributive participles, long strings of dative participles in dative absolute constructions, and strings of conjunct participles unmatched with corresponding finite verbs.

My research {{is a historical}} comparison of <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> published in the years 1996 - 1997 and 2005 - 2007 focusing on visual representations portraying gender roles {{with the purpose of}} ascertaining if progress is being made towards this objective. I analyze a total of six books, three books from 1996 - 1997 and three from 2005 - 2007. The examined textbooks include two second grade Natural Sciences, two fourth grade Spanish, and two sixth grade Social Sciences with each subject including one text from 1996 - 1997 and one from 2005 - 2007. I examine the textbooks to determine whether the visual images of males and females are 2 ̆ 2 sex-fair 2 ̆ 2 and/or 2 ̆ 2 sex-affirmative 2 ̆ 2 (concepts developed by Scott and Schau [1985]). Sex-fair texts have females appearing in half of the number of images and the images portray both females and males equally in all societal roles whether they are culturally traditional or not. Sex-affirmative texts stress the portrayal of females and males in roles opposite their traditional role (Eklund Koza, 1994). I conclude that according to the six texts analayzed, female stereotyped images have reduced, but male stereotyped images have increased. Therefore, the Dominican government has been successful to some extent in taking steps towards the elimination of gender stereotypes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wide}} field of genre analysis, {{a number of}} studies have been devoted to the {{examination}} of research articles (RAs), which are considered the central genre of knowledge production (Swales, 1990 and 2004; Bhatia, 1993). Most prominent has been work on the organizational patterns of RA sections such as Introduction and Discussion (Swales, 1990; Dudley-Evans, 1994; Holmes, 1997), and particular text features such as hedges and modality (Hyland, 1996 and 2005; Salager-Meyer, 1992). Nowadays the growing tendency to examine RAs from a cross-disciplinary perspective (Bamford and Bondi, 2005; Hyland and Bondi, 2006) has not been accompanied by a burgeoning interest in genre variation across languages. In an attempt to partially fill this gap, this study analyses the closing portions of a selection of business RAs written in English and Italian. Data for this investigation consist of two comparable corpora of Discussions and Conclusioni drawn from some of the articles published in six specialised journals in 2000 (Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly and Marketing Science; Economia e Management, Studi Organizzativi and Micro Macro Marketing). With the support of corpus linguistic tools such as wordlists, concordances and collocates, the paper sheds some light on the similarities and differences which characterize the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> in terms of some rhetorical, content and metadiscursive elements (Vande Kopple, 1985; Crismore et al. 1993; Hyland, 2005). On the assumption that metadiscourse plays a crucial role in directing the reader and showing him/her how to understand what is said by the author, considerable attention is paid to the metadiscursive elements which are deployed in English and in Italian to present research findings and convince the addressee of the truthfulness and trustworthiness of the results presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how the Rapture {{fiction and}} popular prophecy of modern American premillennial dispensationalism shapes the eschatological beliefs of its readership. This will be {{accomplished}} through a text-based {{critical analysis of}} the anxiety narratives of the Bible study and exegetical guides of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library, and its counterpart, the Left Behind fiction series. This thesis represents the first scholarly analysis of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library, and the first situation of Left Behind fiction within its theological context. It will be proposed that these <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> shape the eschatological beliefs of their readers through a discursive ‘streamlining’ that is performed in several ways. Firstly, {{the historical development of}} the movement will be examined, exploring the evolution of a specific premillennial dispensationalist hermeneutic and its ‘channelling’ through particular cultural institutions. Secondly, an analysis of the Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library and Left Behind fiction will demonstrate that this premillennial dispensationalist hermeneutic is almost exclusively communicated through anxiety narratives which focus on expressions of horror, isolation, powerlessness and paranoia. It will be argued that these narratives serve to explore ‘abjective’ elements of premillennial dispensationalist belief, re-integrating them into the fabric of the faith. Particular attention will be paid to these abjective elements, which include the role of the eschatological body, the nature of individual salvation, and the perpetual deferment of the Rapture. As such, the popular media of premillennial dispensationalism serves as a further channel for the discursive streamlining of the movement’s prophetic scheme. Finally, this thesis proposes that the ‘deprivation’ theory of millennial appeal does not adequately explain the appeal and success of premillennial dispensationalism. As such, the following analysis will suggest that an alternate critical analysis of the movement, concentrating on its tropes of anxiety, serves to better explain the continued appeal of this ideology. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E

40|$|A text can {{be defined}} as a word w {{together}} with a (second) linear order on its domain f 1; :::; jwjg. This second order may be used to define a hierarchical, tree-like, structure representing the <b>text.</b> The family <b>of</b> context-free <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> is investigated, i. e., <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> defined by context-free text grammars. In particular, those <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> are studied in the framework of universal algebra. This allows to compare the classical notions of equational and recognizable families in an algebra with context-free sets in the "algebra of texts". Within this algebra the notion <b>of</b> equational <b>sets</b> coincides with the context-free sets. A grammatical characterization of the family <b>of</b> recognizable <b>sets</b> is given as a subfamily <b>of</b> the context-free <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> 1 Introduction This paper further investigates the class <b>of</b> context-free <b>texts,</b> that was introduced in [9] generalizing context-free word grammars to the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> The notion <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> itself generalizes the notion of a wor [...] ...|$|R
