Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005.

500|$|Wallace {{described}} himself as being at first reluctant to try {{it because of the}} aroma, [...] "but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater." [...] He cited one traveller from 1599: [...] "it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it." [...] He cites another writer: [...] "To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it." [...] Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery {{decided to}} try {{draining}} some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it {{under the name of}} Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saignée method. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation, so he added [...] "White Zinfandel" [...] to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make [...] "white" [...] wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. [...] However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, then <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Rosé had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian Girolamo Benzoni in {{his book}} La Historia del Mondo Nuovo (1565) wrote that [...] "...chocolate seemed more like a drink for pigs than a drink to be {{consumed}} by humans," [...] noting {{that he had never}} <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> despite residing there for over a year. José de Acosta also disparaged the drink, comparing the frothy foam capping chocolate to feces. Despite these caveats, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo characterised it as an interesting ingredient, while showing some reluctance to describe how some Indians, after drinking it, had stained their lips as if they had ingested human blood.|$|E
2500|$|Fronto {{had warned}} Marcus against {{the study of}} {{philosophy}} early on: [...] "it is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy...than to have <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> superficially, {{with the edge of}} the lips, as the saying is". He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle. Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' [...] "conversion to philosophy": [...] "in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training. Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.|$|E

[...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> and sighed again {{and shook his head}} {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E

According to Polyaenus, on discovering the dining hall of the Persian royal palace, Alexander the Great mocked their taste and blamed it for their defeat. Pausanias, on discovering the dining habits of the Persian commander Mardonius, equally ridiculed the Persians, [...] "who having so much, came to rob the Greeks of their miserable living".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his rule}} in Kabul, {{when there was}} a time of {{relative}} peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening. Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first <b>tasted</b> <b>it</b> at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from opium. Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: [...] "I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober". He quit drinking for health reasons before the Battle of Khanwa, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, [...] "Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of abstinence); I swore the oath and regret that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, [...] "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever <b>tasted.</b> <b>It</b> was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The charges {{included}} four {{counts of}} administering alcohol to a minor, which the jury could find was done either {{with intent to}} molest (a felony charge), or without (a misdemeanor). [...] All three Arvizo children testified that Michael Jackson had served them alcohol. Gavin testified {{that the first time}} he ever drank alcohol was in the wine cellar with Jackson, where he allegedly swallowed a quantity of vodka thinking it was water. He testified that after the Miami trip, he was drinking wine, vodka, rum, or bourbon every night that Jackson was home. [...] However, in an earlier police interview, he said he [...] "didn't drink a lot" [...] at Neverland. The prosecution's [...] "grooming" [...] theory held that Jackson used alcohol to lower Gavin's inhibitions in order to molest him, and the accuser testified that the first time he was molested, he and Jackson had just come [...] "back from drinking in the arcade." [...] He also described a time when he was undergoing urine tests related to his cancer treatment, and he worried alcohol would be detected, but was allegedly pressured by Jackson to drink anyway and not take the test. Star's first time drinking alcohol, he claimed, was on the flight back from Miami. [...] Jackson allegedly handed him a Diet Coke can filled with wine. Star testified {{he did not know what}} the drink was when he <b>tasted</b> <b>it,</b> and that it reminded him of the smell of rubbing alcohol (a comparison Gavin also made). Star said Gavin and Michael were sharing the soda can and acting [...] "really weird." [...] However, Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant who had served Jackson on the Miami flight and other flights, testified that she never saw him share his drink with Gavin. She testified that she had devised the custom of serving Jackson wine in Diet Coke cans during flights, because Michael Jackson didn't like to drink alcohol in front of his children.|$|E
