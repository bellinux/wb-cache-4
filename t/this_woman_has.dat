500|$|In December 2007, tabloid {{websites}} {{and magazines}} reported that Parker {{had been having}} an extramarital affair with supposed model Alexandra Paressant. Both Parker and Longoria vehemently denied these allegations through their spokespeople, saying [...] "All high profile couples fall victim to these sorts {{of things in the}} course of their relationships. It appears that this is not the first time <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> used an athlete to gain public notoriety." [...] Parker initiated a $20 million lawsuit against the website that first reported the story, which later issued a full retraction and an apology, stating [...] "X17online.com and X7 , Inc. regret having been misled by Ms. Paressant and her representatives and apologize to Mr. Parker for any damage or inconvenience this may have caused him or his wife." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Bishop Javier Echeverria, the Prelate of Opus Dei, â€œOn January 10, 2004, in the homily of {{her funeral}} mass, I stated that 'Dora has great {{importance}} for Opus Dei.' I was convinced then {{and with the}} passing of time becoming even more convinced of the important role that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> played and will play {{in the life of the}} Church and in society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{condemnation}} of an Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani {{for the crime}} of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that [...] "I need to respect the laws of a [...] country. If my friendship {{with the president of}} Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil." [...] The Iranian government, however, declined the offer. Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government. Jackson Diehl, Deputy editorial page Editor of The Washington Post, called Lula da Silva the [...] "best friend of tyrants in the democratic world" [...] and criticised his actions. Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a [...] "powerful message to the Islamic Republic." ...|$|E

60|$|Rufus {{would have}} spoken out {{to any other}} woman in the universe. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> {{preserved}} him from ridicule--this <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> rubbed his head dry. He prevaricated.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Carlyon {{smiled at}} her sudden enthusiasm. After all, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> fire. She {{was too much of}} the artist to be without it.|$|R

60|$|Feeling that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> {{the better}} of it, with her calm, polished, highbred sarcasms, I {{walked back to the}} 'pike, full of hopes of a sweet revenge.|$|R
5000|$|Actor Martin Landau said Taylor [...] "was {{almost like}} <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> found {{her way into}} the theatre, through the stage door, and was sort of {{wandering}} around the kitchen".|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, but," [...] {{returned}} the captain, with some asperity, [...] "you {{tell me that}} <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> fair hair slightly grey, delicate features, pale complexion, brown eyes, and gentle manners, {{all of which are}} facts!" ...|$|E
60|$|So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> to {{keep these}} raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's {{thoughts}} take such form as he looks at her, with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will not}} avail us, Deliverer," [...] {{answered}} Olfan, [...] "for these doors are made fast without by bars of stone thicker than my arm. Now <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> gone to rouse {{the college of}} the priests, who will presently come to kill us like caged rats." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The <b>woman</b> he <b>had</b> {{just met}} and {{fallen in love}} with. Before that it was {{immaterial}} to him {{what had become of}} his wife. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> said to him: 'Come back to me a free man or never see my face again.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{straight}} {{to your room}} and stay there," [...] she said, and closing the door, glanced at Hetty. [...] "It is quite simple. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> taken your note-paper and written Larry. He is in the bluff now, and I think she is right. Your friends mean to make him prisoner or shoot him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's power here," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews {{with his}} forefinger. [...] "Very few men {{have the power}} of wrist that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has.</b> It's {{remarkable}} what mere force of grip there is in these hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother what Miss Dorothy says! Miss Dorothy {{only knows}} what it has suited that scamp, her brother, to tell her. I {{understand}} <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> come away because of a lover; and if that's so, my sister-in-law is very wrong to receive her. The temptation of the Clock House has been too much for her. It's not my doing; that's all." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the Saudi Gazette {{reported}} that a 23-year-old, unmarried woman was sentenced to one year in prison and 100 lashes for adultery. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> been gang-raped, became pregnant, and had tried (unsuccessfully) to abort the fetus.

6000|$|... "Spoke harshly! Now that I {{have had}} time to think of it, I wish that I could have had ten imaginations to shape my thoughts, and ten tongues to speak them with! Do you {{understand}} what <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> done? She has sold herself to a brute--oh, Mildred, such a brute--she has deserted me for a man who is not even a gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have bungled the affair, Foster. It is not well-managed; {{it is not}} clever. You were to {{have brought}} him to me, to have let me know the instant he reached Paris. I would have seen him. Just as he was, I should have succeeded. Now {{it may be that}} <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> warned him already. She is very clever. If she has him, he will not escape." ...|$|E
60|$|As BLOODY QUEEN MARY, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> become famous, and as BLOODY QUEEN MARY, {{she will}} ever be justly remembered with horror and detestation in Great Britain. Her memory has been held in such abhorrence that some writers have arisen in later years to take her part, and to show that she was, upon the whole, quite an amiable and cheerful sovereign! 'By their fruits ye shall know them,' said OUR SAVIOUR. The stake and the fire were the fruits of this reign, and you will judge this Queen by nothing else.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> {{also had}} a little school, which she kept to teach {{children}} to read and to work; and having, as I have said, lived before that in good fashion, she bred up the children she took {{with a great deal}} of art, as well as {{with a great deal of}} care.|$|R
60|$|Rose was magnificent, masterful. She was flaming {{hot with}} wrath. <b>This</b> little <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> gone too far.|$|R

6000|$|... "There are {{objections}} to the joke theory, no doubt," [...] said he, [...] "but there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another word like that, sir, and I {{shall be}} {{compelled}} {{to ask you to}} leave the house. I believe that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> been tampered with by no one. I will now learn from her what is her remembrance of the circumstances as they occurred twenty years since, and I will then read to you her deposition. I shall be sorry, gentlemen, to keep you here, perhaps for an hour or so, but you will find the morning papers on the table." [...] And then Mr. Round, gathering up certain documents, passed into the outer office, and Mr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath were left alone.|$|E
6000|$|We {{prepared}} everything, and {{he instructed}} {{me in my}} part as assistant. He had not told Bertha of his absolute conviction that Archer would not survive through the night, and endeavoured to persuade her to leave the patient and take a night's rest. But she was obstinate, suspecting the fact that death was at hand, and supposing that he wished merely to save her nerves. She refused to leave the sick-room. Meunier and I sat up together in the library, he making frequent visits to the sick-room, and returning with the information that the case was taking precisely the course he expected. Once he said to me, [...] "Can you imagine any cause of ill-feeling <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> against her mistress, who is so devoted to her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Telford had {{a curious}} {{experience}} at that moment. He seemed to see, looking {{out from behind}} this external mask of degraded beauty, the semblance of what <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> might <b>have</b> been under more favouring circumstance of birth and environment, wherein her rich, passionate nature, potent for either good or evil, might have been trained and swayed aright until it had developed grandly out into the glorious womanhood the Creator must have planned for her. He knew, as if by revelation, that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing in common with}} the narrow, self-righteous souls of Rykman's Corner. Warped and perverted though her nature might be, she was yet far nobler than those who sat in judgement upon her.|$|R

"When I {{returned}} to London I called upon the milliner, who had recognized Straker as an excellent customer {{of the name}} of Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses.
