5|$|When {{the boys}} regain consciousness, they are {{backstage}} at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns on one of <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
5|$|With {{his budget}} {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>microphone</b> arm of {{headsets}} {{may carry}} an external microphone or {{be of the}} voicetube type.

5000|$|In {{a signal}} flow {{beginning}} with an acoustic sound source (such as {{a musical instrument}} or singer), <b>the</b> <b>Microphone</b> preamplifier is typically the first electronically adjustable gain stage, where the signal is amplified {{by as much as}} 95 dB in exceptional cases [...] Before reaching <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> <b>the</b> sound source is subject to the Inverse-square law, which states that sound intensity diminishes as distance between the sound source and <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> increases. This means that (1) moving <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> closer to <b>the</b> sound source increases the signal level produced by <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> and (2) moving <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> farther away from undesirable noise sources will diminish the amount of noise in <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> signal.

5000|$|Phantom {{power can}} be {{supplied}} to a condenser microphone using center tap transformers.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>microphones</b> detect pitch using {{digital signal}} processing, which {{analyses}} {{the frequency of}} the incoming signal via Fast Fourier transform. The frequency is then compared to stored information to evaluate if the note is correct. Regular singing segments do not feature speech recognition, and so humming into <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> at the correct pitch will also score points. Rap sections use a combination of speech recognition and rhythm detection.|$|E

25|$|In some conferences, sound {{engineers}} {{have to provide}} microphones for {{a large number of}} people who are speaking, in the case of a panel conference or debate. In some cases, automatic mixers are used to control the levels of <b>the</b> <b>microphones,</b> and turn off the channels for microphones which are not being spoken into, to reduce unwanted background noise and reduce the likelihood of feedback.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> <b>the</b> signal passes down a {{cable to}} <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> preamplifier, which amplifies <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> signal to line level. This is {{important}} because a line-level signal is necessary to drive the input circuitry of any further processing equipment down the chain, which will generally {{not be able to}} accept the extremely low-voltage signal produced by a typical microphone.|$|R

25|$|There {{were some}} {{technical}} problems with <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> and Melody had to restart her performance. Once the semi-final was over, the dance company Los Vivancos announced their {{withdrawal from the}} competition {{due to the lack}} of technical and artistic resources in the production of the show, and because their bid was being promoted as Melody even though it was a joint bid. Melody announced that she would go on in the competition with some other dancers.|$|E
25|$|Some drummers {{arrive at}} the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands {{provided}} by the venue's sound engineer. Other drummers bring their all of their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., a good quality bass drum mic and a good mic for the snare) {{to ensure that they}} have good quality mics for each show. In bars and nightclubs, <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{games were}} {{televised}} on Fox in the United States with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver (himself a former Phillies broadcaster) as booth announcers and Chris Myers and Ken Rosenthal as field reporters. Jeanne Zelasko hosted the pre-game and post-game show with Kevin Kennedy and Mark Grace (Games 1, 2) or Eric Karros (Games 3, 4, 5).

50|$|A pop filter or pop shield is a noise {{protection}} filter for microphones, typically {{used in a}} recording studio. It serves to reduce or eliminate 'popping' sounds caused by the mechanical impact of fast moving air on <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> during recorded speech and singing. It also keeps moisture off <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> which can cause mold growth. Additionally, a pop filter can protect against the accumulation of saliva on <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> element. Salts in human saliva are corrosive and thus use of a pop filter may improve the life of <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
25|$|Brian Hennessey, vice {{president}} of the Vineeta Foundation, which is making a documentary on Carter, alleged to the Forward that he witnessed G.W. Hillel director Robert Fishman and several Jewish students conspiring to control the Q session. According to Hennessey, a handout was distributed with negative questions and then the students strategically grabbed the seats closest to <b>the</b> <b>microphones.</b> Hennessey said that he overheard people in the group saying that the point of their strategy was to make sure that Carter, whose book, Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, faced only tough questions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E
25|$|During {{several points}} in the Stammheim trial, <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> were turned off while {{defendants}} were speaking, they were often expelled from the hall, and other actions were taken. It was later revealed that the conversation they had between them as well with their attorneys were recorded. Finally it was reported by both the defendants' attorneys {{and some of the}} prison's doctors, that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they couldn't attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately. By the time the Stammheim trial began in early 1975, some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years.|$|E
50|$|For vocal {{applications}} on stage, {{an optical}} microphone switch may be used. An infra-red sensor senses {{if somebody is}} in front of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and switches on <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a directional microphone mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of <b>the</b> directional <b>microphone</b> in a given situation. Typically, <b>the</b> omnidirectional <b>microphone</b> mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas <b>the</b> directional <b>microphone</b> is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). <b>The</b> <b>microphone</b> mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> mode.|$|R
50|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and speaker, {{additional}} circuitry {{is incorporated}} {{to prevent the}} incoming speaker signal and <b>the</b> outgoing <b>microphone</b> signal from interfering with each other. This is accomplished through a hybrid coil (A3). The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1). Since the current path A8 - A3 has a far lower impedance than <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> (A2), {{virtually all of the}} incoming signal passes through it and bypasses <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
25|$|Then an Evergreen State College student, Phil Elverum of <b>The</b> <b>Microphones</b> {{recorded}} his first album, Tests, after being given {{the keys to}} the studio. Elverum became a fixture of the Dub Narcotic control room. Among albums recorded by Elverum at the studio were the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The debut record by Arrington de Dionyso, an Evergreen student with an internship at K, was recorded and released on K as Old Time Relijun. Elverum also recorded Mirah Tov Zeitlyn, known as Mirah, at the studio. These acts helped define a new era of the K Records sound, which shifted its emphasis and started producing records known for their experimental production techniques while maintaining their lo-fi authenticity.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{recording}} {{which developed}} {{during the time that}} early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> and amplifiers used in radio studios. The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement. Alternatively, the Wente style condenser microphone used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones.|$|E
25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} user's manual {{describing the}} operation and the essential features of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> location program is presented. <b>The</b> <b>Microphone</b> Location Program determines microphone locations that ensure accurate and stable results from the equation system used to calculate modal structures.

50|$|The {{directionality}} of the 77-DX is variable. A rotating backshutter on {{the acoustic}} labyrinth, {{controlled by a}} screwdriver-operated slot {{at the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> allows <b>the</b> user to vary <b>the</b> <b>microphone's</b> pattern from omnidirectional in the fully closed position, to cardioid, to figure-8 (bidirectional) in the fully open position.

2500|$|A microphone's {{directionality}} or {{polar pattern}} indicates how sensitive {{it is to}} sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis. [...] The polar patterns illustrated above represent the locus of points that produce the same signal level output in <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> if a given sound pressure level (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> design. For large-membrane microphones {{such as in the}} Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> body, commonly known as [...] "side fire" [...] or [...] "side address".
