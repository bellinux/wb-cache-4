25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. Self-adjusting brakes were added in 1959.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, a {{widening}} gap had existed between the classes; Perón hoped to close it through the increase of wages and employment, making the nation more pluralistic and less reliant on foreign trade. Before taking office in 1946, President Perón took dramatic steps which he believed would result in a more economically independent Argentina, better insulated from events such as World War II. He <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> another international war. The reduced availability of imports and the war's beneficial effects on both the quantity and price of Argentine exports had combined to create a US$1.7billion cumulative surplus during those years.|$|E

50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a New Zealand {{round at}} the new Hampton Downs Motorsport Park, however the circuit did not host a round of the 2009-10 season.|$|R
50|$|They {{have one}} {{daughter}} born in 1934 - 11 {{years after they}} married and <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no children. Her name is Coral, after his buddy Harry’s daughter.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{suffering}} a heavy defeat that could eliminate them, Rose worked out that if they batted first and declared within the first seven balls of their batting innings, it would not matter if they lost, as their bowling strike rate could not suffer sufficiently {{for them to be}} knocked out. There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial. He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> repercussions if they went ahead with the plan. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would [...] "support the team whatever their decision".|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Marks {{wrote that}} the German foreign office, {{supported}} by military and civilian notables, [...] "focused on Article 231... hoping that, if one could refute German responsibility for the war, not only reparations but the entire treaty would collapse". Manfred Boemeke, Gerald Feldman, and Elisabeth Glaser wrote that [...] "pragmatic requirements characteristically influenced the shaping of the much misunderstood Article 231. That paragraph reflected the presumed legal necessity to define German responsibility {{for the war in}} order to specify and limit the Reich's obligations". P.M.H. Bell wrote that despite the article not using the term 'guilt', and while [...] "it may be that its drafters did not intend to convey a moral judgement of Germany", the article has [...] "almost universally" [...] became known as the war guilt clause of the treaty. Margaret MacMillan {{wrote that the}} German public's interpretation of Article 231 as unequivocally ascribing the fault for the war to Germany and her allies, [...] "came to be the object of particular loathing in Germany and the cause of uneasy consciences among the Allies." [...] The Allies never expected such a hostile reaction, for [...] "no one <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> any difficulty over the clauses themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|We are {{disappointed}} with Ostend. We thought that Ostend <b>would</b> <b>be</b> gay and crowded. We <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> bands and theatres and concerts, and busy table-d'hotes, and lively sands, and thronged parades, and pretty girls at Ostend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Rad," [...] said Luke at last in deep puzzlement, [...] "has never {{raised his}} voice once. I <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a row--that he would turn the man out of the house. Dear old chap! he hasn't much {{patience}} as a rule." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{a related}} front, {{many of the}} sailors who had signed up for long periods during the war were finding {{themselves}} dissatisfied with peacetime duties and conditions. Some attempted to secure a discharge as they <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better opportunities and pay in civilian jobs, but demobilisation efforts were focused on the personnel who had signed up under [...] "Hostilities Only" [...] conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Video game reviewers from gaming {{websites}} {{and magazines}} mainly criticized {{the game for}} the Xbox Live Vision Camera bundled with the game. Even before the game's release, EyeToy's Sandy Spangler <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> some technical difficulties with players; he stated, [...] "They're using some technical elements that are not reliable, at least not according to our experience. They're using background subtraction {{to put you in}} the movie, and it's not very robust, that's why we haven't done it in any of our games." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 2000, the hip hop {{scene in}} Japan has grown and diversified. Hip-hop style and Japanese rap has been {{enormously}} commercially successful in Japan. In a 2003 {{interview with the}} BBC, Tokyo record-store owner, Hideaki Tamura noted [...] "Japanese hip-hop really exploded in the last two, three years. I never <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a time when Japanese records could outsell American ones but it's happening." [...] Additionally, {{a huge number of}} new scenes have developed. These include “rock rap to hard core gangsta, spoken word/poetry, to conscious, old school, techno rap, antigovernment, pro-marijuana, heavymetal-sampled rap, and so on.” ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he heard}} this Kilweh felt proud and happy. Surely {{he must be}} a man now, he <b>thought,</b> or <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no talk of a wife for him, and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride, and what she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like when he beheld her.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{a servant}} of my uncle's. We <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{sure to be}} war, sooner or later; and that, after it <b>was</b> over, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{a good chance of}} {{profitable}} trade on the Burmese rivers. I had no great difficulty in learning it from my uncle's man, who was a native of Aracan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, aye," [...] {{said the}} stranger, smiling. [...] "I know it very well. But you've not got many Methodists about here, surely--in this {{agricultural}} spot? I should have <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> hardly <b>be</b> {{such a thing}} as a Methodist to be found about here. You're all farmers, aren't you? The Methodists can seldom lay much hold on THEM." ...|$|R
2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E

I {{know you}} {{always told me}} to take it with me, {{thinking}} that it might come in useful, and I carried it under my saddle all the time we were in Wales; but, seeing that this was but a ride to Jedburgh and back, I <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no occasion for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|We all <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no Jews {{here today}} in 2012. And {{to see the}} amount of Jews that {{actually}} {{take part in the}} Menorah center and in the synagogue, in the Golden Rose synagogue, the activities here—it’s hard to believe. I actually think this is the center for Jewish community and the center for thriving and there has been an incredible revival.|$|R
50|$|Outside the bunker, Harry is {{told the}} plane is now safe and Ruth joins him on the hillside. Ruth tells him that the reason she left <b>was</b> because she <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> always <b>be</b> too many secrets between them and that one day she might lose herself in the secrets... but that hasn't happened. She then asks Harry to leave the Service with her, retire where {{they can have a}} life together.|$|R

60|$|His father, however, {{after looking}} at his watch, said that he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> time to go. So he turned his horse's head in the right direction, {{and they went to}} the cliffs.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, Ito {{opened a}} cafe named Matsuri (Carnival) in Shinjuku {{as a social}} space for Barazokus readers. Ito <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> so many {{visitors}} who <b>would</b> dare to <b>be</b> seen as gay, but the cafe instantly became a very popular place and Ito needed to open multiple locations when the first Matsuri was unable to handle all the visitors. Another cafe, Ribonnu (Ribbon Girl), was opened for lesbian clientele in the same district.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> {{initially}} <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{no benefit}} to consumers for TV1 {{to switch from}} 4:3 to 16:9, as most of its programming was in 4:3. However, recent additions to TV1's programming schedule has resulted in increased 16:9 content. This meant that moving to a widescreen format <b>would,</b> in fact, <b>be</b> {{the best choice for}} TV1 as it would accommodate the increasing number of widescreen programs that it originally cropped to a 4:3 or 14:9 ratio.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> twenty," [...] said Mr. Ratler. [...] "I {{never went}} beyond that. I {{knew they would}} have old Moody up, but I thought Gunning {{would have been too}} hard for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lot on}} 'em!" [...] cried Eliza, who was cook. [...] "And I put off {{the baking}} to-day because I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> bread plenty to fit while morning. We shall never have enow." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{insisted on}} seeing her {{as far as}} the bus. It was a soft, mild night; and they walked round the Circle to Gloucester Gate. He <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more room in the buses at that point.|$|E
60|$|It was {{now nearly}} nine o'clock, and, of course, three hours {{remained}} {{before the time}} of embarkation <b>would</b> arrive. Rollo <b>was</b> not sorry for this, as he <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> enough to amuse and occupy him all this time on and around the pier. His first duty, however, was to go and report himself to Mr. George as having returned from his walk. This he did. He found his uncle very busy in his room, writing his journal.|$|R
6000|$|She brought it, and I {{turned to}} the title-page, where I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> some English, and so there was. “There!” said I. “Look at that! ‘London: Printed for the British and Foreign Bible Society, Blackfriars,’ and the date, which I can’t read, owing to its being in these X’s. There’s no devil in hell can look near the Bible Society, Blackfriars. Why, you silly!” I said, “how do you suppose we get along with our own aitus at home? All Bible Society!” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{scale of}} traffic growth envisaged would soon {{overtake}} any benefits that small-scale road improvement would offer, which would anyway {{divert attention from}} the large-scale solutions that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed. These solutions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs. However, the report saw no turning back from people's new-found dependence on the car, and <b>thought</b> that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> limits to how much traffic could be transferred to railways and buses.|$|R
