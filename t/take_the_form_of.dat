5|$|Various {{regions of}} Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a firefly and hunts children. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|According to Plateau's laws, the {{circular}} arcs in two-dimensional soap bubble clusters meet at 120° angles, the same angle {{found at the}} corners of a Reuleaux triangle. Based on this fact, it is possible to construct clusters in which some of the bubbles <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of Cortana <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> two nested, animated circles which are animated to indicate {{activities such as}} searching or talking. The main color scheme includes a black or white background and shades of blue for the respective circles.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival at}} each time period, Cortez <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{a person from}} that {{particular}} period of time, similar to Quantum Leap.

2500|$|In {{her article}} [...] "Can the Subaltern Speak?" [...] philosopher Gayatri Spivak {{discusses}} how sati <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> regulating women in pre-colonial India according to Hindu law, and how sati <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> imprisoning {{women in the}} double bind of self-expression attributed to mental illness and social rejection, or of self-incrimination according to British colonial law. The woman who commits sati <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subaltern in Spivak's work, a <b>form</b> much <b>of</b> postcolonial studies takes very seriously.|$|R

5|$|A URI {{reference}} may <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a full URI, the scheme-specific {{portion of}} a full URI, a trailing component of a full URI, or the empty string. An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present {{at the end of}} a URI reference. The part of the reference before the # indirectly identifies a resource, and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.|$|E
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female {{for weeks at a}} time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E

5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance {{with the}} earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E
5|$|Like John of Tynemouth, {{a number}} of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are {{ascribed}} to Simon. These <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> notes from his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student notes from his lectures, this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.|$|E
5|$|Many people, {{including}} Fudge, do {{not believe}} Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, and as Fudge has the Dementor's Kiss performed, Crouch Jr. is unable to give testimony. Hermione discovers Rita Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, who can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a beetle, and blackmails her to force her to stop writing her libellous stories. Not wanting his tournament winnings, Harry gives them to Fred and George to start their joke shop and returns home with the Dursleys.|$|E
50|$|For any {{two points}} p and q in the plane, let Rpq be {{the set of}} points for which angle prq is greater than θ. Then Rpq <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a union of two open disks with {{diameter}} βd(p,q) for β ≥ 1 and θ ≤ π/2, and it <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection of two open disks with diameter d(p,q)/β for β ≤ 1 and θ ≥ π/2. When β = 1 the two formulas give the same value θ = π/2, and Rpq <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a single open disk with pq as its diameter.|$|R

5|$|Raurava (fearful or hell of rurus): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it is {{assigned}} {{for a person}} who cares about his own and his family's good, but harms other living beings and is always envious of others. The living beings hurt by such a man <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> savage serpent-like beasts called rurus and torture this person. The Vishnu Purana deems this hell fit for a false witness or one who lies.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} igneous {{rock from the}} Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) intrudes into the {{surrounding}} metamorphic schists; the intrusions <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a series of concentric ring dikes. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of andesite and basaltic lavas.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II {{is one of}} {{the notable}} early {{exceptions}} to the series' common setting, as it is set in a science fiction-styled future despite still including fantasy elements. The Last Bible series also shifted to a full fantasy setting. Two more recent notable departures were Strange Journey, which shifted the focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, which included a medieval-stage society existing separately from a modern-day Tokyo. The Devil Summoner games <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> modern-day detective stories as opposed to post-apocalyptic settings.|$|E

5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. The celebration of the Day of Reconciliation can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.integrifolia is placed in Banksia subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Banksias characteristic flower spikes; Banksia sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and Banksia ser. Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, {{but this was not}} supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E
