5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> Another adaptation <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
2500|$|Sight or vision (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the {{capability}} of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible light on photoreceptors in the retina of each eye that generates electrical nerve impulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. [...] There {{are two types of}} photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors. [...] Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that [...] different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue that stereopsis, the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the visual cortex of the brain where patterns and objects in images are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.|$|E

50|$|The fovea {{is blind}} <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night {{must be viewed}} from the side, so it stimulates the rods.

Stargardt causes progressive vision loss usually {{to the point of}} legal blindness. Several genes are associated with the disorder. Symptoms, mainly central vision loss, typically develop before age 20 (median age of onset: ~17 years old), and also include wavy vision, blind spots, blurriness, impaired color vision, and difficulty adapting <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> (dark adaptation delays).|$|R

50|$|The wavelength, {{intensity}} {{and complexity of}} Light are detected by visual receptors in the retina of the eye. There {{are two types of}} visual receptors: rods and cones.

50|$|The cones {{respond to}} bright light and mediate {{high-resolution}} colour vision during daylight illumination (also called photopic vision). The rods are saturated at daylight levels and don't contribute to pattern vision. However, rods do respond <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> and mediate lower-resolution, monochromatic vision under very {{low levels of}} illumination (called scotopic vision). The illumination in most office settings falls between these two levels and is called mesopic vision. At these light levels, both the rods and cones are actively contributing pattern information to that exiting the eye. What contribution the rod information makes to pattern vision under these circumstances is unclear.|$|E

5000|$|RP {{begins with}} death of rod {{photoreceptor}} cells, {{which are the}} only cells in the retina to express rhodopsin and which express it as their most abundant protein. Eventually, loss of rod cells leads to loss of cone cells (cone photoreceptors), the mainstay of human vision. Symptoms of RP include loss of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> abnormal visual function, and characteristic bone [...] deposits of pigment in the retina. Affected individuals progressively lose visual field and visual acuity, and photoreceptor cell death can ultimately lead to blindness. A prominent early clinical feature of retinitis pigmentosa {{is the loss of}} night vision as a result of death of rod photoreceptor cells. Proper expression of the wild-type rhodopsin gene is essential for the development and sustained function of photoreceptor cells.|$|E

Retinal degeneration slow mice (rds/rds) were tested for responses to light at 3 months, 1 and 2 years old.

50|$|Most {{bees are}} diurnal, active during the day. This species and its closest {{relatives}} are nocturnal, leaving the nest to forage in the evening. Its adaptations <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> {{have been well}} studied. Like other bees, it has apposition compound eyes, an eye type which is effective in bright light. Specialized anatomical differences in the eyes, such as larger facets, make them 27 times more sensitive to light than those of diurnal bees. Cells in the eyes are especially sensitive to the polarization of light that occurs during twilight hours, {{the time when the}} bee is active. The brain also has specialized neurons that help it process low light. In addition, new research has shown that they use more than just light sensitivity to be nocturnal. M. genalis actually uses a neural summation of previous experiences in order to improve the reliability of their vision in dim light. They use this data stored in their brains in order to precisely land and fly long distances in large changes of light.|$|E

This study aimed to determine the acute effects of 3 hours of morning versus evening blue-enriched light exposure compared <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> on hunger, metabolic function, and physiological arousal. Nineteen healthy adults completed this 4 -day inpatient protocol under dim light conditions (< 20 lux). Participants were randomized to 3 hours of blue-enriched light exposure on Day 3 starting either 0. 5 hours after wake (n = 9; morning group) or 10. 5 hours after wake (n = 10; evening group). All participants remained in dim light on Day 2 to serve as their baseline. Subjective hunger and sleepiness scales were collected hourly. Blood was sampled at 30 -minute intervals for 4 hours {{in association with the}} light exposure period for glucose, insulin, cortisol, leptin, and ghrelin. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and area under the curve (AUC) for insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR and cortisol were calculated. Comparisons relative to baseline were done using t-tests and repeated measures ANOVAs. In both the morning and evening groups, insulin total area, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-IR AUC were increased and subjective sleepiness was reduced with blue-enriched light compared <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> The evening group, but not the morning group, had significantly higher glucose peak value during blue-enriched light exposure compared <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> There were no other significant differences between the morning or the evening groups in response to blue-enriched light exposure. Blue-enriched light exposure acutely alters glucose metabolism and sleepiness, however the mechanisms behind this relationship and its impacts on hunger and appetite regulation remain unclear. These results provide further support for a role of environmental light exposure in the regulation of metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Levels of cortisol, {{a hormone}} {{produced}} by the adrenal gland, follow a daily, 24 -hour rhythm with concentrations reaching a minimum {{in the evening and}} a peak near rising time. In addition, cortisol levels exhibit a sharp peak in concentration within the first hour after waking; this is known as the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The present study is a secondary analysis of a larger study investigating the impact of short-wavelength (λmax≈ 470 [*]nm) light on CAR in adolescents who were sleep restricted. The study ran over the course of three overnight sessions, at least one week apart. The experimental sessions differed in terms of the light exposure scenarios experienced during the evening prior to sleeping in the laboratory and during the morning after waking from a 4. 5 -hour sleep opportunity.
