A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women).

25|$|In 1851, 38% {{of the men}} and 27% of {{the women}} were {{employed}} in cotton; the only alternative employment was agriculture, building, or labouring on the railway. Consequently, the town was vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of cotton or the export trade. The American Civil War caused the cotton famine of 1861–64. The mill owners met together and put in place a relief programme through which they supplied food, clogs and coal <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>employees.</b> Howard increased the workforce on his estate, and public works (such as improving the domestic water supply) were undertaken. They provided unsecured loans to the workers until the cotton returned. The relationship between the owners and men was one of paternal benevolence. They lived in the same community and worshipped in the same churches. The mill owners were the local aldermen, the church elders and led the sports teams. In the Luddite and Chartist times and the period following Peterloo, Glossop was virtually unaffected, despite its proximity to Hyde, a radical hotbed. In the '4s 2d or swing strike' it was incomers from Ashton who stopped the Glossop mills. The rivalry in Glossop was not based on class, but on religious groups.|$|E
500|$|In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary {{to chair}} a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to {{replicate}} the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding {{the merits of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>employees</b> through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as [...] "Hillarycare" [...] and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.|$|E

2500|$|According to Dr. Orit Kamir, {{the most}} {{effective}} way to avoid sexual harassment in the work place, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>employees.</b> Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to [...] "air out the dirty laundry" [...] with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.|$|E
