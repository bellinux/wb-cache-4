5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled away from him and the No. 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E

He stayed in the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch his (and his team's) first victory in the GP2 Series. In the second race, Daniël de Jong started from pole position but lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> Matsushita. He then fended off a challenge by de Jong and Oliver Rowland for the position after he made a slow restart. Gasly became the leader when Marciello and Matsushita made contact and held it until Giovinazzi passed him to win the race.|$|E
