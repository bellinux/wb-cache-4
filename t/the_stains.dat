5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when Mary Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers, as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted {{that he would not}} have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E

I disadvantages of most staining methods employed for the demon-X stration of mucin in histological sections of animal tissues are as follows: 1. Doubtful specificity. Not only mucins accept the stain; other elements such as nuclei, connective tissues, &c, may do so as well. 2. Loss of stain. In some cases where mucin is stained in a specific manner by dilution of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> used, by adjustment of the pH of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> solution, or by metachromatic properties of <b>the</b> <b>stain,</b> it is frequently difficult or impossible to dehydrate, clear, and mount the section without either immediate or later loss of <b>the</b> <b>stain.</b> 3. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> mucin may have other stains added to it during additional operations. 4. <b>The</b> <b>staining</b> methods may be involved or may require the making-up of reagents which are often unstable...|$|R

25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

Although forensic experts would deduce later that morning that <b>the</b> <b>stains</b> covered by the black paint had actually been varnish stains, one of the investigators discovered numerous hair clippings—many measuring less than three-eights of an inch—aside the family washing machine. When questioned as {{to the source of}} these clippings, Leik (who had not been informed of the discovery of the hair clippings found upon Beineman's panties) informed investigators that his wife regularly cut their children's hair in this basement, and that she had done so shortly before the family had embarked upon their vacation. Moreover, this search had also uncovered small bloodstains in nine areas of the basement. Two of these bloodstains were discovered to be type A—the blood type of Karen Sue Beineman.|$|E
25|$|Many toothpastes make {{whitening}} claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes <b>the</b> <b>stains.</b> Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate {{to break down}} or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth whitening gels represent an alternative. However, the whitening process can permanently reduce {{the strength of the}} teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.|$|E

The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E
