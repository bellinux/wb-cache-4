50|$|The <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in Australia in 1913 {{in a human}} case report. In 1923, the United States identified it {{as a cause of}} dermatitis in humans. In 1931, it was discovered in Hamburg, Germany, in a seaport.|$|E
50|$|Ornithonyssus bacoti is a hematophagous {{parasite}} {{commonly referred}} to as the <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite.</b> They feed only on blood and serum from many hosts. They can be found and cause disease on rats and wild rodents most commonly, but also small mammals and humans when other hosts are scarce. Outbreaks tend to occur in older, less maintained buildings. The mite, however, can travel several hundred feet on its own if necessary to find a host and can survive for extended periods of time without a host. This, along with the nonspecific dermatitis it causes, can prevent accurate and fast diagnosis of rat mite dermatitis. The scarcity of reports, due in part to misdiagnosis and also the mildness of its symptoms, makes the disease seem less common than it is. The <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> can be found in both temperate and tropical regions or rather all continents except the arctic and Antarctic.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> {{is between}} 0.75 and 1.44 mm {{in length and}} is unsegmented with chelicerae or mandibles which are suited to piercing. They have a sharp caudal apex of the scutum, an oval genital shield, and a cranially {{positioned}} anus. These mites are capable of parthenogenic reproduction. After taking a blood meal, they are static and yellow or dark red in color. However, before a blood meal, they are more active and grey in color.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> bites its host, {{it causes}} an {{inflammatory}} reaction to its saliva and then pruritic nonspecific dermatitis. In children especially, vesicular or eczematous reactions sometimes occur. Secondary excoriations due to scratching are common. Papular urticaria {{has been suggested}} as developing in some people. No human disease has been definitively found to be naturally vectored by this mite. Lab demonstrations have proved that the mite is at least capable of vectoring murine typhus, rickettsialpox, tularemia, plague, coxsackievirus, and Q fever, although {{it has not been}} known to do so outside the lab. The mite was reported as capable of vectoring human typhus, but these reports are not generally accepted.|$|E

40|$|Background : <b>Tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> (Ornithonyssus bacoti) is {{reported}} from {{many parts of}} the world and is considered important in transmitting rickettsial pathogens. There have been scanty reports on prevalence of this parasite from India. Following a recent report of O. bacoti infestation in a laboratory mice colony from Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, In­dia, attempts were made to detect the parasite in its natural reservoir, ie the domestic and peridomestic rats (Rattus rattus). Methods : The National Centre for Disease Control, Coonoor is involved in screening plague in domestic and peridomestic rats in Nilgiris and erstwhile plague endemic areas of Southern India. The parasite samples were identi­fied based on the morphological characteristics attributable to O. bacoti and as per description of published literature. Results: Seven mite samples identified as O. bacoti based on morphological characteristics were isolated inci­dentally from domestic and peridomestic rodents in and around the hilly districts of Nilgiris, Southern India, during the routine plague surveillance programme. The identification was based on the morphological characteristics at­tributable to O. bacoti observed under a low power microscope. Conclusion : In India, this is probably the first record of isolation of O. bacoti from domestic and peridomestic ro­dents. Prevalence of such parasite in domestic and peridomestic rats necessitates further investigation on monitoring and surveillance of rickettsial diseases in the locality, as these parasites are considered to be potential vector of transmitting rickettsial pathogen...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ornithonyssus bacoti, {{known as}} <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> <b>mite,</b> is a blood-feeding ectoparasitic {{arthropod}} {{belonging to the}} family Macronyssidae. At night the parasites search for their hosts and seek dark hiding places during the daytime. O. bacoti primarily infests rodents, {{but it has been}} reported also in other small mammals and in humans if suitable preferential hosts are unavailable {{or in the case of}} close contact with infected animals and environments (Beck W, 2008, Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 6 : 245 – 249). In humans the mite is responsible for dermatologic lesions known as rat mite dermatitis. This study reports O. bacoti infestation in pet Campbell's dwarf hamsters and in the owners. Materials and Methods: In the month of December 2012 a Campbell's dwarf hamster with dermatological problems was presented. The subject, a female about 1 year old, was housed in a hamster cage with two other females of the same age. All subjects had been purchased from the same pet shop, at different times between October and December of 2012. After about two weeks from the introduction of the third hamster, the owners noticed a gradual increase in itching in one of the two hamster previously owned. At the same time, one of the six members of the family, a child of 11 years showed dermatologic symptoms including pruritus, papules and scabs on the trunk, arms and legs. The affected child lived in a room where the hamster cage was housed. After two further weeks, two other members of the family showed the same clinical signs. For mite collection, on the infested pet the Scotch test was performed, while the cage was inspected and mites collected with a needle. Isolated mites were preserved in 80 % ethanol, mounted by using Hoyer's medium application according to conventional techniques, and microscopically observed for species identification. Results: At the scotch test, the hamster was positive for mites. From the bottom of the cage, a large number of mites were collected. Mites were highly variable in size and in color, from reddish to dark brown. All isolated mites were adult females ranging from 937 to 1339 µm in length X 453. 2 - 957. 9 µm in width (mean 1033. 8 µm X 556. 2 µm). On the basis of morophology and chaetotaxy, isolated mites were identified with the species O. bacoti. Conclusion: Hamsters were treated with an acaricide, cage were thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated with an acaricide containing permethrin. The house was also disinfected and a professional exterminator was recommended...|$|E
50|$|Treatment of <b>rat</b> <b>mite</b> {{dermatitis}} is on a symptomatic basis. Generally, an oral antihistimine, {{a topical}} corticosteroid, gamma benzene hexachloride, benzyl benzoate, or croamiton {{is used to}} provide relief. Some patients however require no treatment. To effectively rid the patient of dermatitis thorough eradication of the mite from pets and their environment is crucial. Acarides for the environment might be hydrocyanic acid, chlorophenothane (DDT), chlordane, permethrin, pyriproxyfen, or lindane. To rid pets of the mite, selamectin is generally used {{in the form of}} Revolution, Stronghold or Pfizer. Extermination of rats and other wild rodents which are common hosts is also key. Several weeks are needed to be sure that a proper eradication of these mites is complete because the mites are not only found mostly in the environment of the host instead of on the host itself, but also have been found to survive up to 63 days without a blood meal.|$|R
50|$|Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 {{series of}} tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.

The fleas used in these trials were not infected by any biological agent. The fleas were loaded into two types of munitions and dropped from the air. The E14 bomb and E23 bomb, which could be clustered into the E86 cluster bomb and E77 bomb, respectively. When the cluster bombs reached 2,000 or 1,000 feet (600 or 300 m) the bomblets would drop via parachute, disseminating their vector.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the species composition and infestation parameters for parasitic arthropods associated with Rhombomys opimus. Methods: Ectoparasites of R. opimus were collected from seven endemic district of ZCL in Iran including Shirvan and Sfaraysen in North Khorasan Province, Kalaleh in Golestan Province, Damghan and Shahrood in Semnan Prov-ince, and Badrood and Habibabad in Isfahan Province. The areas of study were mainly desert and plain. Rodents were captured using Sherman life traps during active seasons from May to November 2008. Captured rodents were transported to laboratory and their ectoparasites were picked up using brushing against the fur of the rodents. Ecto-parasites were stored in 70 % ethanol for their preservation and then identified based on morphological characters. Results: Ectoparasites belonged to one flea species of Xenopsylla nuttalli and one mite species of Ornithonussus ba-coti. The flea species with 75. 3 % was more common than the mite.

40|$|Background Genes of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) code for key functions in the adaptive immune response of vertebrates {{and most of them}} show exceptionally high polymorphism. This polymorphism has been associated with the selection by diverse and changing parasite communities. We analysed MHC class IIB diversity, gastrointestinal parasite load and body condition in the wild ranging <b>tropical</b> <b>rat</b> Leopoldamys sabanus (Thomas, 1887) under natural selection conditions in a highly variable rainforest environment in Borneo to explore the mechanisms that maintain these high levels of genetic polymorphism. Results Allelic diversity was determined via SSCP and sequencing, and parasite screening was done through non-invasive faecal egg count. The detected alleles showed expected high levels of polymorphism and balancing selection. Besides a clear advantage for more diverse MHC genotypes in terms of number of alleles, reflected in better body condition and resistance against helminth infection, our data also suggested a positive effect of MHC allele divergence within an individual on these parameters. Conclusion In accordance with the heterozygote advantage hypothesis, this study provides evidence for an advantage of more diverse MHC genotypes. More specifically, the potential negative relation between individual allele divergence and number of parasite species is in line with the 'divergent allele advantage' hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are {{reservoir}} hosts for zoonotic pathogens {{that cause}} significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in humans. Studies evaluating the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in <b>tropical</b> Norway <b>rat</b> populations are rare, and data on co-infection with multiple pathogens are nonexistent. Herein, we describe the prevalence of leptospiral carriage, Seoul virus (SEOV), and Bartonella spp. infection independently, {{in addition to the}} rates of co-infection among urban, slum-dwelling Norway rats in Salvador, Brazil, trapped during the rainy season from June to August of 2010. These data were complemented with previously unpublished Leptospira and SEOV prevalence information collected in 1998. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney impressions was used to identify Leptospira interrogans in 2010, whereas isolation was used in 1998, and western blotting was used to detect SEOV antibodies in 2010, whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used in 1998 : in 2010, Bartonella spp. were isolated from a subsample of rats. The most common pathogen in both years was Leptospira spp. (83 %, n= 142 in 1998, 63 %, n= 84 in 2010). SEOV was detected in 18 % of individuals in both 1998 and 2010 (n= 78 in 1998; n= 73 in 2010), and two species of Bartonella were isolated from 5 of 26 rats (19 %) tested in 2010. The prevalence of all agents increased significantly with rat mass/age. Acquisition of Leptospira spp. occurred at a younger mass/age than SEOV and Bartonella spp. infection, suggesting differences in the transmission dynamics of these pathogens. These data indicate that Norway rats in Salvador serve as reservoir hosts for all three of these zoonotic pathogens and that the high prevalence of leptospiral carriage in Salvador rats poses a high degree of risk to human health...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{three most}} {{invasive}} rat species, black or ship rat Rattus rattus, brown or Norway rats, R. norvegicus and Pacific rat, R. exulans have been incrementally introduced to islands as humans have explored the world’s oceans. They have caused serious deleterious effects through predation and competition, and extinction of many species on tropical islands, {{many of which}} are biodiversity hotspots. All three rat species are found in virtually all habitat types, including mangrove and arid shrub land. Black rats tend to dominate the literature but despite this the population biology of invasive rats, particularly Norway rats, is poorly researched on <b>tropical</b> islands. Pacific <b>rats</b> can often exceed population densities of well over 100  rats ha− 1 and black rats can attain densities of 119  rats ha− 1, which is much higher than recorded on most temperate islands. High densities are possibly due to high recruitment of young although the data to support this are limited. The generally aseasonally warm climate can lead to year-round breeding but can be restricted by either density-dependent effects interacting with resource constraints often due to aridity. Apparent adverse impacts on birds have been well recorded and almost all tropical seabirds and land birds can be affected by rats. On the Pacific islands, black rats have added to declines and extinctions of land birds caused initially by Pacific rats. Rats have likely caused unrecorded extinctions of native species on tropical islands. Further research required on invasive <b>rats</b> on <b>tropical</b> islands includes the drivers of population growth and carrying capacities that result in high densities and how these differ to temperate islands, habitat use of <b>rats</b> in <b>tropical</b> vegetation types and interactions with other tropical species, particularly the reptiles and invertebrates, including crustaceans...|$|R
