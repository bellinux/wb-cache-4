5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something he was to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{demonstrated}} U.S. {{air supremacy}} in the Pacific theater by <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> {{the war and}} the vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack. The battle also exhibited Japan's willingness to sacrifice entire ships, even the pride of its fleet, in desperate kamikaze attacks aimed at slowing the Allied advance on the Japanese home islands.|$|E
5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities. In the West the defeat in Normandy and the Allied advance across Western Europe had significant {{consequences for the}} Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany from British night attacks. The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was {{the inability of the}} Luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units. Equally serious was the threat posed by RAF de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders operating over Germany.|$|E

5|$|In 1983 Solti {{conducted}} for the only time at the Bayreuth Festival. By <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> his career he no longer liked abstract productions of Wagner, or modernistic reinterpretations, such as Patrice Chéreau's 1976 Bayreuth Ring, which he found grew boring on repetition. Together with the director Sir Peter Hall and the designer William Dudley, he presented a Ring cycle that aimed to represent Wagner's intentions. The production was not well received by German critics, who expected radical reinterpretation of the operas. Solti's conducting was praised, but illnesses and last-minute replacements of leading performers affected the standard of singing. He was invited to return to Bayreuth for the following season, but was unwell and withdrew on medical advice before the 1984 festival began.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out. It gave Hugh Dowding AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Fighter Command, the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces. The British, possibly {{through the use of}} Ultra intelligence, recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks on the capital. ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, {{it would not have been}} difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E
5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or {{they would all be}} killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the campaign, Philip's army was running out of food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> his career reduced Hope's dignity, in the view of musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as Sounds from Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E
5|$|The GPK and the GD {{had already}} been {{authorised}} by the Acts of 1846 and 1847 to amalgamate at <b>this</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>In</b> fact the GD was absorbed by the GPK which then {{changed its name to}} the G; the 1847 Act provided for the vesting of the GD in the GPK on the date of the opening throughout of the GD, when that company would be dissolved. From the date of the amalgamation the company would be called the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Shikata {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} Link being able to enter and merge onto walls; this feature would eventually {{become one of the}} title's unique gameplay aspects. Within a day, Mouri had created an initial prototype to demonstrate the feature, and seeing it in action led to an influx of ideas. Link was able to transform from a 3D character to a 2D character by entering walls, and then move smoothly around corners to reach places he previously could not. This ability opened up possibilities for creating new puzzles and using new mechanics. At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the project, they were still considering the new game to be an extension of Zelda games on the Nintendo DS, so the prototype itself used the same viewpoint and design of Link from Spirit Tracks. Around October 2010, the prototype was presented to Miyamoto, who approved of the new concept and was happy for development to begin. However, within two weeks of entering production, core members of the development team were reassigned to work on launch games for Nintendo's Wii U console which was scheduled for release in 2012. With the team disbanded, development of the game ceased.|$|E

5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> his career, Smetana's {{command of}} the Czech {{language}} was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and {{made a point of}} writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper Národní listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, Hutton was {{regularly}} {{opening the}} batting for the Pudsey St Lawrence first {{team in the}} Bradford Cricket League. By close observation of his opening partner, the former Yorkshire county batsman Edgar Oldroyd, Hutton further developed his batting technique, especially in defence. The local press soon identified Hutton as a player of promise, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 not out in the Priestley Cup. Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to Percy Holmes as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> his career, Hutton was also considered a promising leg spin bowler. In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score a run in either of his first two innings, over the season he scored 699 runs {{at an average of}} 69.90. Yorkshire appointed Cyril Turner as Hutton's mentor; Hedley Verity and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.|$|E
5|$|The British cyclists, {{for example}} doubled their medal target on 19 August when Victoria Pendleton won Britain's 12th cycling medal, a {{gold in the}} women's sprint. A further two medals were already {{guaranteed}} at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the men's individual sprint, where gold and silver were soon won by Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny respectively. In all Team GB won seven of the ten gold medals up for grabs at the velodrome. The swimmers also managed to double the targeted number of medals in their sport when David Davies won the team's sixth swimming medal– a silver medal in the men's 10 km open water marathon on 21 August. Despite the men's and women's archery teams having come second and third respectively at the 2007 world championships, British archers were unable to win either of their targeted medals. This led to criticism of the tactics used by head coach Peter Suk {{from members of the}} team.|$|E

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar at <b>this</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus {{it was decided to}} use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
