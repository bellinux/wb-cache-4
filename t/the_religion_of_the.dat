5|$|In his work, Durkheim {{focused on}} totemism, <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{aboriginal}} Australians and Native Americans.

5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, if it was <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic {{by the time the}} Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1998, the NEA {{implemented}} {{a policy to}} limit the burial period of all graves to 15 years, due to a shortage of space in the cemeteries. After being buried for 15 years, graves are exhumed and the remains removed. If <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased permits cremation, the exhumed remains are cremated and stored in government columbaria niches; otherwise, the remains are re-buried in smaller individual plots.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Empire's population.|$|E

5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority. Most slaves came {{originally}} from the midwestern and southwestern {{portions of the}} African coast. For over four centuries this region had {{been the subject of}} Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. <b>The</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E
5|$|Protestantism is {{the largest}} Christian {{religious}} grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention {{is the largest}} individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland, It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics with 40 percent of the total population. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story. However, several {{references}} are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, {{the setting for}} Vagrant Story, shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII. The Kiltia religion, featured in Final Fantasy XII, was <b>the</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of}} the game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place Vagrant Story latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story to be in the same world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{description}} may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. <b>The</b> <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E
