In the 1980 race he started what was {{basically}} a standard car from 58th on the grid, but lasted only 14 laps before retiring with gearbox failure. In 1981, he teamed with 1965 winner Barry Seton in the XJS, and after an improved qualifying effort (19th), they weren't classified as finishers of the crash shortened race having completed only 73 of the 120 laps and being {{caught up in the}} crash {{on the top of the}} mountain. Goss returned with a better prepared effort in 1982, sharing the driving with American IMSA Jaguar sports car race driver / team owner Bob Tullius, who also assisted with <b>technical</b> <b>info</b> for the car and engine. Goss qualified the car 14th with a time of 2:22.3 (almost 5 seconds slower than pole sitter Allan Grice in a V8 Holden Commodore, but some 5.7 seconds faster than he had achieved in 1981), but after a strong, consistent run, once again the big cat failed to finish following suspension failure on lap 119.|$|E

An approach based on the use of analytic Saaty scale functions has been defined and is being investigated. 2) Planned and facilitated technologies prioritization workshops, supported development of systems program algorithms based on the concept of influence diagramming, and assessment of analogies between aircraft and space systems developments. 3) Video interviews held with X- 37 personnel at Dryden. The CD-ROM is being concluded and a near-final review disc is expected soon. 4) CD-ROMS were produced by Engineered Multimedia, Inc. (EMI) under subcontract to SAIC. These two CD-ROM products, "Microgravity" and "New Horizons", were delivered to MSFS technical representatives at a briefing at SAID on January 18, 2001. 5) Presentation brochure, "Aviation/Space Analog Team Interim Report" was provided to Space Propulsion Synergy Team (SPST) members and to NASA personnel. Wrap-up of effort will be a mid-April briefing to both MSFC and the full SPST membership. Support to Phase 2 of CCPD ends 3 / 31 / 01. Phase 3 continuation effort planned with emphasis on <b>technical</b> <b>info</b> content. 6) Recommended that eliminating the B- 52 flights of the X- 37 in favor of alternate approached be evaluated. Discovered that a required change to the thruster valves of the X- 37 had not been made. Repair work continues on the lower fuselage section of the X- 37, in the areas that experienced core collapse. The currently catalogued potential weight increases and decreases are about equal, but this does not include the impact of the cable weight underestimate reported earlier. The CFD for RCS testing correlates well with the wind tunnel data. 7) The Level IV CCB approved SCN- 4 to the MC- 1 Engine SPecification. Approved changes have been incorporated into the specification, and Revision D has been released to the Repository. Billy Gonterman, SAIC, traveled to SSC to perform a five-day readiness assessment on the progress of facilities activation. Implemented modifications to the MC- 1 Engine TPA Component Database. 8) Replaced 25 Combined-Cycle Propulsion Database (CCPD) documents; modified the low-on screen to include a direct email link for user contact; prepared a summary presentation of current and proposed tasks...|$|E
40|$|Language {{documentation}} and description in their many forms (e. g., word lists, dictionaries and grammars, discourse representations, or audio/visual recordings) often for academic purposes of research, {{in and of}} themselves cannot save a language. They do, however, comprise a critical facet of the revitalization enterprise. Challenges come when these sources of information are overly technical and inaccessible to communities working to revitalize the language (Penfield & Tucker 2011; Rice 2011; Hinton 2001) and are perceived as only preservation oriented. This presentation discusses ways in which meeting community needs for teaching can be addressed through documentation designed to be mutually beneficial. Examples come from a revitalization effort focused on tone and vowel length in Cherokee. Understanding the distinctive features of tone and vowel length in the Cherokee language without available resources has been challenging for second language learners whether in the classroom or studying on their own. With no corresponding audio and written examples for the learners, teachers, or researchers to refer to, learners felt limited. Responding to this community need, documentation served to specifically feed into teaching through a close interface between the different foci of documenting and creating educationally helpful tools. The collaborative aspect of the project brought together speakers, second language users, linguists, educational specialists, and others with a vested interest in taking documentation beyond preservation to facilitating teaching. Documentation and acoustic analysis resulted in data about pitch and vowel length including visual representations (AUTHOR submitted). This <b>technical</b> <b>info</b> contributed toward {{a better understanding of the}} nature of Cherokee tone and vowel length. To convert this information to a useful form for language learning, we built on the idea that improving ability to receptively identify tones can generalize to production (Wang et al. 1999). Research indicates that the complexity of and confusion about input associated with tones can be lessened by providing visual pitch contours with written forms accompanying audio materials (e. g., Liu, et al. 2011) and also by presenting tones in pairs (e. g., Wang et al. 1999). The resulting “teachable” component kept linguistics jargon to a minimum and incorporated visual representations in PowerPoint lectures with embedded audio that could be used by teachers plus allow learners to practice on their own. Constant input from teachers and learners helped guide the documentation process so it would result in information valuable to revitalization efforts – thus, teaching needs helped determine the direction the documentation work.
