5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid roots <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{tumors of the}} {{adrenal medulla}} <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> chromaffin cells.

5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E

5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism {{in different parts of the}} world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis is one {{of several}} species of Persoonia that {{regenerate}} by resprouting from the trunk after bushfire, an adaptation to the fire-prone habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying epicormic buds from the flames. Plants also regenerate by seedlings <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> a seedbank in the soil after fire, although they may take up to 12months to germinate. One study of sclerophyll forest unburnt for thirty years showed P.levis had declined over time. P.levis plants can live for over 60years, and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6years.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which {{are driven by}} thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, the {{original}} specimen {{was of the}} black-plumaged subspecies from Dirk Hartog Island, which was not recorded again for 80years. Meanwhile, the widespread blue-plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by John Gould in 1865. He called one specimen collected from inland New South Wales the white-winged superb warbler, M. cyanotus, while another, which appeared to have a white back and wings, was described as M. leuconotus, the white-backed superb warbler. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that both of these blue-plumaged mainland forms were found to be of a single species. George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, considered the specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of the genus, and more recent studies have followed suit. The back region between the shoulders is in fact bare, with feathers <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the shoulder (scapular) region and sweep inwards in different patterns. This variation confused the early naturalists who described the white-backed and blue-backed species.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to}} a growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{birds were}} a food and fuel source for early European settlers, {{and are now}} farmed, in Australia and elsewhere, for their meat, oil and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The {{commercial}} industry {{in the country is}} based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1million birds in the US, Peru, and China, {{and to a lesser extent}} in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18months.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
