25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without <b>toppling</b> <b>over.</b> As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|E
500|$|As waves {{approach}} {{land and}} move into shallow water, they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (refraction) or wrap rocks and headlands (diffraction). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the seabed, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the waves' height, which is called wave shoaling. When {{the ratio of the}} wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it [...] "breaks", <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> in a mass of foaming water. This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.|$|E

2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E
60|$|At length, we drew nigh to a rock, called Pella, or The Theft. A high, green crag, <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> its base, and flinging a {{cavernous}} shadow upon the lagoon beneath, bubbling with the moisture that dropped.|$|E

6000|$|... "Luff, luff a little--steady!" [...] roared the captain, who saw {{the summit}} of the wave <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> the stern, and who fully {{appreciated}} the danger of being [...] "pooped," [...] which means having a wave launched upon the quarterdeck.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought that}} their two companions might {{possibly}} {{have been killed by}} the <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> of the sleigh filled Dave and Roger with fresh horror, and for several minutes neither of the youths spoke.

60|$|Syme had {{the feeling}} he had more than once had in these adventures--the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just <b>toppling</b> <b>over.</b> Walking in a world he half understood, he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this {{remarkable}} nobleman. He pulled it hard, and it came off in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen, and lay in a mixed heap. The next couple, unable to check its progress, came <b>toppling</b> <b>over</b> the obstacle.

60|$|It {{was a time}} {{of extreme}} peril, and it is {{doubtful}} if any one realized that more than did Jack Rover. He, too, had been thrown down, and across his legs was sprawled the heavy form of Fatty Hendry.
