However, in these patients the diagnosis is difficult, especially because the signs and symptoms suggestive of HF-PEF are very common in CKD; in these cases the detection of left ventricular structural and functional alterations (as reported in the 2012 ESC guidelines on heart failure), assumes a decisive role for the diagnosis of HF-PEF.

The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity in the Republic of Srpska and to investigate its association with hyperglycemia and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out during the period from February to October 2012 among 555 pregnant women in gestational period from 24 to 28 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion</b> from <b>the</b> sample was previously diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Results. Before pregnancy, 20. 39 % of participants had increased body mass index, while 4. 04 % [95 % confidence interval (CI); 2. 62 – 6. 13] were obese. Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 10. 91 % (95 % CI, 8. 44 – 13. 98) of them. The increase in body mass index by 1 increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus by 1. 09 times [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 09; 95 % CI; 1. 02 – 1. 16].

40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage (SICH) {{is a form}} of {{cerebrovascular accident}} with a very high rate of morbidity and mortality. The determinants of prognosis include the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic factors. It is long known that the hematoma size has a negative impact on the outcome in SICH. The influence of perihematomal edema (PHE) is not established to the extent same as that of hematoma volume. Hence, we planned this study to determine as to what role does PHE plays in the outcome in SICH. Aim of the Study: To evaluate the prognostic influence of absolute and relative edema (ratio of absolute edema to hematoma volume) in the patients of SICH. Materials and Methods : This is a prospective case-controlled study. A total of 44 patients were enrolled after excluding the confounding factors. The patients were evaluated and their disability was assessed using modified Rankin scale (MRS). The imaging was done in the interval between 24 and 72 h and the hematoma volume, absolute edema volume, and the relative edema were calculated. The outcome was reassessed at 12 weeks and defined as favorable if MRS < 3. Results: A total of 69 patients were found to be having SICH on imaging; however, 25 patients were excluded as they had one of <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Hence, only 44 patients were included in the study. On univariate analysis, none of the demographic characteristics of the patients, vascular risk factors, presenting complaints, blood pressure, Glasgow coma scale, and MRS at admission, laboratory parameters were not significantly different in the two outcome groups. The hematoma volume was significantly higher in the poor outcome group (P < 0. 0001) and the relative edema was associated with a favorable outcome at 12 weeks (P < 0. 0001). On multivariate logistic regression, the hematoma volume and relative edema were found to have effect on the outcome similar to that seen on univariate analysis. Conclusion: In SICH, a larger hematoma volume is a predictor of poor outcome and a relative edema is associated with a better functional status...|$|R

A total of 900 patients were entered into the final database. We explored the association of serum CRP just before the first HD session with clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and medications for CKD in the predialysis period. Results On univariate analysis, age, CTR, eGFR, and WBC were significantly correlated with CRP. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin, LDL-C, HDL-C, Hb, Cr, and Ca were inversely associated with CRP. Use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA) using (r[*]=[*]− 0. 111, p[*]=[*] 0. 0015), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (r[*]=[*]− 0. 083, p[*]=[*] 0. 0154), and calcium channel blockers (r[*]=[*]− 0. 1, p[*]=[*] 0. 0039) was also negatively correlated with CRP.

40|$|Background: S. aureus {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of infections in {{hospitals}} and community. Individuals aged < 20 years has the percentage of carriage of S. aureus greater than those in adults. Treatment of infections by S. aureus becomes more complex in relation to the emergence of resistant S. aureus against various antibiotics. This study aimed to determine the prevalence difference of carriage of S. aureus and antibiotic resistance patterns on three elementary schools. Methods: The study design was an observational and cross-sectional survey approach. Subjects were 3 - 5 grade elementary school students who meet <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> on three elementary schools. Samples were interviewed and taken a nasal swab. Nasal swab results were identified the germ tipe and antibiotic resistance testing (MDRO and MRSA) using disk diffusion method.

Methods: An observational analytic study with a cross-sectional sampling of the 46 wrestlers who met <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> in Klub Gulat Garuda. Data retrieved by performing a nasal swab and filling a questionnaire to get a variable risk factor. Identification of S. aureus colonies was identified {{through a series of}} studies in microbiology laboratory. Data was analyzed by Chisquare/Fisher-exact then performed logistic regression in SPSS 15. 0 for windows. Result: Positive S. aureus colonization was found in 15 samples. Prevalence of S. aureus colonization in wrestlers in this study was 32, 61...|$|R
