5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt <b>to</b> <b>inactivate</b> the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough <b>to</b> <b>inactivate</b> 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

The inactivated bovine viral diarrhea virus alone was demonstrated to be a weak immunogen. Addition of either 2 mg per mL diethylaminoethyl-dextran or 5 % alhydrogel <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> bovine viral diarrhea virus did not or only slightly stimulated the antibody response; the combined adjuvants induced {{a significantly higher}} titer. A higher concentration (20 mg per mL) of diethylaminoethyl-dextran, on the contrary, suppressed the immune potentiation by the dual adjuvants. Combination of Bordetella bronchiseptica and alhydrogel adjuvants stimulated a high titer of antibody. The titer was further elevated upon revaccination and {{was significantly higher than}} that induced by alhydrogel alone. In cattle, alhydrogel enhanced the immune response and the additional inclusion of diethylaminoethyl-dextran did not cause a significant potentiation of the immunity.

40|$|Immunosuppression {{resulting}} from {{infectious bursal disease}} virus (IBDV) infection has critical health and welfare implications for birds, yet it is incompletely understood and largely overlooked {{as a measure of}} vaccine efficacy. The ability of a fowlpoxvirus recombinant (fpIBD 1) containing the VP 2 protein of IBDV to protect against IBDV-induced immunosuppression was investigated by measuring the convalescent chicken's ability to mount antibody responses to IBDV infection, and <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> IBDV and salmonella vaccines. An immunoglobulin (Ig) M response, but no IgG response, occurred after IBDV infection. Uninfected chickens produced a sustained IgM response and some IgG response <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> IBDV vaccine, while in previously infected birds only a transient IgM response was detected. A moderate suppression of the response to a commercial salmonella vaccine was evident after IBDV infection, which was largely prevented by immunization with fpIBDl. These results indicate that measurement of immunosuppression could be a useful strategy for assessing the efficacy of vaccines to protect against the consequences of IBDV infection...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether exposure <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) can produce an antigenic response in rabbits and {{protect them from}} a subsequent challenge with virulent virus. The aim {{was to determine if}} the spreading of baits containing RHDV, which is a common management practice in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, could result in protective immunity in wild rabbits. RHDV was inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) light using an electronic UV crosslinker with a UV dose of 168. 48 W-s/cm 2 and a UV intensity of 0. 0078 W/cm 2. Two groups of four rabbits were then inoculated with inactivated virus via oral and intramuscular routes. Rabbits were monitored for 30 days post-inoculation and then challenged orally with virulent virus. No rabbit exposed <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> RHDV developed clinical signs of RHD or had antibodies at day 30 post-infection and all animals died within 82 h after challenge with virulent virus. No antibodies were detected at the time of death. These findings suggest that exposure <b>to</b> virus completely <b>inactivated</b> by UV light in the field or on baits will not protect rabbits against challenge with virulent virus...|$|R

25|$|Two main {{strategies}} have been employed to identify essential genes on a genome-wide basis: directed deletion of genes and random mutagenesis using transposons.

In transposon-mediated mutagenesis transposons are randomly inserted in as many positions in a genome as possible, aiming <b>to</b> <b>inactivate</b> the targeted genes (see figure below).

25|$|Other {{numerical}} abnormalities discovered include {{sex chromosome}} abnormalities.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} acyclovir (ACV) therapy on the cellular immune response, we sequentially followed 43 patients with culture-proven first episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Twenty-three patients who were treated with ACV and 20 who received placebo had blood obtained weekly during the first 6 weeks after onset of lesions and had their in vitro lymphocyte transformation (LT) response <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> HSV antigens measured. The mean stimulation index to HSV antigens at week 3 among patients treated with systemic ACV was 3. 5 +/- 0. 64 compared to 18. 4 +/- 6. 89 in their placebo-treated counterparts (P less than 0. 05). The mean time {{to the development of}} the peak LT response to HSV antigens was 4. 3 weeks in systemic-treated versus 3. 4 in placebo-treated patients (P less than 0. 05). The time {{to the development of the}} peak in vitro LT response to HSV antigens and the height of that response were, however, similar between topical ACV- and topical placebo-treated patients. The geometric mean HSV- 2 -neutralizing titer in convalescent sera was 5. 4 in recipients of systemic ACV compared to 10. 0 in patients treated with systemic placebo (P less than 0. 05). The LT response to HSV antigen was also measured at the first recurrence in 11 patients. No differences were found in the time to first recurrence, lesion duration, number of lesions, or mean stimulation index response <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> HSV antigens between the six patients treated with systemic ACV during their primary episode and the five given placebo during their primary episode. Systemic ACV therapy appears to diminish the peak in vitro LT response <b>to</b> <b>inactivated</b> HSV antigens as well as to delay the time to development of that peak response.

However, cytotoxicity owards uninfected cells fell to near background levels by day 7, whilst cytotoxicity towards infected targets remained high at that time, when IFN-~ production was at its peak. IFN-v production is therefore temporally associated with cytotoxicity specifically directed against virus-infected targets, and the ability to produce IFN-v is a late response to SFV infection...|$|R

As DDA could be administered to animals at a site different from the measles virus antigens, or 1 day previously, and still significantly enhance the DTH response, DDA is probably acting more as an immune modulator than as a simple adjuvant.
