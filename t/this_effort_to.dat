5|$|Edward VI became {{seriously ill}} from {{tuberculosis}} and the councillors {{were told that}} he did not have long to live. In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving. Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the Regius Chair in Cambridge which was vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses. Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer. Despite his plea, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England. While <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to convince several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward's cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's daughter and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act. Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors. Edward told him that he supported what he wrote in his will. Cranmer's decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Government and {{military}} commands were, however, {{well aware that}} even with <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the garrison of Goa, the Portuguese forces would never be sufficient to face a conventional attack from the Indian Armed Forces, which could easily concentrate against that territory land forces overwhelmingly stronger than the Portuguese ones, as well as air and naval forces.

25|$|During the Kirtland era, many charismatic {{experiences}} were reported, many involving visitations of angels or communication from God through stones. However, some Church members claimed to receive revelations that contradicted those received by Joseph Smith. He and several followers prayed about the issue, and Joseph recorded {{a series of}} revelations, which included a description of several real spiritual gifts, a statement that only Joseph Smith, as the Prophet, could receive new doctrines and commandments for the Church, and a warning that not all supernatural experiences come from God. <b>This</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> balance charismatic experience with order and stability became a lasting characteristic of the Latter Day Saint Movement.|$|E

25|$|Cochran {{was elected}} to the New Castle County Levy Court in 1838 and 1846. In 1874 he was elected Governor of Delaware by {{defeating}} Isaac Jump, the Republican candidate and served from January 19, 1875 until January 21, 1879. He was the first governor from New Castle County in thirty years, and was regarded as a progressive governor, advocating improvements to the school law, and reapportionment of the General Assembly, to more fairly reflect the population of New Castle County. The reapportionment proposal was not approved. The General Assembly did, however, pass legislation requiring businesses serving the public “to provide equal accommodations for those who might be deemed obnoxious by others.” <b>This</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> deny civil rights to African-Americans was to remain on the books until 1963.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the quality}} of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E
500|$|Rosenblat {{was given}} the storyline that ties up the second season. The scenes feature Miss Rosa being told that {{she is going to}} die from her cancer. Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> get rid of this woman, just evil incarnate, you know, and then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' Amazing. That final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E
500|$|The British used {{smallpox}} as {{a biological}} warfare agent at the Siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) against France and its Native American allies. The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted {{the use of}} smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and [...] "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox". [...] On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, [...] "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect." [...] The effectiveness of <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> broadcast the disease is unknown.

500|$|Following Nasser's {{death in}} 1970, Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar {{as a symbol}} of Egyptian {{leadership}} throughout the Arab world, saying that [...] "the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar." [...] Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions. As part of <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ulema of al-Azhar continued {{to be used as a}} tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including Islamist and other more moderate groups. Shukri Mustafa, an influential Islamist figure, accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience. When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel, which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the nobility}} and gentry were leaving {{town for the}} summer, but Leopold {{reckoned}} that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> support charitable works as [...] "a way to earn the love of this very special nation". Wolfgang was advertised as [...] "the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age..." [...] (he was in fact eight), [...] "justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. [...] "Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, {{and for the sake}} of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|When word {{reached the}} airlift commander, Lieutenant General William H. Tunner, he ordered it {{expanded}} into Operation [...] "Little Vittles," [...] {{a play on}} the airlift's name of Operation Vittles. Operation Little Vittles began officially on September 22, 1948. Support for <b>this</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> provide the children of Berlin with chocolate and gum grew quickly, first among Halvorsen's friends, then to the whole squadron. As news of Operation Little Vittles reached the United States, children and candymakers {{from all over the}} US began contributing candy. By November 1948, Halvorsen could no longer keep up with the amount of candy and handkerchiefs being sent from across America. College student Mary C. Connors of Chicopee, Massachusetts offered to take charge of the now national project and worked with the National Confectioner's Association to prepare the candy and tie the handkerchiefs. With the groundswell of support, Little Vittles pilots, of which Halvorsen was now one of many, were dropping candy every other day. Children all over Berlin had sweets, and more and more artwork was getting sent back with kind letters attached to them. The American candy bombers became known as the Rosinenbomber (Raisin Bombers), while Halvorsen himself became known by many nicknames to the children of Berlin, including his original moniker of [...] "Uncle Wiggly Wings," [...] as well as [...] "The Chocolate Uncle", [...] "The Gum Drop Kid" [...] and [...] "The Chocolate Flier." ...|$|E
