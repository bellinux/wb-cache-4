John Searle's view, defended with passion in this book, is highly idiosyncratic: what is special about consciousness is its "subjective ontology," but normal science can accommodate subjective ontology alongside (not within) its otherwise objective ontology. Once we clear away some widespread confusions about what science requires, and dismiss the misbegotten field of cognitive science that has been engendered by <b>those</b> <b>confusions,</b> the subjective ontology of the mind, he claims, will lose its aura of unacceptable mystery...|$|R

The confusions are detected at the pronunciation and the confusions matrices of the phoneme recognizer. The confusions show that some similarities between phonemes at the pronunciation affect significantly the recognition rates. This paper proposes to understand <b>those</b> <b>confusions</b> {{in order to improve}} the performance of the phoneme recognition system by isolating the problematic phonemes. Confusion analysis leads to build a new hierarchical recognizer using new phoneme distribution and the information from the confusion matrices.

40|$|The term {{participatory}} {{research is}} now widely {{used as a}} way of categorising research that has moved beyond researching "on" to researching "with" participants. This paper draws attention to some confusions that lie behind such categorisation and the potential impact of <b>those</b> <b>confusions</b> on qualitative participatory research in practice. It illuminates some of the negative effects of "fitting in" to spaces devised by other types of research and highlights the importance of forging spaces for presenting participatory research designs that suit a discursive approach and that allow the quality and impact of such research to be recognised. The main contention is that the adoption of a variety of approaches and purposes is part of the strength of participatory research but that to date the paradigm has not been sufficiently articulated. Clarifying the unifying features of the participatory paradigm and shaping appropriate ways for critique could support the embedding of participatory research into research environments, funding schemes and administration in a way that better reflects the nature and purpose of authentic involvement.

Their conclusion is that people’s puzzlement cannot be dismissed as a product of confusion, for it stems from some fundamental aspects of their conception of the self. In this paper I suggest, contrary to their conclusion, that there is a sense in which the skeptical worries about responsibility elicited by the computer model of the mind do result from <b>confusion.</b> <b>Those</b> worries can be traced back to an irrational over-generalization concerning the scope of cognitive science and the alleged exhaustiveness of the range of facts formulated in its vocabulary. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{misinformation}} {{effect is}} elicited by presenting misleading post-event misinformation then testing for {{memory of the}} event. Source confusion is hypothesized to underlie the effect. A framework that combines common explanations for the misinformation by Blank (1998) centers individual assumptions of consistency in information as a link to detecting discrepancies in conflicting information sources. The ability to detect discrepancies between sources can contribute to susceptibility to misinformation. Personality scales or individual difference measures {{used to evaluate the}} individual factors show mixed results in prior research. This study used individual difference tests to assess tendency to assume consistency, ability to detect discrepancies, and tendency toward source confusion. The individual difference measures were: Need for Closure Scale, Interpersonal Trust Scale, Mental Rotations Test, Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, the Deese-Roediger-McDermott procedure, the Wechsler Symbol Search, and the newly-created Detecting Detail Discrepancies test. Participants viewed 5 films and completed memory questionnaires about the films. Two-thirds of the group received misinformation and the remaining third received consistent information. Half the misinformed group was warned about misinformation. Participants 2 ̆ 7 memories for the film events were assessed in recognition and recall formats. Exit interviews asked about consistency assumptions, detection of discrepancies, and experience of source confusion. The results showed the expected robust misinformation effect in recognition and recall testing. The early warning did not reduce the effect in recognition tests, and appeared to enhance the effect in recall tests. Warned participants reported more source <b>confusion.</b> <b>Those</b> who reported detecting discrepancies also reported source <b>confusion.</b> <b>Those</b> designated as habitually susceptible from high misinformation recognition scores were not more likely to recall misinformation, but did have lower MRT scores.

Der Begriff partizipative Forschung wird mittlerweile häufig zur Kategorisierung eines Typus von Untersuchungen gebraucht, der sich weg von Forschung "über" Menschen hin zur Forschung "mit" Menschen entwickelt hat. Der Artikel beschäftigt sich mit einigen Unklarheiten eines partizipativen Untersuchungsansatzes und mit deren möglichen Einflüssen auf die konkrete Forschungspraxis. Im Mittelpunkt stehen Probleme, die daraus erwachsen, dass partizipative Forschung an die Anforderungen in akademischen Räumen angepasst werden muss, die dieser Methodik aber nur wenig Anerkennung gewähren. Es wird gezeigt, wie wichtig es ist, eigene Forschungsräume zu kreieren, um partizipative Methodendesigns zu realisieren, die einem diskursiven Ansatz entsprechen. Erst dadurch wird es möglich, die Qualität und die Resultate dieser Methoden schätzen zu lernen. Das Hauptargument ist, dass eine besondere Stärke partizipativer Forschung darin besteht, eine ganze Vielfalt an sozialwissenschaftlichen Forschungsansätzen und  zwecken aufzugreifen. Eine Klärung der gemeinsamen Kennzeichen des partizipativen Paradigmas und die Entwicklung geeigneter Kritikformen könnten einen Beitrag dafür liefern, dass partizipative Forschung stärker in der Sozialforschung, der Forschungsförderung und der öffentlichen Verwaltung aufgegriffen wird.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a clinical research study of therapeutic observation {{of an infant}} in foster care. Infants and children under five represent {{more than half of}} all children entering care in the UK. The emotional needs of this population tend to be overlooked. This study aimed to find out about the experience of an infant or young child in care, to learn about possible reasons for the under-detection of mental health and emotional difficulties in a group of particularly vulnerable children, and to inform training and support for professionals. Therapeutic observation has been reported to be a cost-effective, home-based component in multidisciplinary treatments for infants and young children with a range of difficulties. The study found that the model was acceptable to foster carers and provided a child-centred perspective to the professional network. Grounded theory analysis of the observational data produced a description of dynamics around the infant in foster care, varying from experiences of emotional connectedness and containment (Matrix) to <b>those</b> of <b>confusion,</b> pressure and fragmentation (Tornado), dissociation (Machine), and drift or provisionality (Limbo). Observational data suggested that when ‘Tornado’, ‘Machine’ and Limbo dominate, organisation is driven by trauma rather than by development. This increases the risk of losing contact with the emotional reality of children's experiences. Dilemmas are also explored in relation to the transition from foster care to adoption. The study highlights the role of specialist training to support emotionally responsive caregiving for infants and young children in care. Further research is suggested to investigate the application of this model with infants and young children in a range of care contexts...|$|R

The potential effect of restraint reduction on length of hospital stay (LOS) has not been investigated. This study was undertaken to compare the average length of stay of older patients in a convalescent medical ward setting before and after a restraint reduction program. Design: This is a retrospective study. Setting: A convalescent hospital in Hong Kong. Participants: This study included 2000 patient episodes. Measurements: The use of physical restraint, LOS, and clinical outcomes of randomly selected patient episodes in the year before and after the implementation of a restraint reduction program were compared. The clinical outcomes included Modified Functional Ambulatory Categories and modified Barthel index. Subgroup analysis was performed on <b>those</b> with <b>confusion</b> as defined by dementia diagnosis, low abbreviated mental test score, or abnormal mental domain of Norton Score. Results: A total of 958 and 988 patient episodes admitted to 10 medical wards in a convalescent hospital in 2007 and 2009 were examined.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to explain the stages of lesbian identity development process experienced by Holland Jaeger and the consequences she has to deal as a lesbian. The researcher uses lesbian feminism and some supporting theories to answer the formulated research questions. The method used in this research is qualitative content analysis. The subject {{of this research is}} a novel entitled Keeping You a Secret by Julie Anne Peters. The data were some phrases, clauses, and sentences related to Holland’s lesbian identity development and the consequences she has to deal as a lesbian. The key instrument of this research is the researcher herself employing the lesbian identity formation theory by Vivienne C. Cass and the consequences indicators as explained in the analytical construct. Lesbian feminism theory, which focuses on lesbians’ sexuality, identity and community, is used as the grand theory for the analyses. The indicators made are based on the employed theory to gain the research data. To gain the trustworthiness, the researcher used data triangulation technique by crosschecking the data with her consultants and other researchers. The findings of the research show the process of becoming a lesbian experienced by Holland by examining the stages of lesbian identity development and the consequences which follow it. It covers the six stages of lesbian identity development process; <b>those</b> are <b>confusion</b> stage, comparison stage, tolerance stage, acceptance stage, pride stage and synthesis stage. The analysis of confusion and comparison stages is significant in presenting the dilemma experienced by Holland in becoming a lesbian. The other stages show the problematic situation Holland faces in dealing with the society. The consequences of becoming a lesbian cover the experiences of being the target of homophobic reactions, being rejected, being discriminated, being the victim of violence and being alienated. Those consequences signify the rejection of the society of her becoming a lesbian due to the patriarchal system in the society. The analysis of those difficult situations Holland faces in becoming a lesbian provide useful information for people in dealing with the lesbian phenomenon on the society...|$|R

In fact, risk neutral pricing makes no such assumption of risk neutrality. It simply uses the assumption of no arbitrage rather than risk aversion to drive the pricing process. The point is most easily made in the binomial pricing framework. Consider an asset currently priced at S whose price one period later can be Su with probability q or Sd with probability 1 -q. The factors u and d represent one plus the percentage change in the asset price. How would that asset be priced in a world of risk averse investors? Under risk aversion any risky asset is priced as the discounted value of its future expectation. The expected future price of the asset is qSu + (1 -q) Sd. Consequently, the current price would be given as k+ 1 q) Sd- (1 +qSu = S where k is the risky discount factor, which will consist of the risk free rate, r, plus a risk premium.

40|$|Visual {{categorization}} is {{the brain}} computation that reduces high-dimensional {{information in the}} visual environment into a smaller set of meaningful categories. An important problem in visual neuroscience is to identify the visual information that the brain must represent and then use to categorize visual inputs. Here we introduce a new mathematical formalism—termed space-by-time manifold decomposition—that describes this information as a low-dimensional manifold separable in space and time. We use this decomposition to characterize the representations used by observers to categorize the six classic facial expressions of emotion (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sad). By means of a Generative Face Grammar, we presented random dynamic facial movements on each experimental trial and used subjective human perception to identify the facial movements that correlate with each emotion category. When the random movements projected onto the categorization manifold region corresponding {{to one of the}} emotion categories, observers categorized the stimulus accordingly; otherwise they selected “other. ” Using this information, we determined both the Action Unit and temporal components whose linear combinations lead to reliable categorization of each emotion. In a validation experiment, we confirmed the psychological validity of the resulting space-by-time manifold representation. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of temporal sequencing for accurate emotion categorization and identified the temporal dynamics of Action Unit components that cause typical confusions between specific emotions (e. g., fear and surprise) as well as <b>those</b> resolving these <b>confusions...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Stoves, {{a company}} {{committed}} to UK manufacture with 100% of its built-in ovens, hobs, freestanding and range cookers assembled at its Merseyside headquarters, believed that some brands were trading off their British heritage, despite now being manufactured overseas. In January 2011, it commissioned independent market research among 1,000 British adults. The {{results showed that}} half (48%) of <b>those</b> surveyed admitted <b>confusion</b> about which brands could still claim {{to be made in}} Britain, with international takeovers and moves towards Far Eastern production all contributing to an increasingly puzzled landscape. Two-thirds (67%) wanted an official seal of approval to show products made in Britain, while half (52%) thought British brands should bring manufacturing back to the UK. More than a third (37%) of those questioned stated they would buy British if it was easier to identify authentic made in Britain products. A separate poll by Which? in July 2011 asked [...] "Would a Made in Britain logo help you buy British?" [...] 84% (907 Votes) said ‘Yes it would’; 9% (92 Votes) said ‘No it wouldn't’; and 7% (78 Votes) said ‘I don't care about buying British’ The Stoves research showed that more than half (55%) said that supporting UK manufacturing and jobs is their main incentive to buy British and one third (36%) claim to buy British whenever they can.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} the usability and learnability of Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) within the academic aerospace engineering field. In addition, this paper provides suggestions on how Vehicle Sketch Pad should develop to better provide a desirable graphical user interface (GUI). Aerospace Engineering graduate students were asked to perform specific tasks within Vehicle Sketch Pad, and their performance, efficiency, and workload while completing these tasks were measured. The same students were asked to perform similar tasks within a more traditional computer aided design (CAD) tool, AutoDesk Inventor. At this time, how the user interfaced with the Inventor GUI and what features within the interface they liked and did not like were measured. Analysis of the results of this experiment showed that all three experience-based noise variables, undergraduate major, prior courses taken, and prior VSP experience, do impact the user’s performance, efficiency, and workload while completing a task in VSP. For example, those with a more in-depth Aerospace-related background perceived less workload than those with alternative backgrounds. Additionally, the VSP GUI proved to have a statistically significant impact on the user’s performance, efficiency, and workload. For example, <b>those</b> who experienced <b>confusion</b> due to the workspace layout expressed they felt utilizing VSP was a very mentally demanding task. As a result this analysis, a roadmap for VSP development opportunities was created. This roadmap included users’ opinions and the researcher’s observances of gaps within the VSP GUI in addition to suggestions based on the Inventor GUI...|$|R
6000|$|Berenger {{looked at}} Philip; saw how faded and wan was the ruddy sun-burnt complexion, how lank and bony the sturdy form, how {{listless}} and wasted the hands. Then arose, bursting within him, the devoted generosity of the French nature, which would even accept sin and ruin for self, that so the friend may be saved; and after all, {{had he not}} gone to mass out of mere curiosity?--did he not {{believe that there was}} salvation in the Gallican Church? Was it not possible that, with Philip free to tell his story at home, his own deliverance might come before he should be irrevocably committed to Madame de Selinville? If Eustacie were living, her claims must overthrow that which her rival was forcing upon him at her own peril. Nay, how else could he obtain tidings of her? And for those at home, did they deserve that he should sacrifice all, Philip included, for their sake? The thoughts, long floating round his brain, now surged upon him in one flood, and seemed to overwhelm in <b>those</b> moments of <b>confusion</b> all his powers of calling up {{the other side of the}} argument; he only had an instinct remaining that it would be a lie to God and man alike. 'God help me!' he sighed to himself; and there was sufficient consideration and perplexity expressed in his countenance to cause the Chevalier to feel his cause almost gained; and rising eagerly, with tears in his eyes, he exclaimed, 'Embrace me, my dear, dear son! The thing is done! Oh! what peace, what joy!' ...|$|R
