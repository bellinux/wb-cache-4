The stela's creation and prominent location emphasizes the great importance which Horemheb placed upon domestic reform.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his.</b> The fierce Christological disputes of the period saw the Monophysites, who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced {{the use of the}} empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as Ravenna, where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the Nestorians, another heretical force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{saw little}} action during the {{remainder}} of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bed in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were huddled in a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters. The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.|$|E

French naturalist Jean Ruel made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise De Natura Stirpium, referring to it as capucos coles ("head-coles"), [...] Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet, did not disdain to have a cabbage at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monument in Wimborne St Giles.|$|E
500|$|While playing {{shows in}} England in 1969, the band {{discovered}} {{they were being}} mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema {{across the street from}} the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was [...] "strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies." [...] Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called [...] "Black Sabbath", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as [...] "the Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track [...] "probably the most evil song ever written". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.|$|E

500|$|Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who {{had studied}} at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An {{active member of the}} group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he {{exhibited}} in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison. Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting [...] (1890). The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards the light at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall. Among the works he painted in Skagen are [...] (1884) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers, and the much brighter [...] (1885) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there will be something for the evening meal. After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903. In 1906, he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914.|$|E

[...] The hospital he chose was not one of Houston's noted medical centers, but a new hospital in Houston's suburbs, Sharpstown General Hospital, which was a forty-five-minute drive from the Hill home.
