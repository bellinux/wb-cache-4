5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing {{to have sex with}} him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E

25|$|Many White Christians in the 18th century did not {{consider}} African Americans fully human and {{did not believe that}} they had souls. When this view changed, White Christians began to try to convert slaves to Christianity, although slave owners resisted this conversion because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of slaves revolting. In trying to convert slaves to Christianity, Christian leaders reinforced and approved slavery as well as any means of punishment for slaves who revolted. Some Christian leaders even claimed that slavery was a good thing in that it allowed, or oftentimes forced, slaves to become Christians.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} main Confederate army was marching through Pennsylvania, Lincoln {{was unable to}} give Meade more firepower. The vast {{majority}} of the 700,000 Federal soldiers (except for Grant's 70,000 near Vicksburg) were noncombatants, held static defensive posts that Lincoln feared to uncover, or like Rosecrans at Nashville, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> to move. Urgently the President called for 100,000 civilian militiamen to turn out for the emergency; being unorganized, untrained, unequipped and poorly led, they were more trouble than they were worth.

Neither <b>is</b> it that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of not going to heaven. Their expectation almost always <b>is,</b> that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going thither. But they do not care much to go to heaven. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> willing enough to go there, because they know that they must go somewhere. But their notions of what heaven will be like are by no means clear.

25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate.

The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic {{enough to deal with}} the problems on the estate.

Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as they call it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of the Luhya.|$|E

They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of what their callers would say.

With the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them. Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects. Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July 1824, {{the largest}} fleet {{seen in the}} Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, {{consisting}} of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons. Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus. However, the success of Muhammad Ali's troops in both places settled the Turks on the horns of a very difficult dilemma, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of their wāli's expansionist ambitions.

He was subsequently reassigned to be a tongshi lang (通事郎; a communications secretary) of the Palace Writers (中書). In 249, Cao Shuang was executed after losing power in a coup launched by his co-regent, Sima Yi.

25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of the lifeboat buckling under the weight, others suggested {{it was because the}} crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and children first. Additionally, doors and hatches were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E

Furthermore, 36% of the students said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> or scared and 29% reported feeling confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance.

25|$|The battle went on {{for some}} time with no clear victor, but the Syracusans {{eventually}} pushed the Athenian ships toward the coast, and the Athenian crews fled to the camp behind their wall.

The men themselves did not want to board the ship because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid.</b> They then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no way off the island.|$|E
