5|$|For most of {{its history}} the National Register has been {{administered}} by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, coordinate, identify, and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> not guaranteed. During the nomination process, <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> evaluated {{in terms of the}} four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria {{has been the subject of}} criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians.|$|E

5|$|The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally {{significant}} {{as an example}} of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's distinguishing feature is the corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>property</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} by Donald Norman McLeod in the 1872 {{who returned to}} Victoria in 1882 and purchased Yannarie Estate near Portland and later returned to Western Australia acquiring Minilya Station.

50|$|Receiving stolen {{property}} {{and possession of}} stolen <b>property</b> <b>are</b> treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen. If <b>the</b> person knew that <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen at <b>the</b> time he received it, the crime <b>is</b> receiving stolen <b>property.</b> If <b>the</b> person did not know <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>was</b> stolen at <b>the</b> time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of {{stolen property}}.|$|R
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. <b>The</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. <b>The</b> <b>property</b> <b>is</b> given to the trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to {{pass it on to}} the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
