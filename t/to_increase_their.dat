5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants may be able <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E

Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am.

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers.

This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> own construction.
