Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E

She called the first kiss between the couple the [...] "TV disappointment of the year" [...] and she nicknamed the soap Homo Go Away because the scene in which the kiss featured were diluted to suit certain viewers. Of the decline in ratings during the storyline, Deveny said [...] "Since the lesbian plotline began <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> 100,000 people have turned off. Wow! Turned off. That must {{be the first time}} the words 'lesbian' and 'turn off' have occurred in the same sentence. And all we'd seen until Tuesday was lingering touches and intense stares." [...] Deveny then explained that she would rather let her children watch lesbians on television than Christians. She highlighted that only mothers complained to the network about their children being exposed to a same-sex relationship during a family show, not fathers.|$|E

[...] Canning stated that [...] "the best part of this episode by far was Tracy's paranoia over The Black Crusaders" [...] and he rated the episode 9.7 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote regarding Emily Mortimer's guest appearance that [...] "she's not the first thought for most sitcoms looking to fill a vacancy. But here, she's obviously relishing (as Isabella Rossellini did) {{the chance to go}} a bit bonkers. When she lapsed out of the accent, what fun." [...] Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad wrote that she [...] "didn't find 'Cleveland' nearly as funny as the super-sized 'Fireworks' episode <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> but it was still pretty good. The best sources of humor in this show are Kenneth the Page and Tracy Jordan, neither of which had a very prominent role this week." ...|$|E

In a review from TV Fanatic, writer Christine Orlando stated that the episode [...] "had me {{on the edge of my}} seat and enjoying the ride," [...] giving particular praise to Snow and Charming's chemistry-filled early relationship. Orlando concluded, [...] "Snow White, the character I had the least interest in <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> held her own and then some.
