5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees <b>to,</b> <b>despite</b> not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
5|$|He was an Australian {{selector}} from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68. The Queensland Cricket Association {{wrote to the}} board, complaining that Harvey, who was the selector on duty at the Test, had missed two hours of play. He had been at a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> this, he retained his position at the next annual election, with Queensland's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August {{the three}} Allied commanders– Marlborough, Baden and Eugene– met to decide their strategy. To give {{themselves}} another major crossing over the Danube a plan by Baden to besiege {{the city of}} Ingolstadt with a force of 15,000 men was agreed <b>to,</b> <b>despite</b> leaving the Allied army numerically inferior. This army, totalling 52,000 men and now without the commander who led the Imperial troops on the Schellenberg, would meet the Franco-Bavarian forces, numbering 56,000 men, {{in and around the}} small village of Blindheim. The engagement, fought on 13 August 1704, would become known in German as the Battle of Höchstädt, and in English, as the Battle of Blenheim.|$|E

5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David <b>to,</b> <b>despite</b> learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E

The day Duryodhana was born, he unleashed a donkey-like scream which the donkeys outside the home replied <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> the advice from Vidura to discard the evil baby, Duryodhana's father Dhritarashtra kept the child because demons had received a boon from Shiva that the future king would be invincible.|$|E

25|$|John Anderson {{had been}} an MP since 1988 {{and leader of the}} National Party and Deputy Prime Minister since 1999. Although talented and personable, he was unable to stem the {{long-term}} decline in the Nationals' rural electoral base. During 2003 he considered retiring from Parliament at this election, but was persuaded not <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> his personal standing, the Nationals lost another seat (Richmond) and struggled to win a Senate spot in Queensland. Anderson stepped down as leader in July 2005.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were also}} {{distinct}} {{because of the}} titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached <b>to</b> <b>despite</b> their different insignia. The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman {{was not allowed to}} be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the women officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers they served directly under. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely {{in the hands of the}} ATS, removing male influence from the process.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, {{the station}} applied with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate three {{repeater}} signals: channel 21 in Derry Township {{which was not}} used and the permit has expired, channel 23 in Uniontown, and channel 33 in New Castle. The signal in Derry Township was expected to cover all of Westmoreland County, while the Uniontown signal could penetrate into the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport. The New Castle signal might go into Youngstown, Ohio (which New Castle is much closer <b>to</b> <b>despite</b> {{being part of the}} Pittsburgh DMA) and serve as a secondary NBC affiliate for the Youngstown television market, which is primarily served by WFMJ-TV, while giving the Youngstown market an outlet for MeTV. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the virtual channels of its main signal and its three repeaters as its former VHF analog channel 11.|$|E

500|$|The Mississippi-class ships used a {{combination}} of Harvey- and Krupp-style armor (American-made), {{with much of the}} side armor backed with teak wood, consistent with other U.S. capital ships of the decade. The amount of armor and its strength was consistent with the preceding Connecticut class and in some cases was more complete in coverage and was thicker, especially compared to the earliest ships in that series. [...] The belt armor was thinner, [...] compared to , but longer, [...] compared <b>to</b> , <b>despite</b> the Mississippi class being shorter, [...] compared to [...] The primary turret armor was thicker by an inch— thick—as opposed to [...] on the USS Connecticut.|$|E
500|$|The new townships {{that black}} people were moved <b>to,</b> <b>despite</b> their [...] "dreary" [...] nature, also {{inspired}} politically charged music, a trend which continued into the 1970s. [...] "In Soweto" [...] by The Minerals {{has been described as}} an [...] "infectious celebration of a place" [...] and of the ability of its residents to build a community there. Yakhal' Inkhomo ("The Bellowing of the Bull", 1968), by Winston [...] "Mankunku" [...] Ngozi, was a jazz anthem that also expressed the political energy of the period. Theatrical performances incorporating music were also a feature of the townships, often narrowly avoiding censorship. The cultural isolation forced by apartheid led to artists within South Africa creating local adaptations of popular genres, including rock music, soul, and jazz.|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. Rick Lazio, a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters. [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed <b>to</b> <b>despite</b> frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think he needs to get into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E

500|$|The Winter Games {{have had}} only one {{national}} team boycott when Taiwan decided {{not to participate in}} the 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid. Prior to the Games the IOC agreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics {{for the first time since}} 1952. China was given permission to compete as the [...] "People's Republic of China" [...] (PRC) and to use the PRC flag and anthem. Until 1980 the island of Taiwan had been competing under the name [...] "Republic of China" [...] (ROC) and had been using the ROC flag and anthem. [...] The IOC attempted to have the countries compete together but when this proved to be unacceptable the IOC demanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the [...] "Republic of China". [...] The IOC renamed the island [...] "Chinese Taipei" [...] and demanded that it adopt a different flag and national anthem, stipulations that Taiwan would not agree <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> numerous appeals and court hearings the IOC's decision stood. When the Taiwanese athletes arrived at the Olympic village with their Republic of China identification cards they were not admitted. They subsequently left the Olympics in protest, just before the opening ceremonies. [...] Taiwan returned to Olympic competition at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo as Chinese Taipei. The country agreed to compete under a flag bearing the emblem of their National Olympic Committee and to play the anthem of their National Olympic Committee should one of their athletes win a gold medal. The agreement remains in place to this day.|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.|$|E

[...] His father Li Huaiyu, who was of Goguryeo extraction, was then serving as a {{military}} officer at Pinglu Circuit (then headquartered in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) under Li Huaiyu's cousin Hou Xiyi (侯希逸), who was the acting military governor of the circuit at that time. [...] By 761, however, the Pinglu army, which was cut {{off from the rest of}} the Tang realm by the rebel state of Yan at that time and had to further fend off not only Yan forces, but forces of Khitan and Xi tribes, could no longer stand, and they abandoned Pinglu Circuit and fought their way south. [...] In 762, Emperor Suzong's son and successor Emperor Daizong made Hou the military governor of Ziqing Circuit (淄青, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) as well, and the names of Ziqing and Pinglu merged. [...] In 765, the soldiers overthrew Hou because he was overburdening them with labor, and they supported Li Huaiyu as his successor. [...] Emperor Daizong agreed and made Li Huaiyu military governor, changing his name to Li Zhengji.

For this competition, HouseGuests were required to hang onto either a bar or rope while hanging inside of a glass box suspended in the air; the last HouseGuest remaining in their box is the winner. Sheila was the winner. During the competition, Sheila promised Natalie safety in exchange for {{dropping out of the}} competition, a deal which she agreed <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> this, all of the HouseGuests were united against Natalie that week. On Day 64, Sheila chose to nominate Adam and Sharon for eviction. That night, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "PoTV" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to use remote controls in an attempt to change the channels, thus forming an image on an over-sized television. The HouseGuest to complete the competition in the fastest time would be the winner. Adam was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 67, Adam chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Natalie being nominated in his place. Despite feeling safe, Natalie was later confronted by the other HouseGuests and questioned about her true intentions. Following this, Adam and Ryan {{came up with a plan}} to split the vote, forcing Sheila to cast the deciding vote. On Day 70, Natalie became the twelfth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Sheila broke a tie in Sharon's favor. She became the fifth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2015, Elizabeth Denham, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, {{published}} a 65-page report outlining how B.C. government officials had [...] "triple deleted" [...] emails {{relating to the}} Highway of Tears. In her report Access Denied, Denham describes the act of [...] "triple deleting" [...] as transferring an email to the [...] "deleted" [...] folder on a computer system, deleting the email from the folder and then overriding the backup that admits the system to retrieve deleted items. By deleting these files, Denham states the government had breached the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Denham {{became aware of the}} scandal in May 2015 after she received a letter from Tim Duncan, the former executive assistant to Transportation Minister Todd Stone. Duncan claimed that as he was responding to a FOI (Freedom of Information) application, ministerial assistant George Gretes ordered for Duncan to search his records for any files pertaining to the Highway of Tears and missing women. Once the files were located, Duncan testified that Gretes ordered for them to be deleted. When Duncan hesitated, Gretes allegedly took the keyboard and [...] "triple deleted" [...] all of the emails relating to the Highway of Tears. According to Denham, Gretes originally denied this claim but later admitted to the triple deletion during a second police interview. Denham states that Gretes—who resigned from his job in October 2015—would have then lied under oath. A year earlier in the summer of 2014, a team from the Transportation Ministry toured Highway 16 and conducted numerous meetings with Aboriginal leaders and communities. The significance of this project was to produce safer travel solutions for women living along Highway 16, many of whom had turned to hitchhiking as a way of transportation. In November 2014, the NDP made the FOI request seeking all government files pertaining to missing women, the Highway of Tears and meetings arranged by the ministry: the report Duncan would later respond <b>to.</b> <b>Despite</b> a two-month tour and multiple meetings, the B.C. government claimed the FOI request produced no files relating to the Highway of Tears. According to Denham's report, these records did exist until government officials destroyed them in order to [...] "skirt freedom of information laws". In Access Denied, Denham called upon the RCMP to further investigate the triple deletion of government files. In November 2015, Vancouver lawyer Mark Jetté was appointed as special prosecutor within the RCMP investigation. Jetté will act as the RCMP's independent legal advisor as well as administer an independent assessment of the evidence. He will also pursue any criminal charges that may be found appropriate.|$|E
