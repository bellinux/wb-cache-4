40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is threefold. First, we survey the way in which the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> has been proxied for in recent multi-country {{macro-economic}} studies. Second, we critically evaluate these proxies. Finally, we examine to what extent the conclusions of some studies change if some alternative indicator for the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> is employed. We conclude that the widely used tax ratios as developed by Mendoza et al. (1994) may not be very reliable. The choice of the indicator for the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> is also shown to affect the conclusions of some well-known empirical models. tax ratios, labour, average effective tax rates, unemployment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} Greenland’s tax system and contemplates changes that may be undertaken {{in the future to}} prepare for greater economic self-reliance and the country’s participation in the wider world economy. On the outskirts of Europe, Greenland is an autonomous part of the Danish kingdom, though currently {{not a member of the}} EU. However, its cooperation with European countries and its dependency on internationaltrade renders it necessary for the tax system in Greenland to be attuned to developments in the rest of the world. Drawing on a thorough international benchmarking analysis of Greenland’s tax system, the paper’s special focus will be on the corporate tax system and its interplay with personal taxation, as well as the system of import duties. In particular, we carry out computations of effective marginal and average corporate tax rates, as well as average effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> consumption, <b>labour</b> income and capital income, and compare these to similar measures for EU countries. In addition, we outline how Greenland’s economic policy in other areas interferes with tax policy. Especially fishery regulation, management of governmentowned companies, and housing policy have major implications for the tax system. international benchmarking, effective tax rates, Greenland...|$|R

Formerly {{a lawyer and}} minister, he had no experience of finance, and opponents deplored {{that he would have}} to [...] "learn on the job". On 14 May 2008 he remarked that: [...] ".. the risks that we identified in the last Budget have materialised, risks such as recent developments in the international financial markets, further appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling, lower international growth and domestically a sharper slowdown in housing". Ignoring the property bubble, he concluded that: [...] ".. we are well placed to absorb the housing adjustments and external ‘shocks’ so that our medium-term prospects will continue to be favourable. Our public finances are sound, with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area. Our markets are flexible allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments.

40|$|This paper argues {{against the}} policy {{position}} {{that begins with}} a doomsday scenario of publicly provided health insurance and pension systems threatened with collapse under the stresses imposed by population ageing, and instead contends {{that the threat of}} crisis in these systems is policy driven. The central thesis of the paper is that a range of policies lead to the creation of an ageing crisis by inhibiting the efficient reallocation of female labour from the home to the market in response to the decline in fertility. The analysis focuses on family support policies that create large effective <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> female <b>labour</b> supply, by means testing the support on family income, or selectively on the second income. Examples include Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B, the Medicare Levy and the Medicare Safety Net. The analysis draws on household survey data to show that female labour supply is strongly positively associated with household saving, the purchase of private health insurance and spending on family health generally. Policies that inhibit female labour supply therefore have the effect of reducing the tax base for funding public pensions and health care, while simultaneously reducing the capacity of families to fund them privately. 1...|$|R

40|$|Measures {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> have been advocated to alleviate the EU unemployment problem. Most of the analyses document {{a relationship between the}} unemployment rate and the <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour.</b> Hence, {{it is not possible to}} discern whether the effect on unemployment derives from labour demand, labour supply or through the wage formation mechanism. Moreover, the empirical analyses are usually static, and may be indicative of the steady-state determinants of the unemployment rate and do not reveal the features of the adjustment process. This paper studies the relationship between labour taxes and labour costs by modelling the wage formation mechanism in a dynamic context. We test if the composition of labour taxes affects labour costs in the short- and in the long-run and whether highly centralised bargaining systems have better employment performance than decentralised ones. We apply static and dynamic panel data techniques to a panel of EU countries. Our findings suggest that there is probably some wage resistance in the short-term but not in the long-term, although the transition to the long-term can be very long and therefore the short- term impact and the dynamics of adjustment can be long-lasting.

40|$|Fiscal {{policy is}} {{examined}} {{in a model}} of an open economy which is characterised by unemployment caused by efficiency wages. It is shown that the conventional conclusion, according to which mobile capital is untaxed {{in the presence of}} wage taxation, is not generally valid. A positive capital tax allows to indirectly tax profits, thereby mitigating unemployment through the reduction in the effective <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour.</b> It is argued that these policy conclusions are qualitatively unaffected by the cause of unemployment. Moreover, the welfare loss from labour market imperfections increases when tax bases become internationally mobile, which suggests an increasing relevance of domestic labour market reforms. ...|$|E

In contrast to many other studies, we use long time series and analyze cyclically adjusted trend values of the unemployment rate. Our novel contribution is the estimation of panel models where we allow for heterogeneous effects of institutions on unemployment. Our main results are that on the average a tighter employment protection, a higher <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> income and a more generous unemployment insurance system increase, whereas a higher centralization of wage negotiations decreases unemployment.

40|$|As {{theoretical}} and empirical studies show, {{the size of the}} public sector in itself has little effect on growth and employment. Of greater relevance is the structure of government revenue and spending.

The <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>labour</b> well exceeds the EU average and keeps increasing. Shifting taxes away from labour and more towards environmentally harmful activities and capital stock would promote growth and employment. Spending on education, investments and R&D is particularly liable to strengthen economic growth.
