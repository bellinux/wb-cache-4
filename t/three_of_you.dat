In doing so, she {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} a previous Miss Syracuse/Miss New York, Vanessa Williams, who (as Miss America 1984) was the first African American winner of the pageant. She is also the second Asian American contestant to be crowned Miss America (the first was Filipino American Angela Perez Baraquio in 2001). NPR's Michael Martin commented on this aspect of her win by noting that “there were five Asian-Americans competing for the crown. That's the highest number in pageant history. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> were in the top five. Two of you were the finalists, and this in a contest where initially the requirements were that contestants be of good health and of the white race." ...|$|E

[...] Today, you enjoy the admiration of the brave soldiers who have relieved you at the cost of so much hardship and bloodshed. [...] Tomorrow, all France will applaud you.

2500|$|Believed to {{have been}} written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also {{inferred}} to directly reference Lancaster. [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares [...] "my suffisaunce" [...] (15) and that [...] "over himself hath the maystrye" [...] (14). [...] Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims {{that he does not}} know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, [...] "And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve" [...] (32, 40, 48). [...] Chaucer retorts that [...] "My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse" [...] (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. [...] Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and [...] "Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne" [...] (78–79). [...] The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, [...] "as <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> or tweyne," [...] to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of {{at least two of the}} three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's [...] "beste frend". [...] Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, [...] "And also, you still have your best friend alive" [...] (32, 40, 48); she also references his [...] "beste frend" [...] in the envoy when appealing to his [...] "noblesse" [...] to help Chaucer to a higher estate. [...] A fifth reference is made by [...] "Chaucer as narrator" [...] who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. [...] While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.|$|E
