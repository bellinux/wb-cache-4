40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} presynaptic calcium {{diffusion model}} developed {{to account for}} characteristics of transmitter release was modified to provide for binding of calcium to a receptor and subsequent triggering of exocytosis. When low affinity (20 microM) and rapid kinetics were assumed for the calcium receptor triggering exocytosis, and stimulus parameters were selected to match those of experiments, the simulations predicted a virtual invariance of {{the time course of}} transmitter release to paired stimulation, stimulation with pulses of different amplitude, and stimulation in different calcium solutions. The large temperature sensitivity of experimental release time course was explained by a temperature sensitivity of the model's final rate limiting exocytotic process. Inclusion of calcium tail currents and a saturable buffer with finite binding kinetics resulted in high peak calcium transients near release sites, exceeding 100 microM. Models with a single class of calcium binding site to the secretory <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> failed to produce sufficient synaptic facilitation under this condition. When at least one calcium ion binds to a different site having higher affinity and slow kinetics, facilitation again reaches levels similar to those seen experimentally. It is possible that the neurosecretory <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> reacts with calcium at more than one class of binding site...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for providing feedback control for polypeptide drugs in a polymeric controlled-release system uses a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> and a polymer-bound enzyme that, {{in the presence}} of that <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule,</b> will cause an acid or a base to form. When the pH inside the polymer system changes, the solubility of the drug shifts dramatically, which changes the diffusion or dissolution driving force, and hence the release rate changes correspondingly. This concept was tested using a controlled-release system of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer containing insulin and immobilized glucose oxidase. The enzymatic reaction of glucose to gluconic acid reduces the pH in the polymer microenvironment. Since insulin solubility increases with decreasing pH (at physiologic pH, this is true for an insulin with an isoelectric point of 7. 4 or higher), the release of insulin increases in response to glucose concentration. The feasibility of this concept has been shown using trilysyl insulin with an isoelectric point of 7. 4. Multiple exposures to buffered glucose solutions over several weeks caused insulin release to reversibly increase during each exposure. Polymer-implanted diabetic rats infused with glucose solutions showed a significant increase in insulin concentration in 30 min-an effect not observed in three different sets of control rats...|$|E
40|$|Transformation of Mucor circinelloides with self-replicative {{plasmids}} {{containing a}} wild-type {{copy of the}} carotenogenic gene carB causes silencing of the carB function in 3 % of transformants. Genomic analyses revealed a relationship between silenced phenotype and number of copies of plasmids. This phenotype results from a reduction of the steady-state levels of carB mRNA, a reduction that is not {{due to differences in}} the level of transcription, indicating that silencing is post-transcriptional. Small sense and antisense RNAs {{have been found to be}} associated with gene silencing in M. circinelloides. Two size classes of small antisense RNAs, differentially accumulated during the vegetative growth of silenced transformants, have been detected: a long 25 -nucleotide RNA and a short 21 -nucleotide RNA. Secondary sense and antisense RNAs corresponding to sequences of the endogenous gene downstream of the initial <b>triggering</b> <b>molecule</b> have also been detected, revealing the existence of spreading of RNA targeting in fungi. These findings, together with the self-replicative nature of the <b>triggering</b> <b>molecules,</b> make M. circinelloides a suitable organism for investigating some unresolved questions in RNA silencing...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} two mouse monoclonal antibodies, D 7. 5 and Gi. 4, that each can cause secretion of cytolytic factors from natural killer (NK) cells and resting T cells in humans, rats, and hamsters. Toward elucidation of the molecular {{identity and the}} transmembrane signaling mechanism of the antibody-defined <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules,</b> we investigated 1) their surface density, 2) the crosslinking requirement for signaling, and 3) their ability to mobilize intracellular calcium ions. Equilibrium binding studies using monovalent Fab fragments of D 7. 5 showed the presence of approximately 20, 000 <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules</b> per thymus cell and an antibody dissociation constant of 1. 8 x 106 M. Thymus cells incubated {{in the presence of}} either intact or Fab fragments of D 7. 5 acquired the ability to lyse Yac- 1 cells. Furthermore, the incubation media of thymocytes that were treated with either intact or Fab fragments of D 7. 5 contained effector-cell derived factors that could lyse Yac- 1 cells. Flow cytometry measurements of changes in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 J) in thymocytes. A significantly elevated level of [Ca 2 was observed at 60 s after antibody addition and this response, which required the external calcium source, increased continuously during the 30 mm incubation. Further-more, dbCAMP plus theophylline did not alter the ability of D 7. 5 to induce calcium mobilization suggesting that the antibody-defined trigger may not use the signaling pathway involving breakdown of phosphatidylinositol.

Capitalizing on control components that enable Caulobacter crescentus to metabolize vanillic acid originating from lignin degradation that occurs in its oligotrophic freshwater habitat, we have designed synthetic devices that specifically adjust transgene expression in mammalian cells when exposed to vanillic acid.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} description {{has been}} made of an enzyme amplification mechanism involving the coupling of two substrate cycles. In this amplification system one of the noncycling products of a first substrate cycle acts as a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> that continuously feeds a second substrate cycle. Time-concentration equations describing the evolution of the species involved in the system have been obtained. The model is illustrated by the quantification of nanomolar levels of ADP (and/or ATP) in a continuous assay involving the enzymes L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-lactate oxidase to cycle the pyruvate accumulated in a first enzymatic cycle constituted by the enzymes pyruvate kinase and hexokinase. Progress curves were seen to be parabolic, and, according to the kinetic equations obtained, followed second-order polynomials of the reaction time. Mathematical equations for minimizing the cost of the assays are also given. The model is applicable to the amplified analytical determination of low levels of a metabolite or an enzyme activity, and its amplification capacity, together with the simplicity of determining kinetic parameters, enable it to be employed in enzyme immunoassays to increase the magnitude of the measured response...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{theme in}} immunology finds receptors which initiate cellular effector programs forming multichain complexes {{in which the}} ligand recognition elements associate {{with one or more}} 'trigger molecules' whose aggregation initiates a signal transduction cascade. The sequence motifs constituting the active sites of these trigger molecules are found in the T cell and B cell antigen receptors, and some Fc receptors, and appear to be central to effector function activation. For example, of the many molecules that mimic or potentiate the action of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), none have yet been found to initiate effector programs autonomously in cells lacking TCR. We have devised two strategies to study activation mediated by myeloid Fc receptors, which appear not to associate with trigger molecules: the use of primary human cytolytic T cells as surrogate effector cells for genetically delivered receptors, and the use of vaccinia virus vectors to introduce genetically modified receptors into primary human monocytes. Using these approaches, we have found that the cytoplasmic domains of two Fc receptors show comparable function to equivalent domains of the <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> family, but are not homologous to members of that family...|$|E
40|$|Some {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) against interleukin (IL) 1 alpha {{have been}} found to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC, human peripheral blood monocytes and B lymphocytes), so that unstimulated T lymphocytes cultured with them are induced to proliferate and secrete IL- 2. Control mAbs of the same isotypes and mAbs against IL- 1 beta do not activate APC. In the absence of APC, mAbs against IL- 1 alpha do not induce proliferation of T lymphocytes. Mitomycin C-treated activated APC still induce T-cell proliferation. Proliferation of T lymphocytes cannot be induced by culture supernatants and requires contact with APC activated by mAbs against IL- 1 alpha.

40|$|Here {{we review}} {{recombinant}} proteins with a capability for dual-targeting. These molecules address two different antigens {{on the same}} tumor cell and therefore are called “dual-targeting agents”. By virtue of binding a chosen pair of antigens on the malignant cell, preferential binding to antigen double-positive over single-positive cells can be achieved when both {{are present in the}} same environment. Therapeutic effects of such agents are based on different modes of action: (1) They can act as pro-apoptotic agents or by inhibiting pro-survival signals; (2) The dual recognition moiety can be fused to effector-domains, such as bacterial toxins or other drugs, leading to the generation of bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs); (3) Dual-targeting agents can further be used to redirect an effector-cell to the tumor. A new generation of scFv-derived fusion proteins are the tandem single chain triplebodies (sctbs), which carry two scFv binding sites for antigens on the tumor cell plus a third, specific for a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> on an effector cell. The ability of preferential or selective targeting of antigen double-positive over single-positive cells opens attractive new perspectives for the use of dual-targeting agents in cancer therapy, and possibly also for the treatment of certain inflammatory and autoimmune disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and release}} of nitrogen oxide (NO) molecules {{at the surface}} of Fe-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles, made by a template-free sol–gel process, has been studied. Fe 3 + ions {{are found to be}} highly effective NO adsorption sites in Fe/TiO 2. Up to [similar] 89 μmol g− 1 of the adsorbed NO can be released by exposure to trace amounts of H 2 O, which exceeds the water-induced release capacity of other NO storage materials by at least a factor of 2. The surprising efficiency of water as a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> for NO release is due to its large dipole moment, which causes a much stronger coordination to the Fe 3 + species than is the case for NO. In addition, a new IR band at 1840 cm− 1 has been found for Fe-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles exposed to NO gas. This band is assigned to the stretch vibration of an NO species coordinatively bonded to an Fe 3 + site. In contrast to Fe 2 +–NO vibrations in e. g. zeolites, Fe 3 +–NO vibrations are seldom observed, {{and this is the first}} time that convincing evidence is reported for the presence of Fe 3 +–NO in Fe/TiO 2.

40|$|CD 64 (Fc?RI) receptors {{represent}} highly potent trigger molecules for activated polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and mediate lysis of a {{range of}} tumors in the presence of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. An huCD 64 transgenic mouse model designed to analyze the therapeutic activity of a panel of bispecific F(ab') 2 (BsAb) in retargeting granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) –activated PMN against syngeneic B-cell lymphomas is reported. This model allows careful analysis of the individual elements of the therapeutic process. BsAb were directed against immunoglobulin-idiotype (Id), major histocompatibility class II (MHC II), or CD 19 on the tumors and huCD 64 on the effectors. In vitro cytotoxicity assays and in vivo tumor tracking showed that, provided effectors were activated with G-CSF, all 3 derivatives destroyed and cleared lymphoma cells, with (huCD 64 ?×?MHC II) proving by far the most cytotoxic in vitro. However, though all derivatives delivered some survival advantage, only the [huCD 64 ?×?Id] BsAb provided long-term protection to tumor-bearing animals. These results demonstrate that CD 64 -recruited cytotoxic effectors operate in vivo but that the (huCD 64 ?×?Id) conferred an additional anti-tumor function essential for long-term protection. T-cell depletion studies demonstrated that this extra therapeutic activity with [huCD 64 ?×?Id] was totally dependent on CD 4 and CD 8 T cells and that mice, once “cured” with BsAb, were resistant to tumor rechallenge. These findings indicate that CD 64 is an effective <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> for delivering cytokine-activated PMN against tumor in vivo and that, provided tumor targets are selected appropriately, CD 64 -based BsAb can establish long-term T-cell immunity. <br/...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a natural}} endogenous process by which double-stranded RNA <b>molecules</b> <b>trigger</b> potent and specific gene silencing in eukaryotic cells and is characterized by target RNA cleavage. In mammals, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules</b> of choice and constitute {{a new class of}} RNA-based antiviral agents. In an efficient RNAi response, the antisense strand of siRNAs must enter the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in a process mediated by thermodynamic features. In this report, we hypothesize that silent mutations capable of inverting thermodynamic properties can promote resistance to siRNAs. Extensive computational analyses were used to assess whether continuous selective pressure that promotes such mutations could lead to the emergence of viral strains completely resistant to RNAi (i. e., prone to transfer only the sense strands to RISC). Based on our findings, we propose that, although synonymous mutations may produce functional resistance, this strategy cannot be systematically adopted by viruses since the longest RNAi-refractory sequence is only 10 nt long. This finding also suggests that all mRNAs display fluctuating thermodynamic landscapes and that, in terms of thermodynamic features, RNAi is a very efficient antiviral system since there will always be sites susceptible to siRNAs.

This approach was also effective in disseminated tumors and when treatment was delayed until three weeks after the inoculation of the tumor, thus establishing this approach as the most effective model of an immunomodulating therapy of human neoplasms. Early observations with an ongoing phase I/II study with CD 16 /CD 30 Bi-MAb in patients with refrac-tory Hodgkin's disease confirm the expected low toxicity. If these observations can be confirmed in larger clinical studies, effector cell activating Bi-MAbs could become an important weapon in the remaining fight for the conquest of Hodgkin's disease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{remarkable}} aspects about RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans is that the <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules,</b> dsRNA, can be administered via the animal's food.

We found that one isolate from Hawaii had a defect in RNAi that was specific to the germline and was a result of multiple mutations in a PAZ/PIWI domain-containing protein, which we named PPW- 1. Deleting ppw- 1 in the canonical C. elegans strain Bristol N 2 makes it resistant to feeding of dsRNA directed against germline-expressed genes. PPW- 1 belongs to the Argonaute family of proteins, which act in posttranscriptional gene silencing and development, and is homologous to the RNAi gene rde- 1.

40|$|Calgranulin B {{is a small}} calcium-binding protein {{with several}} {{immunological}} functions mainly involved in chronic inflammation and cancer. It can participate in recruitment of neutrophils and leukocytes in inflamed tissue, oxidant/antioxidant balance, adhesion of neutrophils to fibronectin, and regulation of apoptosis. In a previous proteomic study, we found that calgranulin B was up-regulated in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with respect to controls and patients with other interstitial lung diseases. The aims {{of this study are}} to compare calgranulin B concentrations in BAL of patients with IPF and sarcoidosis and controls by a quantitative method, to look for correlations with clinical data, and to evaluate calgranulin B expression in lung tissue of IPF patients by immunohistochemistry. A modification of a commercial ELISA was used to determine calgranulin B concentrations in BAL of 16 patients with IPF (a group of patients in which we previously performed proteomic analysis), 17 patients with sarcoidosis, and 7 controls. The immunohistochemistry was done in a subgroup of patients with IPF and a control group of lung transplant donors. Calgranulin B concentrations were significantly higher in patients with IPF than controls (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); they were inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO values and directly correlated with neutrophil and eosinophil percentages in BAL. Immunohistochemistry revealed a patchy distribution of calgranulin B, predominantly around areas of fibrotic remodeling. Calgranulin B may be a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> involved in the evolution and progression of IPF, being overexpressed in BAL of patients with IPF with severe functional deterioration and in the peribronchiolar area bordering zones of honeycombing...|$|E
40|$|FcRIII is {{not present}} on {{peripheral}} blood monocytes, but becomes expressed upon culturing and can be demonstrated on tissue macrophages. We studied the expression of FcRIII of cultured monocytes in detail and compared its structure with FcRIII of neutrophils and NK cells. The cell density of FcRIII reached a plateau within 3 days of culturing. During that time, the expression of FcRI and FcRIIa, also present on monocytes, did not change significantly. FcRIII on cultured monocytes lacked, as did NK cell FcRIII, the NA 1 -allotypic variant of the NA system present on the neutrophil FcRIII. Studies with glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C and analysis of cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria revealed that FcRIII on cultured monocytes is not anchored by phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan in the cell membrane. Similarly, FcRIII on NK cells was resistant to glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C treatment, suggesting that NK cell FcRIII is also not anchored by a phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan moiety, in contrast to neutrophil FcRIII. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the FcRIII of cultured monocytes had a similar mobility as the FcRIII on NK cells, but was clearly distinct from neutrophil FcRIII. Treatment with N-glycanase showed that the protein backbone of deglycosylated FcRIII of cultured monocytes {{was similar to that}} of FcRIII of NK cells, but deglycosylated neutrophil FcRIII was different. Specific blocking of FcRIII of cultured monocytes with an anti-FcRIII mAb did not reduced the lytic action of the cultured monocytes towards sensitized erythrocytes. However, FcRIII was modulated from the cell surface by incubation with sensitized E, whereas non-FcR Ag were not.

40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAb) directed against human monocyte surface antigens was tested for {{their capacity to}} mediate signal transduction by measuring luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). The response patterns fell into three categories. The mAb Mo 4, OKM 3, OKM 6 and antibodies specific for Fc receptor (FcR) type I and II did not mediate signal transduction directly or were weak triggers, but upon second-order cross-linking by goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) F(ab') 2 or rabbit anti-mouse Ig, a strong CL response was induced. The mAb recognizing different epitopes on CD 11 b (complement receptor type III alpha chain) were unique {{in their ability to}} induce a CL response either by direct stimulation or by second-order cross-linking. The mAb 3 G 8 recognizing FcR type III (FcRIII; CD 16) on a monocyte subpopulation and CD 36 -specific monoclonals directly elicited a CL response. A response of similar magnitude was obtained with 3 G 8 F(ab') 2 or with intact 3 G 8. Furthermore, elutriation-centrifugation-purified monocytes were stimulated by 3 G 8 to a similar extent as unseparated mononuclear cells, whereas lymphocytes did not respond. This suggests that a FcRIII-expressing monocyte subpopulation may mediate effector functions, including the generation of reactive oxygen species, via FcRIII triggering. Our finding that anti-CD 36 F(ab') 2 directly induces an oxidative burst is the first evidence that CD 36 itself is a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule.</b> CD 36, which is thought to interact with erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum and with thrombospondin, may constitute a signal-transducing element and thus may have functions extending beyond mediation of adherence. The present CL system constitutes a simple assay for detecting mAb directed against monocyte surface signalling elements. Probing mAb for signal transduction requires suspended cells and antibodies in the fluid phase in order to avoid inadvertent FcR triggering, which may occur when cells are stimulated by surface-adherent whole antibodies...|$|E

However, the mechanisms We speculate that oxLDL may activate a cellular suicide pathway that leads to apoptosis. Methods and Results Human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with increasing doses of native or oxLDL specific for histone-associated DNA fragments and confirmed with DNA laddering. Native LDL had no effect, but incubation with oxLDL dose-dependently induced apoptosis of HUVEC. Induction of apoptosis by oxLDL was associated with increased CPP 32 -like protease activity, which is the major enzyme that initiates the proteolytical cascade leading to cell death. Specific inhibition of CPP 32 activity completely abrogated oxLDL-induced apoptosis. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and the combination of vitamins C and E prevented oxLDL-induced apoptosis, abrogated the enhancement of CPP 32 -like protease activity, and inhibited the proteolytic cleavage of CPP 32 into its active subunit p 17.

We evaluated {{the potential of}} antibody derivatives against epidermal growth factor receptor and G 250, which are 2 candidate antigens on renal cell carcinoma, to recruit effector cells for killing renal cell carcinoma. Material and methods: {{as a measure of}} cytotoxicity, 51 chromium release assays against renal cell carcinoma lines were performed using unseparated blood or isolated cell populations as the source of effectors. Blood was obtained from healthy donors, or from patients receiving granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for enhancing effector cell function. Parental human IgG 1 antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor and G 250 were compared with respective chemically linked bispecific antibodies targeting IgA Fc receptor FcalphaRI (CD 89), a novel cytotoxic <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> on polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes/macrophages, which were constructed by chemically crosslinking appropriate F(ab') fragments. Results: renal cell carcinoma lines were highly resistant to complement dependent lysis. With mononuclear effector cells high levels of renal cell carcinoma killing were observed with a humanized epidermal growth factor receptor directed monoclonal antibody, while the same antibody did not recruit granulocytes (polymorphonuclear cells) for antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. However, polymorphonuclear cells effectively lysed renal cell carcinoma with [FcalphaRI x epidermal growth factor receptor] bispecific antibody. FcalphaRI mediated killing was significantly enhanced when the blood of patients on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor therapy was analyzed. However, G 250 mediated only low levels of killing with mononuclear cell but not with polymorphonuclear effector cells. Conclusions: targeting epidermal growth factor receptor proved to recruit efficiently mononuclear or polymorphonuclear cell mediated killing mechanisms, while G 250 directed antibody constructs were significantly less effective. Particularly effective renal cell carcinoma killing was observed with combined [FcalphaRI x epidermal growth factor receptor] bispecific antibody and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{pheromone}} mating pathway in baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enables this organism {{to initiate}} a developmental response upon detection of a mating pheromone. Stimulation of the Ste 2 receptor by an external <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> {{in one of the}} haploid mating cells of yeast MATa, results in the transcriptional induction of a subset of yeast genes. The aim {{of this study is to}} convert this system into a readily measurable response, to function as a biosensor. It is crucial for the improved system to be exclusive from the wild-type response. A successful improved system should be able to detect other peptides, such as peptide markers in diseases. An invivo luciferase activity assay utilizing a PFUS 1 :LUC construct, was developed to report the activation of the pathway. Deletions of both FAR 1 and SST 2 genes were proven to provide an increased signal to noise ratio. As an attempt to decouple Ste 2 and its ligand, three α-factor analogues; N 3 G, E 7 and C 3 G, were found to stimulate the mating pathway in decreasing order. A modified Ste 12 (Ste 12 mod) transcription factor coupled with a modified pheromone response element (PREmod 2) partnership was also designed. A library of Ste 12 mod was constructed by random mutagenesis of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. The mutant Ste 12 plasmids were transformed into a far 1  sst 2  ste 12  strain complemented with pFUS 1 (mod 2) K. Screening for mutants with an increased resistance to G 418 resulted in 17 unique mutations. Further screening by mating and luciferase assays narrowed down to one mutation (F 45 I) that responds to modified PRE. However, this strain successfully mated with the wild-type, which warrant further modifications and screening to achieve a full orthogonal system. The results in this study not only provided more insight to the physical interaction between Ste 12 and PRE, but also the possibility of uncoupling a pathway in an already developed system...|$|E
40|$|Immunotherapy is a {{powerful}} anti-cancer treatment modality. However, despite numerous encouraging results obtained in pre-clinical studies, a definite breakthrough towards an established clinical treatment modality has as yet not occurred. Antibodies against tumor antigens {{have been shown to}} localise {{at the site of the}} tumor, but inadequate triggering of immune effector mechanisms have thwarted clinical efficacy thus far. Cellular immunotherapy has been hampered by limitations such as lack of specificity, down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -expression or Fas ligand up-regulation on tumor cells. This review focuses on the use of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) for immunotherapy of cancer. Using BsAbs, it is possible to take advantage of the highly specific binding characteristics of antibodies and combine these with the powerful effector functions of cytotoxic immune effector cells. BsAbs share two different, monoclonal antibody-derived, antigen-recognizing moieties within one molecule. By dual binding, BsAbs reactive with a <b>trigger</b> <b>molecule</b> on an immune effector cell on the one hand and a surface antigen on a tumor target cell on the other are thus able to functionally focus the lytic activity of the immune effector cell towards the target cell. Over the last few years, the concept of BsAb-mediated tumor cell killing has been studied extensively both in preclinical models and in a number of phase I clinical trials. Promising pre-clinical results have been reported using tumor models in which diverse immune effector cell populations have been used. Despite this pre-clinical in vivo efficacy, the first clinical trials indicate that we are still not in a position to successfully treat human malignancies. This review discusses the production of BsAbs, the choice of trigger molecules in combination with potential effector cells and the preclinical models that have led to the current use of BsAbs in experimental clinical trials. It has become clear that appropriate immune cell activation and establishing a favourable effector-to-target cell ratio will have direct impact on the efficacy of the therapeutic approaches using BsAbs. New directions are discussed, i. e. finding appropriate dosage schemes by which immune effector cells become redirected without inducing hyporesponsiveness, defining possibilities for combining different immune effector cell populations and creating an in situ tumor environment that allows maximal tumoricidal activity.

40|$|Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the {{endotoxins}} of Gram-negative bacteria, {{are located}} in the outer leaflet of their outer membrane. LPS {{has been shown to be}} one of the most important <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules</b> of the immune system, in particular with respect to the induction of cytokines such as tumor-necrosis-factor α (TNF-α) in human mononuclear cells. Their biological activities range from beneficial ones at low to pathophysiological effects at higher LPS concentrations, the latter frequently leading in humans to septic shock, for which still no effective therapy is available. We have shown that a prerequisite of endotoxic activity is the existence of a cubic or a mixed cubic/unilamellar aggregate structure of the lipid moiety of LPS, lipid A (Fig. 1, bottom). This is valid for e. g. the hexaacyl lipid A from Escherchia coli, whereas lipid A with a changed chemical structure such as the pentaacylated lipid A from Rhodobacter capsulatus or a mutant LPS from E. coli forming multilamellar structures (Fig. 1, top) are agonistically inactive, but may act antagonistically against agonistic LPS [1].

40|$|Since {{little is}} known about Tc cells in the human immune {{response}} to intracellular parasites, we have studied the role of Tc cells in response to M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Donors whose PBMC responded to BCG, purified protein derivative (PPD), and the recombinant 65 -kD heat shock protein (HSP) of BCG generated BCG/PPD- specific CD 4 + effector T lymphocytes that lysed PPD as well as recombinant 65 -kD-pulsed monocytes. Nonpulsed or irrelevant antigen- pulsed target cells were lysed to a much lower but still significant extent. PPD-stimulated effector lymphocytes of a recombinant 65 -kD nonresponder lysed PPD but not recombinant 65 -kD-pulsed monocytes. Recombinant 65 -kD-educated effector lymphocytes lysed both recombinant 65 -kD- and PPD-pulsed monocytes. In addition, these effector cells efficiently lysed nonpulsed target cells. These results demonstrate that in recombinant 65 -kD responders, the recombinant 65 -kD HSP of BCG is an immunodominant target as well as a <b>triggering</b> <b>molecule</b> for BCG/PPD-specific CD 4 + cytotoxic T cells that lyse autologous monocytes. The implications of these findings with respect {{to the role of the}} 65 - kD HSP in autoimmunity are discussed...|$|R

40|$|CD 69 C-type lectin {{receptor}} {{represents a}} functional <b>triggering</b> <b>molecule</b> on activated NK cells, capable of directing their natural killing function. The receptor-proximal signaling pathways activated by CD 69 cross-linking {{and involved in}} CD 69 -mediated cytotoxic activity are still poorly understood. Here we show that CD 69 engagement leads to the rapid and selective activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk, but not of the closely related member of the same family, ZAP 70, in IL- 2 -activated human NK cells. Our results indicate the requirement for Src family kinases in the CD 69 -triggered activation of Syk and suggest a role for Lek in this event. We also demonstrate that Syk and Src family tyrosine kinases control the CD 69 -triggered tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cgamma 2 and the Rho family-specific exchange factor Vav 1 and are responsible for CD 69 -triggered cytotoxicity of activated NK cells. The same CD 69 -activated signaling pathways are also observed in an RBL transfectant clone, constitutively expressing the receptor. These data demonstrate {{for the first time}} that the CD 69 receptor functionally couples to the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases, which, by inducing Syk activation, initiate downstream signaling pathways and regulate CD 69 -triggered functions on human NK cells...|$|R
40|$|CD 69 {{represents}} a functional <b>triggering</b> <b>molecule</b> on activated NK and T cells, capable of inducing cytotoxic activity and costimulating cytokine production. It {{belongs to the}} C-lectin type superfamily, and its gene maps in the NK gene complex, close to other genes coding for NK receptors;CD 94 /NKG 2 -A complex is the inhibitory receptor for the non classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E on human NK cells. To investigate CD 69 -initiated signal transduction pathways, and to evaluate CD 94 /NKG 2 -A interference on CD 69 triggering ability, we have generated transfectants expressing both receptors in the RBL cell line. Here we report that CD 69 engagement leads to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) enzymes belonging to the MAPK family, and that this event is required for CD 69 -mediated cell degranulation. Moreover, we show that the co-engagement of CD 94 /NKG 2 -A inhibitory receptor effectively suppresses both CD 69 -triggered cell degranulation in RBL transfectants, through the inhibition of ERK activation, and CD 69 -induced cytotoxicity in human NK cells; Thus, here we provide new information on the molecular mechanisms initiated by CD 69 activation receptor, and show that CD 69 -initiated signaling pathways and functional activity are negatively regulated by CD 94 /NKG 2 -A inhibitory complex...|$|R
40|$|Unmodified {{antibodies}} (abs) {{have been}} successful in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but less so for the treatment of solid tumors. They trigger anti-tumor effects through their Fc-domains, and one way to improve their efficacy is to optimize their interaction with the effectors through Fc-engineering. Another way to empower abs is the design of bispecific abs and related fusion proteins allowing a narrower choice of effector cells. Here we review frequently chosen classes of effector cells, as well as common <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules.</b> Natural Killer (NK) - and T-cells are the most investigated populations in therapeutical approaches with bispecific agents until now. Catumaxomab, the first bispecific ab to receive drug approval, targets the tumor antigen Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) and recruits T-cells via a binding site for the cell surface protein CD 3. The next generation of recombinant ab-derivatives replaces the broadly reactive Fc-domain by a binding domain for a single selected trigger. Blinatumomab is the first clinically successful member of this class, targeting cancer cells via CD 19 and engaging T-cells by CD 3. Other investigators have developed related recombinant fusion proteins to recruit effectors, such as NK-cells and macrophages. The first such agents currently in preclinical and clinical development will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{vaccines}} such as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, {{are gradually}} {{giving way to}} more biochemically defined vaccines that are most often based on a recombinant antigen known to possess neutralizing epitopes. Such vaccines can offer improvements in speed, safety and manufacturing process but an inevitable consequence of their high degree of purification is that immunogenicity is reduced through the lack of the innate <b>triggering</b> <b>molecules</b> present in more complex preparations. Targeting recombinant vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells however can improve immunogenicity by ensuring that antigen processing is as efficient as possible. Immune complexes, {{one of a number}} of routes of APC targeting, are mimicked by a recombinant approach, crystallizable fragment (Fc) fusion proteins, in which the target immunogen is linked directly to an antibody effector domain capable of interaction with receptors, FcR, on the APC cell surface. A number of virus Fc fusion proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and shown to be efficiently produced and purified. Their use for immunization next to non-Fc tagged equivalents shows that they are powerfully immunogenic in the absence of added adjuvant and that immune stimulation is the result of the Fc-FcR interaction...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation starts {{whenever}} antigens <b>trigger</b> <b>molecules</b> and {{cells of}} the immune system causing them to move to the affected site. This forms part of the body's response to internal and external environmental stimuli that normally eliminate the offending organism or cells and restore the tissue physiology. We have previously shown that chronic inflammation may lead to prostate carcinogenesis in both animal and human models. Substantial data has shown that over 25 % of all cancer cases are related to chronic inflammation, and other types of unresolved inflammatory processes. Further evidence for this relationship is the fact that prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with reduced risk to developing many types of cancers. Here we review current available internationally published papers in view of several reports on inflammation and cancer progression and draw a synthesis to provide a concise insight to the emerging field of inflammation and cancer. In particular, the molecular mechanisms underlying the concept of inflammation-mediated cancer development, progression, invasion and metastasis was discussed in detail. Indeed, we provide details to allow readers understand the very new concept that underpin the dual host-protective and tumor-promoting actions of cancer immunoediting and present substantial scientific data that strongly suggest that inflammatory markers might be potent molecular targets for cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring an...|$|R
