500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} {{following}} {{his return to}} Australia, Ponsford continued to make large scores. He started the season by hitting 214runs (out of a Victoria team total of 315) against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval and followed this with 151 at the MCG against Queensland. In his next match, against New South Wales, Ponsford again rewrote the record books. Ponsford scored 352runs, 334 {{of them in a}} single day, and helped Victoria to an innings total of 1,107, which remains the highest team total in first-class cricket, breaking Victoria's own record set four years earlier. After Ponsford played the ball back on to his stumps to be dismissed bowled, he then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his broken wicket and famously said, [...] "Cripes, I am unlucky." [...] For the season, Ponsford went on to score 1,229runs at an average of 122.90, including six centuries and two half-centuries from only ten innings.|$|E
2500|$|The globe {{was changed}} {{one last time}} on 5 September 1981 to the double striped BBC1 logo, sitting below a lime green and blue globe on navy blue background. Also, the globe was repainted about this time, which {{resulted}} in South Africa having a pointed tip. The idents were generated by the Nexus Orthicon Display Device (abbreviated to NODD and pronounced [...] "noddy"), which worked by filming an image {{in black and white}} and electronically adding colour before the image was aired. This made it very easy for technical crew to manipulate the colours of the image for whatever reason (like a logo revamp). This technique was also used on the clock and schools idents, which were also filmed in black and white by the same camera and had colour added later on. The camera would be set up looking at a bank of clocks, idents, globes and breakdown captions and could be <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> any of these idents. The black and blue mirror globe was recreated to introduce Life on Mars which itself is set in the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|At Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman {{reportedly}} interrupted The Who's {{performance to}} attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party. He grabbed a microphone and yelled, [...] "I {{think this is a}} pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison..." [...] Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted [...] "Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!" [...] and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair's imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the [...] "sanctity of the stage," [...] i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change, and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who's box set, Thirty Years of Maximum R (Disc 2, Track 20, [...] "Abbie Hoffman Incident").|$|E
