5|$|To {{encourage}} {{the creation of}} Rovering in the U.S., J. S. Wilson travelled from the UK to oversee a Wood Badge course in May 1936 at Schiff. Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge. After World WarII, Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a <b>test</b> <b>course</b> begun on July 31, 1948, at Schiff and the first standard course at Philmont Scout Ranch. As the national director of training, Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads, a tradition that has been discontinued in the U.K. Scout Association, however other countries still continue {{the use of the}} five Wood Badge Beads and are still worn by the National Volunteer Leader of Wood Badge Training of each country as well as by special decree of Gilwell Park today.|$|E
25|$|Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group {{was located}} in Fullerton, California. The {{facility}} was 3 million square feet and included manufacturing, laboratories, offices, and a Munson road <b>test</b> <b>course.</b> It designed developed and produced the Air Defense Systems that replaced the Semi Automatic Defense Ground Environment (SAGE) in the United States with the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) AN/FYQ-93 including NORAD with Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and provided defense systems and air traffic control systems around the world. These systems are massive and at its peak Ground Systems Group employed 15,000 people and generated revenue in excess of $1 billion per year. They were the largest revenue producer and with its massive systems engineering division coordinated the inclusion of products and systems from other Hughes Groups into the large system solutions.|$|E

She ran a personal best of 2:24.25 hours at the 2011 Berlin Marathon, which was only enough for fourth place behind Paula Radcliffe in a quick field. At the Great Ethiopian Run in November she came third behind fellow marathoner Tiki Gelana. A fast finish at the 2012 Tokyo Marathon saw her break the course record with a winning time of 2:25:28 hours.|$|E

At the same time, more software <b>testing</b> <b>courses</b> are developed to fulfill the training needs for {{software testing}} professionals in the workforce as well as computer science/software engineering students studying in universities. However, it is generally agreed that software testing is a difficult subject to be taught within the duration of a course. Through real life teaching experience in a university software <b>testing</b> <b>course,</b> we found that students can learn the details of software testing principles and attain the testing techniques more effectively by including a practical project component in the software <b>testing</b> <b>course</b> curriculum, requiring them to plan, design, implement and test an automated software testing system...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{portion of}} Hughes' {{business}} interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one while filming Hell's Angels, one while setting the air speed {{record in the}} Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft {{at the airport in}} Glendale, CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of [...] over his <b>test</b> <b>course</b> near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reached 362mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of 9 hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was [...]|$|E

50|$|The NTPS {{grew out}} of a {{successful}} series of introductory flight <b>test</b> <b>courses</b> taught for military test organizations in the United States and Canada. Using an instrumented De Havilland Dove (DH-104), introductory, two-week performance and flying qualities flight <b>test</b> <b>courses</b> were taught for Edwards AFB, California; Patuxent River NAS, Maryland; Eglin AFB, Florida; the Naval Postgraduate School, California; Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio; and the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, CFB Cold Lake, Canada. The success of these courses led to opportunities to teach broader content flight <b>test</b> <b>courses</b> abroad. The school was formally established as a not-for-profit educational institute in the state of California in April 1981. The initial years of the school consisted of teaching introductory courses within the United States, mainly for military organizations, and teaching longer courses abroad (in Israel, Taiwan, Brazil and South Africa) using customer aircraft. By 1986, {{the decision was made to}} construct a large hangar and classroom complex in Mojave, California. Over the ensuing years more flight test training was done in Mojave with a growing fleet of aircraft, rather than at customer locations. Today the school trains 20-25 students in year-long courses with approximately 200 students attending one of several short courses each year.|$|R
