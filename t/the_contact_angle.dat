The very large value of <b>the</b> effective <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> leads to increased optical {{noise in the}} drop profile near the solid–liquid free surface and the progressive failure of simple geometric approximations. We demonstrate a systematic approach to determining <b>the</b> effective <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of drops on super-repellent surfaces. We use a perturbation solution of the Bashforth–Adams equation to estimate <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> of sessile drops of water, ethylene glycol, and diiodomethane on an omniphobic surface using direct measurements of the maximum drop width and height.

5|$|Another {{special case}} is where <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° {{occurs when the}} liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E

Surfactants are absorbed onto the liquid–vapor, solid–liquid, and solid–vapor interfaces, which modify the wetting behavior of hydrophobic materials {{to reduce the}} free energy. When surfactants are absorbed onto a hydrophobic surface, the polar head groups face into the solution with the tail pointing outward.
