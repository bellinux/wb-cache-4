60|$|To discuss, almost even to describe, {{the course}} of his policy and {{proceedings}} in the matter of Armenia, would bring us into a mixed controversy affecting statesmen now living, who played an unexpected part, and that controversy may well stand over for another, and let us hope a very distant, day. Whether we had a right to interfere single-handed; whether we were bound as a duty to interfere under the Cyprus Convention; whether our intervention would provoke hostilities on the part of other Powers and even kindle a general conflagration in Europe; whether our severance of diplomatic relations with the Sultan or our withdrawal from the concert of Europe would do any good; what possible form armed intervention could <b>take—all</b> these are questions on which both liberals and tories vehemently differed from one another then, and will vehemently differ again. Mr. Gladstone was bold and firm in his replies. As to the idea, he said, that all independent action on the part of this great country was to be made chargeable for producing war in Europe, “that is in my opinion a mistake almost more deplorable than almost any committed in the history of diplomacy.” We had a right under the convention. We had a duty under the responsibilities incurred at Paris in 1856, at Berlin in 1878. The upshot of his arguments at Liverpool was that we should break off relations with the Sultan; that we should undertake not to turn hostilities to our private advantage; that we should limit our proceedings to the suppression of mischief in its aggravated form; and if Europe threatened us with war it might be necessary to recede, as France had receded under parallel circumstances from her individual policy on the eastern question in 1840,—receded without loss either of honour or power, believing that she had been right and wise and others wrong and unwise.|$|E

5000|$|Infection with cereal cyst {{nematode}} {{is associated with}} a reduction in grain yield which may be of significant proportions. Thresholds of harmfulness depend on the population density of the nematode and differ among various cultivars and varieties. The weather conditions and soil types are also an important factor, with infections being increased in damp, warm growing seasons. The symptoms of infection include stunting and yellowing of the visible parts of the plant which may give the crop an uneven appearance. The presence of the disease can be established by inspecting the root system of plants and looking for abnormal development. The roots of infested plants develop a tangle of branches and swellings which are white when young but turn dark brown with age. It is the seedlings of cereals that are most readily infected with this nematode and damaged roots are often invaded by soil-borne pathogens such as root and crown rots. [...] When nematode populations are high, significant losses in yield can occur.

40|$|<b>Take-all</b> disease, {{caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is the most devastating root disease of wheat around the world. Typical <b>take-all</b> {{symptoms}} show as black necrotic lesions on the roots and when severe can cause premature ripening and stunting of the wheat crop, resulting in poor grain quality and yield loss. Both cultural and chemical control methods are moderately successful at controlling <b>take-all</b> but plant material that would be useful for <b>take-all</b> control via a genetic approach has not been identified in the UK or elsewhere. The main aim of this project was to identify resistance to <b>take-all</b> within wheat (Triticum spp.). This study explored a new phenomenon in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) which restricts <b>take-all</b> inoculum build-up (TAB) in the soil during a first wheat crop and also explored tissue based resistance to <b>take-all</b> in hexaploid wheat and a related diploid wheat species, Triticum monococcum. Forty-nine elite wheat varieties were evaluated {{for their ability to}} build-up <b>take-all</b> inoculum in first wheat field trials using a soil core bioassay method, and pedigree and molecular marker analyses were carried out to investigate the genetic sources of the TAB trait. The effect of a low or high TAB first wheat variety on <b>take-all</b> disease and yield in a following second wheat crop was evaluated in crop rotation field trials. This work demonstrated that there are significant differences between current elite wheat varieties screened for the TAB trait and that there are probably multiple genetic sources of the trait. <b>Take-all</b> disease was lower and yields generally higher in a second wheat crop after a low TAB first wheat. The susceptibility of fifty elite hexaploid wheat varieties and thirty-four T. monococcum accessions to <b>take-all</b> was evaluated in third wheat field trials.

40|$|Organic {{management}} of soils {{is generally considered}} to reduce the incidence and severity of plant diseases caused by soil-borne pathogens. In this study, <b>take-all</b> severity on roots of barley and wheat, caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, was significantly lower in organically-managed than in conventionally-managed soils. This effect was more pronounced on roots of barley and wheat plants grown in a sandy soil compared to a loamy organically-managed soil. Fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and in particular phlD+ pseudomonads, key factors in the <b>take-all</b> decline phenomenon, were represented at lower population densities in organically-managed soils compared to conventionally-managed soils. Furthermore, organic management adversely affected the initial establishment of introduced phlD+ P. fluorescens strain Pf 32 -gfp, but not its survival. In spite of its equal survival rate in organically- and conventionally-managed soils, the efficacy of biocontrol of <b>take-all</b> disease by introduced strain Pf 32 -gfp was significantly stronger in conventionally-managed soils than in organically-managed soils.

The herbicides also reduced the incidence of 'whiteheads' associated with <b>take-all</b> injury. In additional evaluations, mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb did not affect severity of disease on the roots, but whiteheads again were reduced. Diclofop-methyl applied at 1. 12 kg ai/ha in early January often reduced the severity of <b>take-all</b> disease on seminal and crown roots. Higher rates of this herbicide, however, occasionally increased disease severity. The number of seminal roots produced by plants treated with diclofop-methyl often depended upon both application rate {{and the level of}} <b>take-all</b> stress. Crown root and tiller production were stimulated by diclofop-methyl. Low rates of difenzoquat, dinoseb, and mecoprop often increased tillering as well. The responses of the wheat plant to all four herbicides generally were greatest in plots with <b>take-all</b> disease. Fresh weights of individual tillers generally were reduced in response to herbicide application. Stimulations of tillering in diseased plots treated with diclofop-methyl progressively declined when applications were delayed after early January. Grain yields were greater in diseased plots treated with mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb than in the untreated check in 1982. Grain yield was either reduced or unaffected by diclofopmethyl, regardless of the level of <b>take-all</b> disease present. Herbicides did not affect grain yield in 1983.

40|$|Gaeumannomyces tritici is a soil-borne, highly destructive, wheat root pathogen, causing <b>take-all</b> disease.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. <b>Take-all</b> is {{the name}} given to the disease caused by a soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) von Arx and Olivier var. tritici Walker (Ggt), an ascomycete of the family Magnaportheaceae (Cook, 2003). This fungus is an {{aggressive}} soil-borne pathogen causing root rot of wheat (primary host), barley and rye crops (secondary host). The flowering, seedling, and vegetative growth stages can {{be affected by the}} infection of the whole plant, leaves, roots, and stems. Infections of roots result in losses in crop yield and quality primarily due to a lowering in nutrient uptake. <b>Take-all</b> is most common in regions where wheat is cultivated without adequate crop rotation. Crop rotation allows time between the planting dates of susceptible crops, which causes a decrease in the inoculum potential of soilborne plant pathogens to levels below an economic threshold by resident antagonistic soil microbial communities. Soilborne disease suppressiveness is an inherent characteristic of the physical, chemical, and/or biological structure of a particular soil which might be induced by agricultural practices and activities such as the cultivation of crops, or the addition of organisms or nutritional amendments, causing a change in the microfloral environment. Disturbances of soil ecosystems that impact on the normal functioning of microbial communities are potentially detrimental to soil formation, energy transfers, nutrient cycling, and long-term stability. In this regard, an overview of soil properties and processes indicated that the use of microbiological and biochemical soil properties, such as microbial biomass, the analysis of microbial functional diversity and microbial structural diversity by the quantification of community level physiological profiles and signature lipid biomarkers are useful as indicators of soil ecological stress or restoration properties because they are more responsive to small changes than physical and chemical characteristics. In this study, the relationship between physico-chemical characteristics, and different biological indicators of soil quality of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral with respect to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat as caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), were investigated using various techniques. The effect of crop rotation on the functional and structural diversity of soils conducive to <b>take-all</b> disease was also investigated. Through the integration of quantitative and qualitative biological data as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of the various soils, the functional and structural diversity of microbial IV communities in the soils during different stadia of <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat were characterised. All results were evaluated statistically and the predominant physical and chemical characteristics that influenced the microbiological and biochemical properties of the agricultural soils during different stadia of <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat were identified using multivariate analyses. Although no significant difference @ > 0. 05) could be observed between the various soils using conventional microbiological enumeration techniques, the incidence of Gliocladium spp. in suppressive soils was increased. Significant differences @ < 0. 05) were observed between agricultural soils during different stadia of <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat. Although no clear distinction could be made between soils suppressive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, soils suppressive and conducive to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat differed substantially in their community level physiological profiles (CLPPs). Soils suppressive / neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carboxylic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, while conducive soils were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carbohydrates. Shifts in the functional diversity of the associated microbial communities were possibly caused by the presence of Ggt and associated antagonistic fungal and bacterial populations in the various soils. It was evident that the relationships amongst the functionality of the microbial communities within the various soils had undergone changes through the different stages of development of <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, thus implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities. Diversity indices were calculated as Shannon's diversity index (H') and substrate equitability (J) and were overall within the higher diversity range of 3. 6 and 0. 8, respectively, indicating the achievement of very high substrate diversity values in the various soils. A substantial percentage of the carbon sources were utilised, which contributed to the very high Shannon-Weaver substrate utilisation indices. Obtained substrate evenness (equitability) (J) indices indicated an existing high functional diversity. The functional diversity as observed during crop rotation, differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from each other, implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities, which could possibly be ascribed to the excretion of root exudates by sunflowers and soybeans. Using the Sorenson's index, a clear distinction could be made between the degrees of substrate utilisation between microbial populations in soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, as well as during crop rotation. Furthermore, the various soils could also be differentiated {{on the basis of the}} microbial community structure as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat. Soils conducive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat were characterised by high concentrations of manganese, as well as elevated concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids, terminally branched saturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids which were indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and micro eukaryotes (primarily fungi), respectively. These soils were also characterised by low concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as low soil pH. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat was characterised by the elevated levels of estimated of biomass and elevated concentrations of normal saturated fatty acids, which is ubiquitous to micro-organisms. The concentration of normal saturated fatty acids in suppressive soils is indicative of a low structural diversity. This soil was also characterised by high concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as elevated soil pH. The relationship between PLFAs and agricultural soils was investigated using principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and discriminant analysis (DA). Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the major phospholipid fatty acid groups indicated that the structural diversity differed significantly between soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. The results indicate that the microbial community functionality as well as the microbial community structure was significantly influenced by the presence of <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, and that the characterisation of microbial functional and structural diversity by analysis of community level physiological profiles and phospholipid fatty acid analysis, respectively, could be successfully used as an assessment criteria for the evaluation of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease of wheat, as well as in crop rotation systems. This methodology might be of significant value in assisting in the management and evaluation of agricultural soils subject to the prevalence of other soilborne diseases. Master...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Response from {{nitrogen}} and chloride fertilization {{was measured in}} field experiments on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Em. Thell. var. 'Stephens' and 'Yamhill') grown in western Oregon in an environment {{with a range of}} susceptibility to <b>take-all</b> root rot (Gaumannomyces graminis var. tritici Walker). Cropping sequences and expected disease severity considered in the study were: first year wheat after clover (low risk of severe <b>take-all</b> root rot: Nixon I experiment), second year wheat with high disease infection in the previous crop (high risk of severe <b>take-all</b> root rot: Keyt II experiment), second year wheat with low disease infection in the previous crop (moderate risk of severe <b>take-all</b> root rot: Nixon II and Coon experiment), third year wheat (high risk of severe <b>take-all</b> root rot: Jones experiment), fifth year wheat (high risk of severe <b>take-all</b> root rot: Keyt II experiment), and eighteenth year wheat (<b>take-all</b> decline established: the pathogen is present in the soil but does not cause damage, Evers experiment). Nitrogen treatments were applied at 0, 67, 134, and 202 kg/ha in all experiments where wheat followed wheat and at 0, 45, 90, and 134 kg/ha in the experiment where wheat followed clover. Chloride treatments were applied at 0, 45, and 90 kg/ha in all experiments and a rate of 134 kg C 1 /ha was also used on the Jones experiment. Nitrogen was predominantly supplied from urea while ammonium chloride supplied chloride and ammonium sulfate supplied the crop requirement for sulfur (about 20 kg/ha). Fertilizers were top-dressed in split application with chloride and sulfur containing fertilizers applied first (February) and urea applied later (March) in all experiments but those conducted in the Nixon farm where a single fertilizer was applied in March. Crop response was measured through the effects of N and c 1 treatments on dry matter production, plant nitrogen content, plant nitrogen uptake and plant percent nitrogen recovery, as well as grain yield, yield components, grain nitrogen content, grain protein content, grain nitrogen uptake, and grain percent nitrogen recovery. The results of the study strongly indicated that <b>take-all</b> root rot was only a problem in the Jones, Keyt I, and Keyt II experiments and was most severe in third year wheat (Jones experiment). This also was the only experiment with significant (p = 0. 05) response from rates of 202 kg N/ha. Nitrogen fertilization was the main factor that greatly influenced the levels of the variables studied while chloride fertilization generally did not have a significant (p = 0. 05) influence. 134 kg N/ha was generally the rate accounting for the best levels of each variable studied in all experiments except in the Jones experiment as precised earlier. Crop response was also affected by a relatively long 'dry' period (April 20 th to June 20 th), particularly in the experiment where <b>take-all</b> root rot was a problem. Levels of the variables studied accounted for by the optimum rates of N were consistently higher in the experiments where <b>take-all</b> root rot was not a problem than where it was a problem by the following amounts: dry matter yields- 17...|$|E
40|$|Manganese {{chemistry}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the etiology of <b>take-all</b> root, crown, and stem rot of wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt). The purpose of this field and growth chamber research was to establish the impact of rhizosphere organisms and cultural practices on Mn availability, and verify the role of Mn in <b>take-all.</b> This research confirmed the positive correlation of Mn oxidation as a virulence factor of Ggt, and identified temperature as a significant interactive factor with both Mn oxidation and virulence. Among the rhizophere microbes interacting with <b>take-all,</b> Bacillus cereus was found to inhibit Mn oxidation by Ggt, reduce <b>take-all,</b> and increase wheat yield. In contrast, Agrobacterium radiobacter, a strong Mn oxidizer, reduced Mn uptake by wheat and increased <b>take-all.</b> These important findings explain differences reported by researchers from different wheat production areas. However, oxidation-reduction reactions with other organisms was not consistently correlated with an effect on <b>take-all.</b> ^ Light and electron microscopy evaluation, combined with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, confirmed the presence of Mn oxides on and near fungal mycelium and infection structures. The extra-cellular Mn-oxidative factor produced by Ggt oxidized Mn in advance of the mycelium. Barrier type plant defense reactions were not observed following oxidation of Mn in the infection court. In contrast, membrane-bound Mn oxidation limited to the lobed hyphopodia and adjacent infection structures of the closely related G. graminis var. graminis (Ggg), facilitated epiphytic growth, but limited penetration of Ggg to epidermal cortical tissues. This may explain Ggg 2 ̆ 7 s failure to induce extensive necrosis or vascular occlusion characteristic of <b>take-all.</b> ^ Micro-X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (XANES), a new high energy X-ray fluorescence technique, was used to establish that direct oxidation of Mn occurred during Ggt pathogenesis on wheat roots. Manganese accumulated inside the root as a result of Ggt-catalyzed mineralization. These findings provide new and exciting direct evidence that Ggt oxidizes Mn in the rhizosphere of wheat seedlings, and provides the ground work for future in-situ research using this powerful technique to study microbial interactions in the rhizosphere involved in micronutrient availability, disease suppression, and biological control. ...|$|E
40|$|One {{experiment}} was initiated {{in the fall}} of 1991 to evaluate the effect of chloride (Cl) fertilizers on the suppression of <b>take-all</b> disease (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici Walker) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Preplant and topdress rates of potassium chloride (KCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl 2) (0, 34, 67 and 101 kg Cl haÿ 1) were applied each year. In 1995, plots were split in half whereby one half received 2. 24 Mg of 76 % ECCE lime haÿ 1 to elevate the pH and potentially increase dis-ease incidence. Wheat grain yield was not affected by lime applications in any year (1995 – 1999). Plots exhibited visual symptoms of <b>take-all</b> in almost all years, however, grain yields increased in only two of eight years by the application of CaCl 2 and KCl.

40|$|<b>Take-all,</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is the most {{important}} root disease of wheat worldwide. Many years of intensive research, reflected by the large volume of literature on <b>take-all,</b> has led to a considerable degree of understanding of many aspects of the disease. However, effective and economic control of the disease remains difficult. The application of molecular techniques to study G. graminis and related fungi has resulted in some significant advances, particularly in the development of improved methods for identification and in elucidating the role of the enzyme avenacinase as a pathogenicity determinant in the closely related oat <b>take-all</b> fungus (G. graminis var. avenae).

40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 - 79 (NRRL B- 15132) and its rifampin-resistant {{derivative}} 2 - 79 RN 10 are suppressive to <b>take-all,</b> a major root {{disease of}} wheat caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. Strain 2 - 79 produces the antibiotic phenazine- 1 -carboxylate, which {{is active in}} vitro against G. graminis var. tritici and other fungal root pathogens. Mutants defective in phenazine synthesis (Phz-) were generated by Tn 5 insertion and then compared with the parental strain to determine {{the importance of the}} antibiotic in <b>take-all</b> suppression on wheat roots. Six independent, prototrophic Phz- mutants were noninhibitory to G. graminis var. tritici in vitro and provided significantly less control of <b>take-all</b> than strain 2 - 79 on wheat seedlings. Antibiotic synthesis, fungal inhibition in vitro, and suppression of <b>take-all</b> on wheat were coordinately restored in two mutants complemented with cloned DNA from a 2 - 79 genomic library. These mutants contained Tn 5 insertions in adjacent EcoRI fragments in the 2 - 79 genome, and the restriction maps of the region flanking the insertions and the complementary DNA were colinear.

40|$|A {{mitochondrial}} ribosomal DNA probe (pEG 34) {{that distinguishes}} two main {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) types of isolate of the <b>take-all</b> fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici {{was used to}} compare isolates from different host species. RFLP analysis confirmed that one type (designated T 2), unlike the other type (T 1), was associated more with barley than with triticale or wheat. RFLP analysis and other methods were also used to compare isolates of the <b>take-all</b> fungus from wheat seedlings grown in soil from first and second wheat crops. from wheat crops grown in longer sequences, and from oat crops grown as breaks from susceptible cereals. These provided samples from different stages of disease build up and decline in the <b>take-all</b> epidemic. Differences in frequencies of some characteristics were found at conventional significance levels (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) : in a cereal sequence experiment at Rothamsted, U. K., isolates containing dsRNA were less frequent in T 2 isolates than T 1 isolates except in second wheats; perithecia were produced more abundantly on roots of wheat seedlings inoculated with T 1 isolates than with T 2 isolates, regardless of their origin. A weaker association (P less than or equal to 0. 1) was also found: T 2 isolates were often more frequent from second wheat crops, before <b>take-all</b> peaked in wheat sequences, than from other wheat crops or oats break crops. Collectively, the findings add only modest support to the controversial hypothesis that changes in the population of the <b>take-all</b> fungus occur during repeated cropping of wheat. The limitations of traditional sampling and assessment methods in such studies are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
