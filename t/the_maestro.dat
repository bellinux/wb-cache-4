5|$|Duke Vincenzo was keen to {{establish}} his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, <b>the</b> <b>maestro</b> di capella at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister the singer Madama Europa, and the tenor Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was <b>the</b> <b>maestro</b> di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Boccioni {{published}} his book, Pittura, scultura futuriste (Futurist Painting and Sculpture), which caused a rift {{between himself and}} some of his Futurist comrades.

With Horizontal Volumes in 1915 and the Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of <b>the</b> <b>maestro</b> who purchased his first Futurist work, The City Rises.|$|E

The same stroke was adapted by his successor Dhanraj Pillay, who was an ardent fan of <b>the</b> <b>maestro.</b> Earlier the stroke or technique did not exist in a field hockey player's repertoire or in the game's coaching manual.|$|E
