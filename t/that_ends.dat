50|$|In Hindi, nouns have gender—they {{are either}} {{masculine}} or feminine. Both {{masculine and feminine}} nouns are divided further into two categories. For masculine nouns, there are nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a and nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> in -a. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a are considered marked, while those that don't are unmarked. Similarly, for feminine nouns there are those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -i {{and those that do}} not. All feminine nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> in the vowel -i are unmarked. These all have different declension (or inflectional morphology based on their gender, plurality, and case).|$|R
50|$|The game {{started off}} with a long Oklahoma drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> with a Samaje Perine 1 yard {{touchdown}} that put the Sooners up 7-0.

50|$|Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -ius, {{instead of}} the {{expected}} -ie end with -ī. Thus, Julius becomes Julī and filius becomes filī. The shortening does not shift the accent so the vocative of Vergilius is Vergilī, with accent on the second syllable {{even though it is}} short. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -aius and -eius have vocatives <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -aī or -eī even though the i in the nominative is consonantal.|$|R

50|$|Kannada {{has four}} declensions, {{or groups of}} case-terminations. The first declension {{includes}} all masculine and feminine nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in 'ಅ'; the second declension includes all neuter nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in 'ಅ'; the third declension includes all nouns of all genders <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in 'ಇ', 'ಈ', 'ಎ', 'ಏ', or 'ಐ'; the fourth declension includes all nouns of all genders <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in 'ಉ', ಊ', 'ಋ', 'ೠ', 'ಓ', or 'ಔ'.Below are the 'standard' case-terminations, which are suffixed to the plural number markers to create the full case-termination in the plural.

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout <b>that</b> <b>ends</b> in a {{moist and}} touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is weakly radioactive: {{all of its}} known {{isotopes}} are unstable. The {{most stable}} isotope of thorium, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.05billionyears, or {{about the age of}} the universe; it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the thorium series <b>that</b> <b>ends</b> at stable 208Pb. Thorium and uranium are the only two radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. It is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals.|$|E

5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont route number <b>that</b> <b>ends</b> in Larrabees Point. The already existing NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway has remained the same since that date.|$|E

5000|$|In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is {{expressed}} by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun, much {{like in the}} Scandinavian languages or Romanian (indefinite: човек, person; definite: човекът, [...] "the person") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: добър човек, a good person; definite: добрият човек, [...] "the good person"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the nouns ending in the singular. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in a consonant and are masculine use -ът/-ят, when they are grammatical subjects, and -а/-я elsewhere. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -а/-я (most of which are feminine, too) use -та. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -е/-о use -то.|$|R

5|$|Since 1725, the iodine-rich seawaters of Póvoa, {{due to the}} {{peculiar}} high quantities of seaweed <b>that</b> <b>ends</b> up in Póvoa beaches from the sheltered bay to Cape Santo André, brought by ocean currents, lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea-baths in there, searching cures for skin and bone problems. Still in the 18th century, other people went to Póvoa with the same concerns. In the 19th century, the town became popular as a summer destination for the wealthy of Entre-Douro-e-Minho province and Portuguese Brazilians, due to its large sandy beaches {{and the development of}} theaters, hotels and casinos. It then became renowned for its refined literary culture, artistic patronage in music and theater, and intellectual tertulia.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} oval, white and {{coarsely}} textured. All species normally lay {{at least two}} eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can {{be as high as}} 95 percent but, because of sibling competition or siblicide, in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent’s pouch and feed themselves. Sometimes before, or especially after, being fed, they may seem to have a seizure <b>that</b> <b>ends</b> in falling unconscious; the reason is not clearly known.|$|E
50|$|Most {{feminine}} nouns end in -η -i, -α -a and -ος -os. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -i {{and many}} <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a {{stem from the}} ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural. The rest of those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a originate from the ancient third declension and have formed their nominative singular from the ancient accusative singular; those nouns keep the accent unchanged in genitive plural. The nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -os are identical to the respective masculine nouns. Finally, many feminine nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -η (-i) correspond to Ancient Greek nouns in -ις (-is), which are still used as learned forms in formal contexts. Their singular forms have been adapted {{to the rest of}} the feminine nouns, while their plural forms have retained the ancient pattern in -εις (-eis). The forms of the genitive singular -εως (-eos) are also found as a stylistic variant and they are fully acceptable, and in fact are more commonly used than the old-style nominative singular form.|$|R
