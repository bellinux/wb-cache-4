50|$|The acting {{principle}} {{behind the}} vapor degreaser process is that <b>the</b> <b>solvents</b> will dissolve <b>the</b> contaminants on the workpiece and remove them by dripping off the part. A basin of solvent {{is set up}} with a heating coil to bring <b>the</b> <b>solvent</b> to boil. As <b>the</b> <b>solvent</b> evaporates it rises to the fill-line in the chamber, above which is air with a much lower density than <b>the</b> <b>solvent.</b> This contains <b>the</b> vaporized <b>solvent</b> in a closed space where the workpiece is placed. <b>The</b> <b>solvent</b> condenses on <b>the</b> more frigid workpiece and <b>the</b> now liquid <b>solvent</b> dissolves <b>the</b> greases on the part. With the impurities contained in the liquid beads, <b>the</b> <b>solvent</b> runs off <b>the</b> part. Some systems are designed to capture and reclaim this <b>solvent,</b> making <b>the</b> process much more economical.|$|R
