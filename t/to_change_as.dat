5|$|After the war, Beth Elohim allowed {{women to}} become full members, {{granting}} them full voting privileges and {{allowing them to}} hold office. The congregation subsequently elected Jeanette Marks as a trustee. At this time {{the origins of the}} membership began <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> Jews of Eastern European descent started joining the congregation.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} focus began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> {{the country}} {{sank into the}} worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of December 13, 1977, a {{dormitory}} fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, the demographics of the student body continued <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.|$|E
5|$|The continual {{congestion}} and requirements for closures and refurbishments are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> the Blackwall Tunnel {{remains the only}} major road crossing of the Thames in east London for the short-term future. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge, a new crossing between the Woolwich Ferry and the Dartford Crossing, was cancelled by Boris Johnson when he replaced Livingstone as mayor in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The first {{places to}} reach grid parity were {{those with high}} {{traditional}} electricity prices {{and high levels of}} solar radiation. Currently, more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> different regions achieve grid parity. This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E

5|$|When Barnhart {{revised the}} family Lentibulariaceae in 1916, he {{recognized}} six {{species in the}} section Orcheosanthus, admitting however that this number was likely <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> others studied the section in the future. Sprague in 1928 proposed that the species joined by Hemsley were probably distinct, but that they were likely so interrelated that distinguishing between them would require observing characteristics that were usually or always indistinct in dried specimens. Sprague recognized eight species in the section: P. moranensis H.B.K, P. caudata Schltdl., P. oblongiloba, P. flos-mulionis, P. bakeriana, a P. moranensis-like P. rosei described by Watson in 1911, and the very distinct P. gypsicola.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> <b>as</b> many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadronâ€™s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> <b>As</b> they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E
5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} between the two countries began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>as</b> a result of the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Russia no longer saw itself strong enough to sustain its aspirations of superpower status. Consequently, Russia began to attach more significance to geo-economics rather than geo-politics in its relations with CIS neighbours. This development accelerated during Vladimir Putin's presidency, when Russian foreign policy became more pragmatic and economised.|$|E
