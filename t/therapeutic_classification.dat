40|$|Awareness of {{the safety}} of {{medication}} use has not been investigated {{from the perspective of}} medication users. This study focused on medical experts ’ opinions concerning the safety of using transdermal patches with printed <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> marks. We conducted a questionnaire study of cardiac transdermal patch users, including doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. In addition to traditional statistical analyses, we developed a pseudo-distance measure and applied an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to questionnaire data. Medical experts supported the validity of transdermal patches and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> mark design. Opinions regarding displays on labels differed by occupation. Following the opinion of pharmacists and nurses, who deal directly with the medications, we conclude that the display of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> marks and product names should be promoted...|$|E
40|$|It can {{be argued}} that with several players {{marketing}} a large number of brands, the pharmaceutical market in India is competitive. However, the pharmaceutical market should not be studied as a single market but, as a sum total {{of a large number of}} individual sub-markets. This paper examines the methodological issues with respect to defining the relevant market involved in studying concentration in the pharmaceutical market in India. Further, we have examined whether the Indian pharmaceutical market is competitive. Indian pharmaceutical market was studied using PharmaTrac, the sales audit data from AIOCD-AWACS, that organises formulations into 5 levels of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> based on the EphMRA system. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) was used as the indicator of market concentration. We calculated HHI for the entire pharmaceutical market studied as a single market as well as at the five different levels of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification.</b> Whereas the entire pharmaceutical market taken together as a single market displayed low concentration (HHI = 226. 63), it was observed that if each formulation is defined as an individual sub-market, about 69 percent of the total market in terms of market value displayed at least moderate concentration. Market should be defined taking into account the ease of substitutability. Since, patients cannot themselves substitute the formulation prescribed by the doctor with another formulation with the same indication and therapeutic effect, owing to information asymmetry, it is appropriate to study market concentration at the narrower levels of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, 23 new cancer {{treatment}} drugs have been introduced, many have brought major benefits to patient care, whilst others have maintained clinical benefits with reduced toxicity. In this article, the historical trends in drug numbers, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification,</b> and treatment costs have been reviewed. Drugs are classified {{by years of}} introduction, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification,</b> and an assessment of relative treatment cost using a contemporary ‘standard’ treatment compared with the relevant UK GDP per capita. Prior to 1960, there were 5 cancer drugs available, 2 new drugs were introduced in the 1960 s, 18 in the 1970 s, 14 in the 1980 s, 24 in the 1990 s, and 23 in the past decade. Prior to 1975, all the cancer treatments were classical cytotoxic agents. Since then, there have been 17 hormonal agents, 6 monoclonal antibodies, and 7 targeted therapies. The number of new classical cytotoxic drugs has declined dramatically with only one new agent in the past decade. The new drugs have become increasingly expensive relative to average GDP, with an average standard course of treatment with a new non-hormonal agent costing 34 % of per capita GDP in 1995 – 1999, 53 % in 2000 – 2004, and 67 % in 2005 – 2009. In contrast, the cost of new hormonal agents introduced has remained at lower levels, with 6 -month treatment with Degarelix, the newest hormonal agent, costing 3. 8 % of per capita GDP in 2009.

40|$|Background:Lung cancer (LC) is the {{dominant}} cause of death by cancer in the world, being responsible {{for more than a}} million deaths annually. It is a highly lethal common tumor that is frequently diagnosed in advanced stages for which effective alternative therapeutics do not exist. In view of this, there is an urgent need to improve the diagnostic, prognostic, and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> systems, currently based on clinicopathological criteria that do not adequately translate the enormous biologic complexity of this disease. Methods:The advent of the human genome sequencing project and the concurrent development of many genomic-based technologies have allowed scientists to explore the possibility of using expression profiles to identify homogenous tumor subtypes, new prognostic factors of human cancer, response to a particular treatment, etc. and thereby select the best possible therapies while decreasing the risk of toxicities for the patients. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to identify the complete catalog of genes that are altered in cancer and to discriminate tumors accurately {{on the basis of their}} genetic background. Results and Discussion:In this article, we present some of the works that has applied high-throughput technologies to LC research. In addition, we will give an overview of recent results in the field of LC genomics, with their effect on patient care, and discuss challenges and the potential future developments of this area...|$|E
40|$|Gene therapy, {{aimed at}} the {{correction}} of key pathologies being {{out of reach for}} conventional drugs, bears the potential to alter the treatment of cardiovascular diseases radically and thereby of heart failure. Heart failure gene therapy refers to a therapeutic system of targeted drug delivery to the heart that uses formulations of DNA and RNA, whose products determine the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> through their biological actions. Among resident cardiac cells, cardiomyocytes have been the therapeutic target of numerous attempts to regenerate systolic and diastolic performance, to reverse remodeling and restore electric stability and metabolism. Although the concept to intervene directly within the genetic and molecular foundation of cardiac cells is simple and elegant, the path to clinical reality has been arduous because of the challenge on delivery technologies and vectors, expression regulation, and complex mechanisms of action of therapeutic gene products. Nonetheless, since the first demonstration of in vivo gene transfer into myocardium, there have been a series of advancements that have driven the evolution of heart failure gene therapy from an experimental tool to the threshold of becoming a viable clinical option. The objective of this review is to discuss {{the current state of the}} art in the field and point out inevitable innovations on which the future evolution of heart failure gene therapy into an effective and safe clinical treatment relies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and {{basal-like}} breast cancers (BLBCs) {{are known}} as poor outcome subtypes {{with a lack of}} targeted therapy. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the difference of prognostic significance between TNBCs and BLBCs. In this study, we aimed to characterize the prognostic features of TNBCs, in view of BLBCs and quintuple-negative breast cancers (QNBC/ 5 NPs). Methods Using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical analysis, we categorized 951 primary breast cancers into four or five subtypes according to the expression of ER, PR, HER 2, and basal markers (CK 5 / 6, EGFR). Results The results of this study showed that both TNBCs and BLBCs were associated with high histological and/or nuclear grades. When the TNBCs are divided into two subtypes by the presence of basal markers, the clinicopathologic characteristics of TNBCs were mainly maintained in the BLBCs. The 5 -subgrouping was the better prediction model for both disease free and overall survival in breast cancers than the 4 -subgrouping. After multivariate analysis of TNBCs, the BLBCs did not have a worse prognosis than the QNBC/ 5 NPs. Interestingly, the patients with BLBCs showed significant adjuvant chemotherapy benefit. In addition, QNBC/ 5 NPs comprised about 6 ~ 8 % of breast cancers in publicly available breast cancer datasets Conclusion The QNBC/ 5 NP subtype is a worse prognostic subgroup of TNBCs, especially in higher stage and this result may be related to adjuvant chemotherapy benefit of BLBCs, calling for caution in the identification of subgroups of patients for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Antibiotic {{consumption}} in the primary care sector is often perceived as synonymous with {{consumption in}} general practice {{despite the fact that}} few countries stratify the primary care sector by providers’ medical specialty. We aimed to characterize and quantify antibiotic use in Danish general practice relative to the entire primary care sector. Methods: This was a registry-based study including all patients who redeemed an antibiotic prescription between July 2004 and June 2013 at a Danish community pharmacy. Antibiotic use was expressed as DDDs and treatments/ 1000 inhabitants/day (DIDs and TIDs, respectively) and assessed according to antibiotic spectrum (narrow versus broad) and their anatomical <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> codes in total as well as in six age groups. Results: The contribution of general practice to the entire antibiotic use in the primary care sector declined during the study period (TIDs, 79 %– 75 %; DIDs, 77 %– 73 %). Antibiotic use in general practice increased 8 % when expressed as DIDs, while a 9 % decrease was observed when expressed as TIDs. The use of broad-spectrum agents increased while narrow-spectrum agents decreased. The decline in antibiotic use was most prominent in children aged, 5 years, while elderly patients were increasingly prescribed antibiotics. Conclusions: Using the entire primary care sector as a proxy for general practice prescribing is imprecise. Antibiotic use in general practice is at a stable high level, but DID and TID analyses show different trends and both should be applied when detailing changes in antibiotic consumption. While children are prescribed fewer narrow-spectrum agents, the observed increase in the use of broad-spectrum agents is worrisome and should be addressed in future interventions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} drug utilization {{pattern in}} terms of defined daily dose along with pharmacoeconomic analysis in geriatric patients admitted in medical ward of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Retrospective medical record analysis was performed for indoor cases of the geriatric patients (age ≥ 65 years) admitted in medicine ward from January 2010 to December 2010 were analyzed for demographics, indications for admission, various systems involved, duration of hospital stay, various drugs prescribed, and adverse drug reaction. The drugs were categorized by anatomical <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> and defined daily dose was calculated. The World Health Organization prescribing indicators were assessed. Cost of the drugs was calculated to assess the economic burden. Results: Cardiovascular diseases were the common cause for admission. Antiplatelet drugs-B 01 AC (93 %), H 2 blockers-A 02 BA (77. 22 %), antiemetics-A 03 FA (67. 6 %), vasodilators-C 01 D (55 %), and hypolipidemic drugs-C 10 AA (52 %) were commonly utilized groups. Average number of drugs per patient was 9. 37 (95 % CI: 9. 09 - 9. 64). Average number of antimicrobials prescribed per patient was 0. 91 (95 % CI: 0. 82 - 0. 99). Cefotaxime was the commonly prescribed antimicrobial drug. Average cost of treatment was ₹ 540. 5 (95 % CI: ₹ 458. 0 - 623. 0). Patients shared 45 % of the economic burden for prescribed medicines. The average economic burden for drugs was significantly higher in expired than survived patients (₹ 749. 49 vs. 457. 59).

Sever had already reported three fiactures of the tibia! condyle in 1916, and had discussed them again in 1922.

The present paper is intended to review ’ these general principles and to add a “ <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> “. The basic mechanism for all fiactures of the lateral tibia! condy!e is an impaction of the condyle of the femur against the plateau of the tibia, as a hammer strikes an anvil. Many authors have pointed out that three main variations can be differentiated. In a series of forty cases, the authors have classified these three general types. Type I, the “crush fracture “, consists of all degrees of compi-ession of the lateral tibia! condyle with mild or extreme depression of the plateau. In Type II, or the “split fracture”, the condyle, instead! of being crushed, is split off w’it. h little, if any, dleplession.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop sustained release tablet of Nifedipine. The drug is a dihydropyridine derivative mainly indicated for the treatment of Hypertension. The drug belongs to the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> as calcium channel blocker and antianginal. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. The granules were evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index, and Hausner ratio. The tablets were subjected to thickness, hardness, friability, weight variations, and drug content by assay and in vitro dissolution studies. The granules showed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility index and drug content. All the tablet formulations showed acceptable pharmaceutical properties. The in-vitro drug release from Nifedipine sustained release tablet was carried out in 1. 2 N HCl, and 6. 8 pH phosphate buffer for 24 hrs. The optimized formulation F 3 showed the highest f 2 (similarity factor) (f 2 = 75. 5) value. The drug release from the developed formulation was independent of agitational intensity. The release rate was influenced by medium, the amount of rate controlling polymer. The similarity factor, f 2 was applied between the optimized formulation and the theoretical dissolution profile. The comparison of optimized formulation with marketed product gave a satisfactory release profile. The drug release data were plotted using various kinetic equations (Zero order, First order, Higuchi’s kinetics, Korsmeyer and Peppas kinetics and Hixson and Crowell kinetics) to evaluate the drug release mechanism and kinetics. The formulations were found to be stable for after 2 months of accelerated stability studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} the various patterns in drug prescribing in a non-Ministry of Health-affiliated primary healthcare centre model (Riyadh Kharj Military Hospital) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pharmacy {{records of the}} Riyadh Kharj Military Hospital was undertaken. A total of 4781 prescriptions archived {{over a period of}} 6 months (January-June 2001) were statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Number, types, therapeutic duration and distribution of drugs were evaluated. Age distribution and documentation adequacy were also reviewed and monitored. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>classification</b> of drugs was carried out according to the British National Formulary system. KEY FINDINGS: Of the total prescriptions, 47. 8 % were for male patients and 50. 1 % for females. Prescriptions for the paediatric population accounted for 19. 5 % whereas 13. 7 % of drugs were prescribed to the geriatric cohort. A mean of 2. 7 ± 1. 6 drugs were prescribed per patient. In multidrug prescriptions, 32. 3 % contained two drugs and 22. 1 % prescriptions had four drugs or more. Mono-drug prescriptions accounted for 21. 6 % of prescriptions. Paracetamol (13. 9 %) was the most commonly prescribed drug followed by multivitamins and cough syrups with 5. 0 and 3. 7 %, respectively. The most common therapeutic classes of drugs prescribed were analgesics, antipyretics, antihistamines, and vitamins and minerals, making up a third of all prescriptions. Dosage form, dose and routes of administration were not present in 21. 7, 8. 8 and 99. 6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy appears to be a problem in primary health care, which requires stricter pharmacovigilance and constant reviewing. We recommend the establishment of an efficient local prescribing policy through an effective practice-based Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee, training in prescribing to be introduced in medical schools and the lending of support to continuous education programmes targeting prescribing skills...|$|E

Methods: The data of 2, 442 registered patients for a 1 -year period were screened and analyzed concerning antibiotic and analgesic use as per standards of rational prescription. Results: Dentistry doctors prescribed antibiotics significantly {{more often than}} analgesics. Antibiotics were prescribed in 8. 11 % of all cases, while only 1. 35 % of total prescriptions were for analgesics. The total consumption of antibiotic drugs in the UDCCK was 4. 53 Defined Daily Doses [DDD]/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day, compared with only 0. 216 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day for analgesics. From a total number of 117 patients, 32 patients received combinations of two antibiotics.
