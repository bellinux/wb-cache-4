In this paper, a bilateral <b>transaction</b> <b>contract</b> model through a transaction matrix and line utility factors are used to evaluate cost of bilateral power contracts. The proposed method allocates the transaction costs over the participants/contracts proportional to the ratio of power flow caused by each participant/contract and the total power flows on a designated transmission line.

But few such systems address consistencies of transactional objects. In this thesis, I propose a contract-based transactional programming model toward more secure transactional softwares. In this general model, a validity contract specifies both requirements and effects for <b>transactions.</b> Validity <b>contracts</b> bring numerous benefits including reasoning about and verifying transactional programs, detecting and resolving transactional conflicts, automating object revalidation and easing program debugging. I introduce an ownership-based framework, namely AVID, derived from the general model, using object ownership as a mechanism for specifying and reasoning validity contracts. I have specified a formal type system and implemented a prototype type checker to support static checking. I also have built a transactional library framework AVID, based on existing Java DSTM 2 framework, for expressing <b>transactions</b> and validity <b>contracts.</b> Experimental results on a multi-core system show that contracts add little overheads to the original STM.
