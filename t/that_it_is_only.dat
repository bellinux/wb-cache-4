5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur {{naturally}} in Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia salina formerly occurred in England. Within Great Britain, C. diaphanus is restricted to areas with a deficit of precipitation against evapotranspiration between April and September. This means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> found frequently in southern England, with scattered records {{as far north as}} Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first {{described}} this species as Boletus torosus in 1835, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> distantly related to Boletus edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten it without ill-effects.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed out <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government {{had little interest in}} enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} upland defended sites, {{the economy of}} the tribe which {{inhabited}} Carningli was probably a pastoral one. The site is incredibly exposed, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite possible <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> seasonally inhabited.|$|R
50|$|In the 70s Flight Refuelling {{left the}} {{airfield}} and flying operations moved to Hurn. After <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> used by gliders and occasionally by light aircraft until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> officially closed on 30 September 1980.|$|R

25|$|We believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> {{attacks of}} such a nature that bring it home to people in Britain and the British establishment.

25|$|The Melians {{argue that}} it would be shameful and cowardly of them to submit without a fight. The Athenians counter <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> shameful to submit to an {{opponent}} whom one has a reasonable chance of defeating. There is no shame in submitting to an overwhelmingly superior opponent like Athens.|$|E
25|$|One sees {{immediately}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> feasible {{when the}} numeral to be halved does not contains an a (or, if the numeral is extended, an odd number of as). In other words, an abbreviated numeral is odd if it contains an a {{and even if}} it does not.|$|E

25|$|The other Christchurch newspaper, The Star, {{itself a}} {{supporter}} of the Liberal Government, strongly disagreed with this stance and argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> natural for the Liberal Party to find another candidate before issuing the writ.|$|R

25|$|However, further {{work done}} in 2015 by Sutirtha Bagchia and Jan Svejnar {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> inequality caused by corruption and cronyism that harms growth.

25|$|The common view of riba (usury) among {{classical}} jurists of Islamic law {{and economics}} during the Islamic Golden Age was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> riba and therefore unlawful to apply interest to money exnatura sua—exclusively gold and silver currencies—but {{that it is not}} riba and is therefore acceptable to apply interest to fiat money—currencies made up of other materials such as paper or base metals—to an extent.|$|E
25|$|He {{was named}} Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904 {{and also in}} 1921, making him one of two to have {{received}} the honour twice (the usual practice is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> won once: the other is Jack Hobbs). The second award marked his retirement as a county player after the 1920 season, in which he captained Middlesex to the County Championship title.|$|E
25|$|Another {{debatable}} {{point is}} Thietmar's claim that Mieszko subordinated {{himself to the}} King. Most historians believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a matter of recognition of Otto's royal authority. Some suggest that a fealty relationship could in fact be involved.|$|R

25|$|Salvinorin A {{is capable}} of {{inhibiting}} excess intestinal motility (e.g. diarrhea), through its potent k-opioid-activating effects. The mechanism of action for salvinorinA on ileal tissue {{has been described as}} 'prejunctional', as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions, but not those of exogenous acetylcholine. A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction-reducing properties of ingested salvinorinA on gut tissue is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> pharmacologically active on inflamed and not normal tissue, thus reducing possible side-effects.|$|E

25|$|Freud, like Josef Breuer, {{found the}} {{hypothesis}} that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas {{to be not only}} warranted, but given in observation. Disagreement between them arose when they attempted to give causal explanations of their data: Breuer favored a hypothesis of hypnoid states, while Freud postulated the mechanism of defense. Richard Wollheim comments that given the close correspondence between hysteria and the results of hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> when repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, joint-control {{training}} was applied when teaching manded selection responses {{to children with}} autism.

The results showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> after object-word naming was trained under joint control that the symmetrical performance of manded selection responses appeared with no additional training. Four non-vocal children with autism participated in the second experiment, two males (ages six and seven), and two females (ages twelve and thirteen). These results also showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> after the joint tact/self-mimetic/sequelic control training that the symmetrical performance of manded selection responses appeared with no additional training...|$|R
