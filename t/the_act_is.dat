5|$|The Act {{continues}} {{to have a significant}} impact in English law, as its precedents serve to provide a definition of obscenity that is used in other legal contexts. For instance, anything deemed likely to contravene <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> prohibited from videos awarded an R18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification.

5|$|The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act {{was passed}} on 15 June 2001 and took effect on 1 July 2002, {{replacing}} various regulations. The act {{was created to}} secure a continuous, nearly untouched natural environment on Svalbard, particularly regarding wilderness, landscape, flora, fauna and cultural heritage. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> enacted by the Ministry of the Environment, the Climate and Pollution Agency, the governor, the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Directorate for Nature Management. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> supplemented by various regulations. Specific issues addressed in the act include the protection of plants and all remains of all human activity up to 1945. It imposes limitations on traffic in permitted areas, particularly motorized vehicles, but allows locals to operate snowscooters in more areas than tourists. Two-thirds of Svalbard is protected through national parks and nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from the position that <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, {{even if they are}} young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> {{that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing {{to the collapse of}} almost all industry codes.|$|E

5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5|$|Development in Canberra {{has been}} closely {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>is</b> held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>is</b> held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E
5|$|The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B.

Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E
50|$|Smith v. Doe {{questioned}} {{the constitutionality of}} <b>the</b> <b>act's</b> retroactive requirements.

5|$|When Singapore {{joined the}} Federation of Malaya in 1963, the Malayan ISA was {{extended}} to Singapore. The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The current version of <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition.

5|$|Several Land Reform Acts were enacted {{to provide}} {{ownership}} rights to poor farmers. Up to September 2001, more than 20,000,000 acres (80,000km²) of land had been distributed to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the landless poor. The thrust of banking policy in India {{has been to}} improve banking facilities in the rural areas. The Minimum Wages Act of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for employees engaged in various employments. The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 provides for the better protection of consumers. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> intended to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the consumers' grievances, award relief and compensation wherever appropriate to the consumer. The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, provides for equal pay for equal work {{for both men and}} women.

Upon the Hanoverian {{succession}} in 1714 and the subsequent supremacy of the Whig party, <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> repealed by <b>the</b> Religious Worship <b>Act</b> 1718.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> criticised for poorly {{translating}} [...] "new {{standards of}} behaviour" [...] into an effective legal document.

5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>is</b> not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
