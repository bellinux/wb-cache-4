5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demands of Paris–Roubaix {{have included the}} use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{relaying}} of the line west from Temple Meads with four tracks instead of two. Considerable engineering works were needed <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> widening of the station, including the removal of a short tunnel {{to the west of}} the station. The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933, and the station name was changed to simply Parson Street in November 1933.

In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E

Baker Street station was rebuilt with four tracks and two island platforms in 1912. <b>To</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rise in traffic the line south of Harrow was quadrupled, in 1913 from Finchley Road to Kilburn, in 1915 to Wembley Park; the line from Finchley Road to Baker Street remained double track, causing a bottleneck.|$|E

These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E

30|$|Consequently, a {{considerable}} amount of efforts has been directed towards elaborating strategies for dealing <b>with</b> diversity. Despite <b>the</b> high organizational and strategic expenditure, there is still a widespread uncertainty as to what degree the implemented strategies can contribute <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complexity. It is considered that the subsequent decline in revenue upon patent expiry is inevitable, but the introduction of new business logic and an analytical approach to value capturing will lead to higher efficiency levels of certain process steps.|$|R
