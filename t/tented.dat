5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone <b>tented</b> roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone <b>tented</b> roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent <b>tented</b> roof churches.|$|E

50|$|The camp {{consisted}} of two hospital <b>tents</b> (used as dining <b>tent),</b> ten wall <b>tents</b> and <b>tents</b> for servants and soldiers. Three wall <b>tents</b> were floored and the Alexei's was carpeted with oriental rugs. Box stoves and Sibley stoves were provided for the <b>tents.</b>|$|R
50|$|A wall <b>tent,</b> {{also known}} as an {{outfitter}} <b>tent,</b> safari <b>tent,</b> or sheep herder <b>tent</b> {{is a type of}} <b>tent</b> that has four straight vertical walls that provide more headroom than traditional pyramid-shaped <b>tents.</b> Wall <b>tents</b> are typically made of a heavy canvas and are used by hunters because they can accommodate several people and their supplies. Wall <b>tents</b> are suitable as a four-season <b>tent,</b> as they are able to accommodate a wood stove. Wall <b>tents</b> are commonly used in Civil War reenactments, and, in recent years, have also become used for glamping. Frames may be either internal or external.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to the property, and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary <b>tented</b> village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England's longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, {{at one point in}} the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate's farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He <b>tented</b> the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tented</b> {{churches were}} popular {{during the reign}} of Ivan the Terrible. Two prime {{examples}} dating from his reign employ several tents of exotic shapes and colors, arranged in an intricate design: the Church of St John the Baptist in Kolomenskoye (1547) and Saint Basil's Cathedral on Red Square (1561). The latter church unites nine <b>tented</b> roofs in a striking circular composition.|$|E
5000|$|The inner <b>tent</b> {{comprises}} the main living and sleeping {{area of the}} <b>tent.</b> For double skin <b>tents,</b> the inner <b>tent</b> (often mesh) is not waterproof since it is protected by the rain fly. For single skin <b>tents,</b> the inner <b>tent</b> is often made of waterproof-breathable material that prevents liquid water from penetrating {{the inside of the}} <b>tent,</b> but still allows water vapour to be transported out.|$|R
5000|$|Range <b>tents</b> {{are similar}} to spike <b>tents</b> in their shape and size, except range <b>tents</b> usually do not have side walls at all. They {{resemble}} a pyramid type shape and are {{often referred to as}} pyramid <b>tents.</b> Range <b>tents</b> can either be set up with a bi-pole system that goes {{on the outside of the}} <b>tent,</b> or they can be set up using a single frame pole which goes in the middle of the <b>tent</b> on the inside, and they can also be set up by tying the top of the <b>tent</b> to a hanging tree branch. Also known as teepee <b>tents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because truck <b>tent</b> camping is a {{somewhat}} novel idea, few companies produce them. Napier and The Adventure Truck <b>Tent</b> {{are the most}} notable names in truck <b>tent</b> camping, followed closely by Rightline Gear, which brands their truck <b>tents</b> under the name CampRight. Although most truck <b>tents</b> are fundamentally the same, they do contain some variation. Napier’s truck <b>tents</b> are completely enclosed, which means there is a layer of <b>tent</b> that covers {{the bottom of the}} truck bed. In contrast, the Adventure Truck <b>Tent</b> and CampRight truck <b>tents</b> leave the bottom open and bare. Napier <b>tents</b> also include a small awning for added rain protection. Kodiak is known for its tunnel shape design which promotes a roomier camping.|$|R
25|$|Other common {{fingerprint}} patterns {{include the}} <b>tented</b> arch, the plain arch, {{and the central}} pocket loop.|$|E

25|$|The {{church was}} looted in 1922 and closed in 1931; soon, it was {{converted}} to a library, than a warehouse, losing the <b>tented</b> roofs and all interior trim. In 1977, the city started demolition, destroyed the apse and northern chapel; public intervention saved {{the rest of the}} building, which was eventually rebuilt to original design in 1997-2002.|$|E
50|$|NEMO's {{core product}} line {{includes}} {{a wide range}} of <b>tents</b> and shelters. The <b>tents</b> range from single-person bivy sacks to larger base camp mountaineering <b>tents.</b> NEMO uses several different kinds of structural elements to support their <b>tents</b> including traditional aluminum <b>tent</b> poles and low pressure air beams.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tents</b> {{are often}} used in {{humanitarian}} emergencies, such as war, earthquakes and fire. The primary choice of <b>tents</b> in humanitarian emergencies are canvas <b>tents,</b> because a cotton canvas <b>tent</b> allows functional breathability while serving the purpose of temporary shelter. <b>Tents</b> distributed by organisations such as UNHCR are made by various manufacturers, depending on the region where the <b>tents</b> are deployed, as well as depending on the purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>tenting</b> {{games in a}} single season is {{determined}} by the Line Monitor Committee of the Duke Student Government. The UNC game is always a <b>tenting</b> game but potentially there may be a second game where <b>tent</b> order determines seating. Months before the actual game, students begin to put up and live in <b>tents</b> outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. As many as twelve people can occupy a specific <b>tent</b> group (a <b>tent</b> group may contain up to two physical <b>tents).</b> As regulated by Duke Student Government, there must be a certain number of students in the <b>tent</b> at regular, periodic checks.|$|R
25|$|Game {{parks are}} {{a major source of}} hard {{currency}} for Kenya. Entry fees are currently US$80 for adult non-East African Residents and $30 for children. There are a number of lodges and <b>tented</b> camps for tourists inside the Reserve and the Conservation area borders. The tourists/visitors cater for their own expenses, unless previously arranged by their agencies.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{there were}} a total of 45 <b>tented</b> camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men {{captured}} as prisoners of war, 25,630 were sent overseas. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Over 26,000 {{women and children were}} to perish in these concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|The {{formerly}} opened ground-floor arcades {{were filled}} with brick walls; the new space housed altars from thirteen former wooden churches erected {{on the site of}} Ivan's executions in Red Square. Wooden shelters above the first-floor platform and stairs (the cause of frequent fires) were rebuilt in brick, creating the present-day wraparound galleries with <b>tented</b> roofs above the porches and vestibules.|$|E
5000|$|The festival had {{formerly}} featured nine main dance <b>tents</b> and stages: Main [...] "Glade" [...] Dance <b>Tent</b> (major artists), Breaksday (UK breakbeat), idSpiral (chillout and non-musical acts), Liquid Connective (psy-trance), Origin (psy-trance), Sancho Panza (house), Pussy Parlure (soul, salsa, R&B, reggae and world), Overkill (formerly the LittleBig <b>tent,</b> featuring breakcore, gabber techno and mash-up) and the Rabbit Hole (secret club, party <b>tent,</b> jam <b>tent</b> by Arabian <b>Tent</b> Company). However, {{the main}} dance <b>tent</b> was scrapped for the 2007 event {{and replaced by}} a new open air stage for predominantly live acts and two smaller <b>tents</b> comprising a techno <b>tent</b> (Vapor) and the Roots <b>Tent,</b> which is themed {{on the origins of}} dance music. There was also a new space called the Nectar Temple, comprising visionary and performance arts from a Californian arts collective.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tent</b> {{caterpillars}} {{are readily}} recognized {{because they are}} social, colorful, diurnal and build conspicuous silk <b>tents</b> in the branches of host trees. Some species, such as the eastern <b>tent</b> caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, build a single large <b>tent</b> which is typically occupied through {{the whole of the}} larval stage, while others build a series of small <b>tents</b> that are sequentially abandoned. Whereas <b>tent</b> caterpillars make their <b>tents</b> in the nodes and branches of a tree's limbs, webworms enclose leaves and small branches at the ends of the limbs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tent</b> cities: Ad hoc campsites of <b>tents</b> and improvised shelters {{consisting}} of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as rail yards, highways and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate <b>tent</b> cities, such as Dignity Village, are actually hybrids of <b>tent</b> cities and shantytowns. <b>Tent</b> cities frequently consist only of <b>tents</b> and fabric improvised structures, with no semi-permanent wood structures at all.|$|R
25|$|The {{area was}} used to {{quarantine}} soldiers coming from the conflict. The most prominent group among the 20,000 soldiers who passed through the base were Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. The <b>tented</b> camp became a national scandal over the poor treatment of troops (256 died there) and President William McKinley visited to emphasize improvements. Exhibits and artifacts from the camp are at Theodore Roosevelt County Park.|$|E
25|$|The two {{independent}} rifle platoons, No.9 and No.11, were dropped quite accurately to the north. They immediately went into action, moving through a <b>tented</b> camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas. Resistance was fierce but short-lived, {{and a total}} of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route.|$|E
25|$|In Russia, for {{the most}} part, the Baroque style was {{overlaid}} as architectonic features on the essentially Byzantine forms used for church construction. Many churches were built in this style, notably the Cathedral of the Dormition at Smolensk and the Cathedral of the Presentation at Solvychegodsk. In the design of many churches the Byzantine arrangement of <b>tented</b> roof or onion dome is replaced with a larger dome, usually on a tall, often polygonal, tambour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tent</b> is a {{protocol}} for open, decentralized social networking. <b>Tent</b> users share content with apps and each other.
