In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album King of the Delta Blues Singers included reminiscences of Don Law who had recorded Johnson in 1936.

25|$|Organizing {{among the}} more {{dispersed}} transit workers outside the powerhouses, machine shops and car barns proved to more challenging. The union relied to some extent on the network of Clan na Gael members scattered throughout the IRT; those workers could appeal, using the prestige of their past association with the Irish Republican Army, {{to the thousands of}} Irish workers around them. The clandestine style of the IRA both aided in organizing fearful workers and attracted them by imbuing the organization with <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of secrecy and intrigue.|$|E
25|$|When Fonteyn danced the lead, {{the ballet}} was {{about her and}} her performance; however good today's interpreters may be, none has <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> to reduce {{everyone}} else to the background, and so the supporting roles are now much more visible {{and need to be}} much more strongly depicted. It is generally accepted that Tirrenio was originally the most completely worked out role, inherited from Alexander Grant's lack of awe for Fonteyn; however the role has become difficult to cast as it was created to showcase Grant's unique mixture of gifts – classical virtuosity and flair for characterisation.|$|E

25|$|Hausgemacht (German for home-made, often {{abbreviated}} as HG) {{refers to}} clandestine absinthe (not {{be confused with}} the Swiss La Clandestine brand) that is home-distilled by hobbyists. It {{should not be confused with}} absinthe kits. Hausgemacht absinthe is produced in tiny quantities for personal use and not for the commercial market. Clandestine production increased after absinthe was banned, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. Although the ban has been lifted in Switzerland, some clandestine distillers have not legitimised their production. Authorities believe that high taxes on alcohol and <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of being underground are likely reasons.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, lucha libre {{would be}} forever changed when a silver-masked wrestler, {{known simply as}} El Santo (The Saint), first stepped into the ring. He made his debut in Mexico City by winning an 8-man battle royal. The public became enamored by <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> and secrecy of Santo's personality, and he quickly became the most popular luchador in Mexico. His wrestling career spanned nearly five decades, during which he became a folk hero and a symbol of justice for the common man through his {{appearances}} in comic books and movies, while the sport received an unparalleled degree of mainstream attention.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Pétain, de Gaulle {{believed}} {{in the use of}} tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare. De Gaulle became a disciple of Emile Mayer (1851-25 November 1938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker. Mayer thought that war was now obsolete as an instrument of foreign policy. He had a low opinion of the quality of French generals, and was a critic of the Maginot Line and a prophet of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that Mayer focussed de Gaulle’s thoughts away from his obsession with <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of the strong leader (Le Fil d’Epée: 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} summer, and early fall of 1995 saw {{the release of}} Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., and GZA's Liquid Swords, which {{would turn out to}} be the group's two most {{significant}} and well-received solo projects. Cuban Linx was a diverse, theatrical criminological epic that saw RZA move away from the raw, stripped-down beats of the early albums and towards a richer, cinematic sound more reliant on strings and classic soul samples. The album is highly notable in that it revived, and expanded the Mafioso rap subgenre, which started to decline several years beforehand. Lavish living and the crime underworld are referenced throughout using quotes from the John Woo movie The Killer, with <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of the Wu-Tang Clan deepened by the adoption of crime boss aliases and the crew name Wu-Gambinos. The album introduced a flurry of slang words to the rap lexicon, and many artists have gone on to imitate its materialism. Cuban Linx featured all but one Wu member, and featured the debut from Cappadonna. The album also featured rapper Nas, who was the first non-Wu-Tang-affiliated MC to appear on a Wu-Tang Clan album. GZA's Liquid Swords had a similar focus on inner-city criminology akin to Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, but it was far darker, both in GZA's grim lyrics and in the ominous, foreboding production that saw RZA experimenting more with keyboards than ever before. Liquid Swords features guest appearances from every Wu-Tang Clan member, and is linked together by excerpts from the movie Shogun Assassin. 1995 also saw the release of the Wu Wear clothing line, which {{would turn out to be}} massively successful, and influential on hip hop culture. It initially started as a mere way to make money from the demand for bootleg Wu-Tang Clan shirts, and evolved into an extensive collection of designer garments. Soon, other hip hop artists were making similar ventures and by the mid-2000s, a clothing line was almost a prerequisite for hip hop superstardom, with clothing lines launched by Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, Nelly, Ludacris, 50 Cent, and more.|$|E

[...] Oral history has preserved numerous legends about this king, including several dramatic military victories, contributing to his heroic and near-mythical status among the kings of ancient Imerina. The circumstances surrounding his birth, which occurred on the highly auspicious date of the first of the year, are said to be supernatural in nature and further add to <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of this sovereign.|$|E

500|$|The gaps, {{the longest}} of which {{measures}} about [...] long, {{appear to have}} followed {{the line of the}} hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from Titanics builders, Harland and Wolff, suggested this scenario at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted. Titanics discoverer Robert Ballard has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a major breach was [...] "a by-product of <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of the Titanic. No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver." [...] Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of Titanics hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.|$|E
500|$|Boys Don't Cry {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} and analyzed by scholars and others. Roger Ebert described the film as a [...] "romantic tragedy" [...] embedded in a working class American setting, calling it [...] "Romeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska trailer park". Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued {{that the question of}} identity—particularly Brandon's—is alluded to frequently in Boys Don't Cry and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film's main question. Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity. Paula Nechak called the film a [...] "bold cautionary tale"; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that [...] " [...] captured <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> and eerie loneliness" [...] and [...] "isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair".|$|E

500|$|The {{promotion}} {{met with}} some positive reviews. Time called it [...] "clever", and {{a columnist for}} the Chicago Tribune stated that Herb was [...] "one of the most famous men in America". Ultimately, however, the Herb promotion {{has been described as a}} flop. The advertising campaign lasted three months before it was discontinued. [...] One Burger King franchise owner stated that the problem was that [...] "there was absolutely no relevant message". Although some initial results were positive, <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> was lost after Herb's appearance was revealed during the Super Bowl. Burger King's profits fell 40% in 1986. As a result of the poorly received campaign, Burger King dropped J. Walter Thompson from their future advertising. The US$200 million account was initially given to N. W. Ayer. After 18 months it went to another agency, as Ayer was having problems, and Burger King wanted to improve the bottom line.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the lines}} in the episode proved {{difficult}} for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans {{did not believe the}} revelation because [...] "part of <b>the</b> <b>mystique</b> of it was that everybody had their own idea of what was going on." [...] The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. When she talked to Carter, she said that she did not [...] "know if [...] do this anymore" [...] because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's [...] "believer versus skeptic" [...] dynamic to work properly.|$|E
