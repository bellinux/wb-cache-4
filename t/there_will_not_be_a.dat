25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia.

25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unique mean. For example, the times {{an hour before}} and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It {{is also possible that}} no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E
25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change {{in the structure of the}} die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can you explain to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> general screening." ...|$|E
