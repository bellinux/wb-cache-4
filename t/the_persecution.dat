5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> under Constantius was {{relatively}} light, {{there is no}} doubt about the force of <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E

5|$|After {{the launch}} of <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> {{campaign}} in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to coincide with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>persecution.</b> There is usually a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{historical}} examination of the Marian and Elizabethan <b>persecutions.</b> Through <b>the</b> analysis of primary sources dating from <b>the</b> <b>persecutions,</b> <b>the</b> process of <b>persecution</b> in Reformation England is examined. This thesis uncovers the similarities that existed between <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> of Mary and Elizabeth. The most important and most damaging to <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> was martyrdom. Because martyrdom presented itself, both Queens and the supporters of <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> issued anti-martyrologies that defended <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> and refuted <b>the</b> martyrdom claims of the persecuted. This paper examines the documents of Marian and Elizabethan <b>persecutions</b> that reveal <b>the</b> process of <b>persecutions,</b> with <b>the</b> anti-martyrologies being the most important. This examination is divided into the study of <b>the</b> Marian <b>persecutions,</b> <b>the</b> impact of John Foxe 2 Ì† 7 s Acts and Monuments, and <b>the</b> Elizabethan <b>persecutions.</b> This examination reveals the need of the Crown and those that supported <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> to justify and explain {{the application of the}} death penalty, to defend <b>the</b> <b>persecutions</b> as martyrdom was applied, and finally to refute and counter this martyrdom...|$|R

5|$|Although further persecutionary edicts followed, {{compelling}} {{the arrest}} of the Christian clergy and universal acts of sacrifice, the persecutionary edicts were ultimately unsuccessful; most Christians escaped punishment, and pagans too were generally unsympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>persecution.</b> The martyrs' sufferings strengthened the resolve of their fellow Christians. Constantius and Maximian did not apply the later persecutionary edicts, and left the Christians of the West unharmed. Galerius rescinded the edict in 311, announcing that <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> had failed to bring Christians back to traditional religion. The temporary apostasy of some Christians, and the surrendering of scriptures, during <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> {{played a major role}} in the subsequent Donatist controversy. Within twenty-five years of the persecution's inauguration, the Christian Emperor Constantine would rule the empire alone. He would reverse the consequences of the edicts, and return all confiscated property to Christians. Under Constantine's rule, Christianity would become the empire's preferred religion. Diocletian was demonized by his Christian successors: Lactantius intimated that Diocletian's ascendancy heralded the apocalypse, and in Serbian mythology, Diocletian is remembered as Dukljan, the adversary of God.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and mitigate <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, the Chinese Communist Party has persecuted Falun Gong in {{mainland}} China. In response, Falun Gong practitioners {{around the world}} have conducted activities aimed at raising awareness about the related human rights issues. These include lobbying, passing out of flyers, participating in sit-ins in front of Chinese embassies and consulates, and staging parades and demonstrations. They have established media outlets, have founded advocacy and research organizations to report information on <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> in China, and launched lawsuits against the alleged architects and participants of <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> campaign.|$|E

5|$|Persecutory {{policies}} {{varied in}} intensity across the empire. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, Constantius was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including {{the calls for}} universal sacrifice, were not applied in his domain. His son, Constantine, on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during <b>the</b> <b>persecution.</b> In Italy in 306, the usurper Maxentius ousted Maximian's successor Severus, promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended <b>the</b> <b>persecution</b> in the East in 311, but it was resumed in Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor by his successor, Maximinus. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the Edict of Milan in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.|$|E

5|$|The Diocletianic or Great Persecution was {{the last}} and most severe {{persecution}} of Christians in the Roman Empire. In 303, the Emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius, and Constantius issued a series of edicts rescinding the legal rights of Christians and demanding that they comply with traditional Roman religious practices. Later edicts targeted the clergy and ordered all inhabitants to sacrifice to the Roman gods (a policy known as universal sacrifice). <b>The</b> <b>persecution</b> varied in intensity across the empireweakest in Gaul and Britain, where only the first edict was applied, and strongest in the Eastern provinces.
