5|$|Another council plan {{during the}} 1960s was to {{separate}} pedestrians and traffic, {{and it was}} proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be built with an overhead walkway – <b>this</b> <b>never</b> came to fruition, with only a short section ever being built.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} black metal. During the early 1990s when the band was known as Crush Evil, Euronymous, guitarist for the seminal black metal band Mayhem, was planning to stop Crush Evil from continuing. However, <b>this</b> <b>never</b> took place.|$|E

5|$|Conan the Destroyer was {{released}} in 1984, with Schwarzenegger and Mako reprising their roles. A planned third entry in the trilogy, Conan the Conqueror was previewed {{at the end of}} Destroyer. Conqueror was planned for 1987 release, but <b>this</b> <b>never</b> came to fruition. A derivation of the script was adapted to become the 1997 film, Kull the Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|The West Somerset Railway opened {{as far as}} Watchet on 3 March 1862. Although a {{connection}} with the WSMR was suggested, involving laying of mixed gauge on the Mineral line, <b>this</b> <b>never</b> happened.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, <b>this</b> <b>never</b> took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but <b>this</b> <b>never</b> materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Bug! {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of a 3D platforming game. It was also the first platform game to be released on the Saturn in Europe. By the end of 1995, 150,000 copies of Bug! had been sold in the United States, making it the second most popular Saturn game behind Daytona USA. According to Sega, discussions were underway for an animated TV series, though <b>this</b> <b>never</b> materialised. A direct sequel, Bug Too!, was released for the Saturn in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but <b>this</b> <b>never</b> happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that <b>this</b> <b>never</b> happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, <b>this</b> <b>never</b> amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although <b>this</b> <b>never</b> occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but <b>this</b> <b>never</b> happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Each {{instalment}} is {{a separate}} adaptation of a short story, ranges between 30 and 50 minutes in duration, and features well-known British actors such as Clive Swift, Robert Hardy, Peter Vaughan, Edward Petherbridge and Denholm Elliott. The first five are adaptations of ghost stories by M. R. James, the sixth {{is based on a}} short story by Charles Dickens, and the two final instalments are original screenplays by Clive Exton and John Bowen respectively. The stories were titled A Ghost Story for Christmas in listings such as the Radio Times, although <b>this</b> <b>never</b> appeared on screen, where they were regarded as individual films.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although <b>this</b> <b>never</b> occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

He became an {{acknowledged}} expert on mosses, and William Hooker, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was so impressed with his skills that he hoped to employ him as a herbarium assistant. Although <b>this</b> <b>never</b> came about, Hooker gave Buxton a number of botanical books and, at some point, Buxton accepted the position of President of the Manchester Working Men's Botanical Society.|$|E
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of <b>this</b> <b>never</b> eventuated.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately <b>this</b> <b>never</b> happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
