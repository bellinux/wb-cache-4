5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to tell {{how much of the}} content of these traditional biographies is fiction and how much is fact. Large parts clearly are mere deduction from Juvenal's writings, but some elements appear more substantial. Juvenal never mentions a period of exile in his life, yet it appears in every extant traditional biography. Many scholars <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to be a later invention; the Satires do display some knowledge of Egypt and Britain, and it is thought that this gave rise to the tradition that Juvenal was exiled. Others, however - particularly Gilbert Highet - regard the exile as factual, and these scholars also supply a concrete date for the exile: 93 AD until 96, when Nerva became emperor. They argue that a reference to Juvenal in one of Martial's poems, which is dated to 92, {{is impossible}} if, at this stage Juvenal was already in exile, or, had served his time in exile, since in that case, Martial would not have wished to antagonise Domitian by mentioning such a persona non grata as Juvenal. If Juvenal was exiled, he would have lost his patrimony, and this may explain the consistent descriptions {{of the life of the}} client he bemoans in the Satires.|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E

500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{started in}} 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a {{collaboration}} between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto spoke of the name as [...] "a reference, a rough translation from the book. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is interesting, it's {{a metaphor for the}} future," [...] he explained. [...] "Thirty seconds to Marsâ€”the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for my brother and I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible." [...] He described it as a name that [...] "works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy." [...] When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.|$|E
500|$|Watsuki based most of Kenshin's {{abilities}} {{on a real}} swordsman of the Tokugawa period named , who was {{skilled in}} acrobatic techniques. However, one of Kenshin's moves where he stops an enemy's flamethrower by rotating his sword received multiple complaints with Watsuki admitting the move as somewhat out of place and [...] "not really organic" [...] to his world. By early publication of Rurouni Kenshin, Watsuki was unsure whether or not Kenshin and Kamiya Kaoru would become lovers in future chapters. Sagara Sanosuke was created to be Kenshin's best friend who would punch him order to make him retain his composure. However, Watsuki did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> worked as much as possibly. During his fight against Shishio Makoto's army, Kenshin is given a new sword with a sheath made of wood. Though {{it is more difficult}} to draw, Watsuki decided to redesign the sword {{to make it look like}} the first one Kenshin had in the series. For the final fight between Kenshin and Shishio, Watsuki admitted he expressed more joy in drawing Shishio than Kenshin. During this arc and mostly the final fight between Kenshin and Shishio's fight Watsuki kept listening to the song [...] "In The Blue Sky" [...] from the video game Virtual On; the song's title was used in the final chapter of the Kyoto arc. Additionally, the final shot of Kenshin returning to Kaoru's dojo was inspired by the final shot of the Rurouni Kenshin anime's first opening theme:"Sobakasu" [...] by Judy and Mary.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
50|$|He {{is invited}} to a lecture by German {{explosives}} expert Siegfried Von Bulow who proposes <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of sending a projectile to the moon using a powerful new explosive. Von Bulow is ridiculed but Barnum <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> has <b>the</b> potential to make him money. He sets about finding the financial backing {{in order to build}} a giant cannon to fire the projectile, carrying a reluctant Tom Thumb.|$|R

50|$|The others admire Vaska for {{his courage}} and urge him to kill Kostilyoff and marry Vassilisa; {{then he could}} be landlord. Vaska <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> over for a time but decides that he is too softhearted to be a landlord. Besides, he is {{thinking}} of discarding Vassilisa for her sister, Natasha. Satine asks Vaska for twenty kopecks, which the thief is glad to give; he is afraid Satine will want a ruble next.|$|R
2500|$|In a final irony, {{the printer}} gave the entire print {{run of the}} {{magazine}} to the Niggerati, {{in the hope that}} they would sell better in quantity, only for several hundred copies to be lost in a fire in the basement in which they were stored. [...] Hurston later commented [...] "I suppose that 'Fire' has gone to ashes quite, but I still <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is good.".|$|E
2500|$|... "I've {{always been}} {{attracted}} to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I {{read a lot of}} books like The Naked Island about Russell Braddon and his experiences on the Burma-Thai Railway and The Cattle King, which is the biography of Sidney Kidman, and they {{had a profound impact on}} me and I read those books many times. So I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Mervyn Watson, former executive producer of Casualty, has commented on the origins of the idea to fully cross the two shows over for the first time: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> came from somebody in the comedy department, who casually said to the Controller of Drama 'Wouldn't it be a good idea if...' The Controller did {{think it was a good}} idea, spoke to myself and Holby's executive producer, got it commissioned by the Head of BBC One and the rest is history." ...|$|E
5000|$|Former B.C. cabinet {{minister}} Dr. Patrick McGeer, a research neuroscientist and a science advocate, has repeatedly advanced the proposal in recent decades. In a CKNW news item broadcast in August 2008, McGeer said he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> just needs [...] "a visionary politician" [...] to support it. McGeer {{still has the}} conceptual model of the bridge that was displayed at Expo 86. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> has formal opposition {{in the form of}} an Islands Trust policy banning the building of any bridges or tunnels connecting the Gulf Islands to the Mainland or Vancouver Island.|$|R

2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state {{organized}} around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We {{need look no further}} than the fact that the rest of the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it certainly should be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a religious state is ultimately untenable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Creators of Gorillaz, {{musician}} Damon Albarn {{and artist}} Jamie Hewlett, {{began working on}} a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's third studio album. In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied [...] "Well, I'm doing the next Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz." [...] In the February 2008 Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their moviesâ€“ Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none {{of the members of the}} band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle." [...] In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, [...] "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any moreâ€” it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal modelâ€” Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and now want to give you new stuff." ...|$|E

50|$|Cocktails of the Sour Type use as modifying agents a {{fruit juice}} (typically, lemon or lime) and sugar. For these {{a ratio of}} 1 part sweet to 2 parts sour to 8 parts base is {{generally}} recommended. However, Embury makes {{it very clear that}} he <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that a drink must be made according to one exact recipe preposterous, and that the final arbiter is always your taste. He suggests trying different ratios, finding the one that is most pleasing to you, and sticking with it.|$|R
50|$|Tommy finds Jeff and announces his {{intention}} to stay. Jeff <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is absurd and argues with Tommy until he has convinced him that Brigadoon is only a dream. Jeff also reveals that he tripped Harry and accidentally killed him. Fiona and Mr. Lundie arrive, and Tommy, shaken by Jeff's confession, tells Fiona that he loves her, but he can't stay; he still has doubts ("From This Day On"). Fiona tells Tommy, as she fades away into darkness, that she will love him forever.|$|R
40|$|Victor Tadros <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that in a}} {{conflict}} both sides may permissibly use force should (typically) be rejected. Thus, he thinks that two shipwrecked persons should not fight for the only available flotsam (which can only carry one person) but instead toss a coin, and that a bomber justifiably attacking an ammunitions factory must not be counterattacked by the innocent bystanders he endangers. I shall argue that Tadrosâ€™s claim rests on unwarranted assumptions and is also mistaken {{in the light of}} the moral reasoning that he himself offers in support of his â€˜means principle...|$|R

60|$|Therefore I doubt not but children, by the {{exercise}} of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies that environ them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer; amongst which (if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable of examination) I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of hunger and warmth are two: which probably {{are some of the}} first that children have, and which they scarce ever part with again.|$|R
