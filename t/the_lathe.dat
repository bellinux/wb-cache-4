5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented {{witnesses who}} testified to bloodstains and {{strands of hair}} found on <b>the</b> <b>lathe,</b> to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas. To the credit of the Western Chalukya architects {{is the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> turned (tuned) pillars and use of Soapstone (Chloritic Schist) as basic building and sculptural material, a very popular idiom in later Hoysala temples. They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural idiom was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the hair on <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that}} the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E

5000|$|Wood lathes {{work with}} either {{reciprocating}} or continuous revolution. <b>The</b> reciprocating <b>lathe</b> {{is powered by}} a bow or a spring, rotating the wood first in one direction, and then in the other. The turner cuts on just one side of the rotation, as with <b>the</b> pole <b>lathe.</b> <b>The</b> reciprocating <b>lathe</b> may be human-powered with a bow, as well as with spring mechanisms. <b>The</b> reciprocating <b>lathe,</b> while primitive technology requiring considerable dexterity to operate, is capable of excellent results in skilled hands. For example, reciprocating bow lathes are still used to turn beads for the Arabian lattice windows called Meshrebeeyeh that so charmed Holtzapffel in the 1880s [...]|$|R
50|$|Woodturning is {{the craft}} of using <b>the</b> wood <b>lathe</b> with {{hand-held}} tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Like the potter's wheel, <b>the</b> wood <b>lathe</b> is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms. The operator {{is known as a}} turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish woodturning and <b>the</b> wood <b>lathe</b> from <b>the</b> machinists <b>lathe,</b> or metal-working lathe.|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on <b>the</b> <b>lathe,</b> for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889 Hartness {{moved to}} Springfield, Vermont {{to become the}} {{superintendent}} at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J) Machine Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the burgeoning automobile industry. The flat turret lathe improved upon earlier turret lathes via greater rigidity, allowing higher precision, higher speeds and feeds, and longer cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to complement <b>the</b> <b>lathe,</b> including improved roller bar feed and die head designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made faster, and thus less expensively, which made <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> highly desirable to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend his interest in his patent. He arranged with J to receive a $100 royalty on each machine.|$|E

25|$|Blanchard {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to gun barrels, and invented a machine tool that streamlined the process of their manufacture. Hired by the Springfield Armory during its construction, Blanchard finished the machine in 1822.

25|$|Diamond turning â€“ This type is cut and {{polished}} on a CNC lathe. The lens starts {{out as a}} cylindrical disk held in the jaws of <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material {{from the inside of}} the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut {{and polished}} by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.|$|E

500|$|As Longacre {{worked on}} the double eagle design, {{according}} to numismatist Walter Breen, [...] "Peale, with Patterson's tacit approval, began harassment." [...] Longacre prepared a large model of the new coin in wax, and was instructed {{to give it to}} Peale for use in preparing a metal galvano, which could be used in <b>the</b> <b>lathe.</b> The operation failed, and Longacre's model was destroyed.

[...] Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on <b>the</b> <b>lathe,</b> the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel <b>The</b> <b>Lathe</b> of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a {{regional}} sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary {{for the purposes of the}} law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): [...] "northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent.|$|E
500|$|White {{was willing}} to print a variety of fiction, with {{traditional}} stories side-by-side with more experimental material that {{was influenced by the}} British New Wave or by 1960s psychedelia. In 1971 he serialized Ursula K. Le Guin's <b>The</b> <b>Lathe</b> of Heaven, about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer who was influenced by this was James Tiptree, Jr., who later wrote that [...] "after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 Amazing in which Lathe came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up." [...] White's willingness to experiment led to Amazing running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own [...] "Growing Up Fast in the City", was criticized as pornographic by some of Amazings readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's [...] "Two of a Kind", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White also printed more conventional fiction, however, much of it of high quality. The magazine was nominated for the Hugo award (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.|$|E

Ray of Light is truly like a prayer, and you know she'll take you there." [...] Roni Sarig, in a review for City Pages, was most impressed by Madonna's vocal range, depth, and clarity and called Ray of Light [...] "her richest, most accomplished record yet." [...] Music critic Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "One reason why her new Ray of Light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching {{of a woman who}} is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective." [...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and BjÃ¶rk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on <b>the</b> <b>lathe</b> of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it." [...] Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe said that Ray of Light is a remarkable album. He described it as a deeply spiritual dance record, ecstatically textured, a serious cycle of songs that {{goes a long way toward}} liberating Madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities. Robert Christgau was less impressed in Playboy, deeming Ray of Light a [...] "great-sounding" [...] but average record because of enlightenment themes that always yield awkward results for pop entertainers, although he praised sensual songs such as [...] "Skin" [...] and [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E
