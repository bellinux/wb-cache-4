40|$|The {{entry of}} a {{high-speed}} train into a tunnel {{leads to a}} system of strong pressure waves inside the tunnel. These abrupt pressure changes go along with many disadvantages. The crucial parameter for the negative effects of the train-tunnel passage is the time derivative of the pressure and therefore the rise time of the pressure. A possible countermeasure is a hood equipped with several windows acting as an extended tunnel portal. The effect of the additional <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> is highly influenced by the number and size of the portal windows, so the choice of the outflow area is very important. To get {{a better understanding of the}} effect of a vented <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> experimental studies using an ICE 3 -model (scaled 1 : 25), a 10 m-long model tunnel and a <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> (both scaled 1 : 30) were performed at the tunnel-simulation facility G¨ottingen (TSG). The resulting blockage ratio was �Beta = 0 : 23. The pressure inside the tunnel was measured using pressure transducers and additionally the flow out of the portal windows was investigated using Particle Image Velocimetry. The studies result in an optimised tunnel-portal configuration. The pressure gradient can be reduced by about 60...|$|E
40|$|The {{passage of}} a {{high-speed}} train through a vented <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> was studied experimentally in model scale. The pressure history inside the tunnel was observed using pressure transducers, and the flow field outside the portal vents was recorded using an optical measurement technique. The pressure gradients inside the tunnel and the air volume exhausted through the vents are considered for different vent configurations. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions. The dependence of the pressure history on the position {{and size of the}} vents is explained. By optimising their configuration the pressure gradients could be reduced significantly...|$|E
40|$|When {{high-speed}} train {{passing through}} tunnel, aerodynamic effect will be created, which may arise micro-pressure wave at tunnel exit and affect the surrounding environment around <b>tunnel.</b> Setting <b>hood</b> at <b>tunnel</b> entrance is effective and economical method. Using numeral simulation method, {{two kinds of}} hood mechanics character under deadweight and aerodynamic load were analysed. The stress concentration field on the hood and {{the magnitude of the}} stress caused by aerodynamic loading was defined. By comparing the aerodynamic loading method of pseudo-static and dynamic real-time, the necessity for doing real-time dynamic analysis is shown. The recommended kind of hood also was point out...|$|R
40|$|When a train {{enters a}} tunnel at high speed, an {{explosive}} noise is sometimes emitted from the exit {{and there are}} cases where doors and windows of nearby houses are shaken. This phenomenon {{is caused by a}} tunnel micro-pressure wave (hereafter: micro-pressure wave) and there are cases where this is an environmental issue. The micro-pressure wave is caused by the compression wave formed when a train enters a tunnel entrance and decrease in the gradient (rate of pressure change over time; hereafter: pressure gradient) of the wave front of the compression wave leads to a reduction in the micro-pressure wave. Here, the <b>tunnel</b> entrance <b>hood</b> (hereafter: hood) shown in Fig. 1 is a ground installation that is a countermeasure for decreasing the pressure gradient of the compressio...|$|R
40|$|When a {{high-speed}} train enters a tunnel, a compression wave is generated and travels {{through the tunnel}} at sonic speeds. When the wave reaches the exit, the compression wave is radiated as impulsive wave. This is called a micro-pressure wave (See Fig. 1) and causes noise and vibration problems. There are two countermeasures for reducing this micro-pressure wave; (1) wayside measures including a <b>hood</b> at the <b>tunnel</b> entrance (a <b>hood</b> installed at the tunnel entrance on the train incoming side, and the cross-sectional area is 1. 4 times {{the area of the}} tunnel, as seen in Fig. 2. It has air vents on its side. (2) measures for trains such as reduction of the car cross-sectional area and extension of the nose length. We have adopted measures for trains to reduce the micro-pressure wave by improving the nose shape of the car. The micro-pressure wave increases with the rate of change of th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{relates to}} the {{parametric}} study of tunnel hoods {{in order to reduce}} the shape, i. e. the temporal gradient, of the pressure wave generated by the entry of a High speed train in tunnel. This is achieved by using an in-house three-dimensional numerical solver which solves the Eulerian equations on a Cartesian and unstructured mesh. The efficiency of the numerical methodology is demonstrated through comparisons with both experimental data and empirical formula. For the <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> design, three parameters, that can influence the wave shape, are considered: the shape, the section and the length of the hood. The numerical results show, (i) that a constant section hood is the most efficient shape when compared to progressive (elliptic or conical) section hoods, (ii) an optimal ratio between hood's section and tunnel section where the temporal gradient of the pressure wave can be reduced by half, (iii) a significant efficiency of the hood's length in the range of 2 - 8 times the length of the train nose. Finally the influence of the train's speed is investigated and results point out that the optimum section is slightly modified by the train's speed...|$|E
40|$|During {{the entry}} of a {{high-speed}} train into a tunnel, pressure waves are generated, which increases the loads {{on the structure of}} the train and the tunnel and on the equipment inside the tunnel. Furthermore, the instantaneous pressure changes can cause discomfort of the train's passengers. Further, if the tunnel walls are smooth and there is no ballast bed, the compression wave generated due to the train's nose entry can steepen and results in the so-called tunnel-boom {{at the opposite end of}} the tunnel. To ensure a safe and comfortable tunnel passage modern high-speed trains are sealed, which involves extra weight and therefore a higher energy consumption of the train. Furthermore, the train velocity is reduced during the tunnel passage. In the near future, trains are meant to be faster and have double-deck waggons with a large cross-sectional area. Additionally, tunnels will be single-track and double-tube tunnels and will have a small cross-sectional area for each tube. Because of these developments, this pressure-wave issues must be solved by developing a system to damp these pressure waves. To study the pressure waves in model scale, experiments were done in the tunnel-simulation facility Göttingen (TSG), which is a moving-model rig and was built in 2010. The train used is a model of the German high-speed train ICE 3 in the scale 1 : 25 and the tunnel has a length of 10 m. It can be equipped with an extended portal, which is meant to have an influence on the first compression wave. The train velocity varied from 37 m/s to 46 m/s and the pressure inside the tunnel was measured with piezoresistive pressure transducers. Additionally, high-speed particle image velocimetry (high-speed PIV) was used to study the flow field around the train's nose and inside the tunnel portal. The results of the tests with and without <b>tunnel</b> <b>hood</b> show, that the shape of the hood has a big influence on the slope of the pressure. By adjusting number and size of the vents of the hood, the pressure gradient, which is the important factor for the pressure-depending problems, can be reduced by about 45...|$|E
