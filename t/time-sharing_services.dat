5000|$|In 1968 IBM {{transferred}} its Information marketing Division to SBC. This {{included the}} CALL/360 <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service,</b> QUIKTRAN, BASIC, and DATATEXT (a text processing system similar to ATS).|$|R
5000|$|IBM Business System 12 - An IBM {{industrial}} strength relational DBMS {{influenced by}} ISBL. It {{was developed for}} use by customers of IBM's <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> bureaux in various countries the early 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Informatics still offered <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> {{into the}} early 1980s. [...] Then the Fairfield {{division}}, by that time known as the Data Services Operation, was sold to Mellonics Systems Development, {{a division of the}} Litton Industries conglomerate, in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Although many <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> simply closed, Rapidata held on, {{and became}} part of National Data Corporation. It was still of {{sufficient}} interest in 1982 {{to be the focus}} of [...] "A User's Guide to Statistics Programs: The Rapidata Timesharing System". [...] Even as revenue fell by 66% and National Data subsequently developed its own problems, attempts were made to keep this timesharing business going.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many US and Canadian Universities were {{establishing}} <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> {{on campus and}} needed conversational compiler/interpreters for use in teaching science, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Dartmouth were developing BASIC, but PL/I was a popular choice, as it was concise and easy to teach. As the IBM offerings were unsuitable, a number of schools built their own subsets of PL/I and their own interactive support. Examples are: ...|$|E
5000|$|MTS the <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> {{offered at}} a {{particular}} site, including the MTS software system, the hardware used to run MTS, the staff that supported MTS and assisted end-users, and the associated administrative policies and procedures.|$|R
50|$|TEX {{extended}} the Honeywell <b>Time-Sharing</b> <b>service</b> (TSS) line editor with programmable capabilities which allowed the user greater latitude in developing ease-of-use editing extensions {{as well as}} write scripts to automate many other time-sharing tasks formerly done by more complex TSS FORTRAN programs.|$|R
5000|$|Tymshare {{was founded}} in 1964 as a time sharing company, selling {{computer}} time and software packages for users. [...] It had two SDS/XDS 940 computers; access was via direct dial-up to the computers. In 1968, it purchased Dial Data, another <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> bureau.|$|R
5000|$|Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) {{followed}} a plan {{similar to that}} of National CSS, selling <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> based on the CP/CMS platform. Its focus at the time was in financial services. Varian reports that IDC had [...] "several" [...] S/360-67 systems running CP/CMS and one of IBM's [...] "first relocating S/370", presumably referring to the S/370-145 of 1971, with the first DAT box; but perhaps to the systems announced in 1972 with the [...] "System/370 Advanced Function" [...] announcement, including the S/370-158 and -168.|$|E
5000|$|The firm began life in 1966 as Computer Software Systems, a {{consulting}} firm headed by Bob Bernard. In 1967, joined by Dick Orenstein (one {{of the authors of}} CTSS), the company began exploring the idea of offering <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> based on CP/CMS. After IBM released CP/CMS under the IBM Type-III Library in 1968, and thus became available to CSS, this dream became possible. The small firm persuaded IBM to take an order for a S/360-67, and key technical people were recruited. The machine was delivered in November 1968. Harold Feinleib, an early recruit from MIT, describes the situation: ...|$|E
50|$|Concurrently, {{the company}} {{recruited}} executives who shifted the focus from offering <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services,</b> in which customers wrote their own applications, {{to one that}} was focused on packaged applications. The first of these new executives was Robert Tillson, who left Service Bureau Corporation (then a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation, but originally formed as a division of IBM) to become CompuServe's Executive Vice President of Marketing. He then recruited Charles McCall (who followed Jeff Wilkins as CEO, and later became CEO of medical information firm HBO & Co.), Maury Cox (who became CEO after the departure of McCall), and Robert Massey (who followed Cox as CEO). Barry Berkov was recruited from Xerox to head product development and marketing.|$|E
50|$|IPSA offered APL <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> {{starting}} in 1969. By 1975 the inflexibility and communication error intolerance of Time-division multiplexing {{were no longer}} tolerable. He became the chief architect of the IPSANET packet switching network. In 1976 this system was deployed in North America and London.|$|R
50|$|That same year, Continental {{sold its}} {{directory}} publishing division, its <b>time-share</b> <b>services</b> business, and its credit card authorization business. In {{the midst of}} reorganization in 1985, Napier resigned, and John N. Lemasters, former American Satellite Company president, was named {{president and chief executive}} officer.|$|R
50|$|Tymshare {{was founded}} in 1964 by Tom Oâ€™Rourke and Dave Schmidt as a {{time-sharing}} company, selling computer time and software packages for users. It had two SDS/XDS 940 computers; access was via direct dial-up to the computers. In 1968, it purchased Dial Data, another <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> bureau.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Strassmann {{asserted}} in 1997, that [...] "it {{was never}} clear whether Grosch's Law was {{a reflection of}} how IBM priced its computers or whether it related to actual costs. It provided the rationale that a bigger computer is always better. The IBM sales force used Grosch's rationale to persuade organizations to acquire more computing capacity than they needed. Grosch's Law also became the justification for offering <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> from big data centers {{as a substitute for}} distributed computing." [...] Grosch himself has stated that the law was more useful in the 1960s and 1970s than it is today. He originally intended the law to be a [...] "means for pricing computing services.".|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, several {{companies}} started providing <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> as service bureaus. Early systems used Teletype Model 33 KSR or ASR or Teletype Model 35 KSR or ASR machines in ASCII environments, and IBM Selectric typewriter-based terminals (especially the IBM 2741) with two different seven-bit codes. They would {{connect to the}} central computer by dial-up Bell 103A modem or acoustically coupled modems operating at 10 - 15 characters per second. Later terminals and modems supported 30 - 120 characters per second. The time-sharing system would provide a complete operating environment, including a variety of programming language processors, various software packages, file storage, bulk printing, and off-line storage. Users were charged rent for the terminal, a charge for hours of connect time, a charge for seconds of CPU time, and a charge for kilobyte-months of disk storage.|$|E
50|$|Manugistics {{originated}} in 1969 in Bethesda, Maryland as Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (STSC) {{with some of}} the people who originally implemented APL as a programming language at IBM. Until 1980, the company developed and marketed a broad range of computer software and services, including international computer <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services.</b> In 1980, STSC began developing and marketing a line of operational decision-support software while continuing its other product lines. The company changed its name from STSC, Inc. to Manugistics, Inc. in May 1992. Later it sold the APL compiler business to APL2000 (later APLNow). Continued financial problems starting in 1998, tough competition from vendors of similar software, and the dot-com crash brought about the steady deterioration of Manugistics. After struggling for 9 years, it returned to positive numbers in 2006 and finally was sold off to rival retail-demand-chain software maker JDA Software Group, Inc.|$|E
50|$|The Oregon Trail debuted to Rawitsch's {{class on}} December 3, 1971. Despite bugs, {{the game was}} {{immediately}} popular, and he made it available to others on Minneapolis Public Schools' <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service.</b> When the next semester ended, Rawitsch deleted the program, but he printed out {{a copy of the}} source code.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Honeywell Information Systems {{announced}} a new programming language for their <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> named TEX, an acronym for the Text Executive text processing system. TEX was a first generation scripting language, developed {{around the time of}} AWK and used by Honeywell initially as an in-house system test automation tool.|$|R
5000|$|Compower Ltd., {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of the National Coal Board (later British Coal Corporation) in the UK. Originally National Coal Board (NCB) Computer Services, it became Compower in 1973 providing computing and <b>time-share</b> <b>services</b> to internal NCB users and as a commercial service to external users. Sold to Philips C&P (Communications and Processing) in August 1994.|$|R
50|$|TIES's success, {{and similar}} {{projects}} run by Minneapolis Public Schools and Minnesota State University, Mankato, {{led to the}} founding of MECC in 1973 by the state legislature. As a Joint Powers Authority, {{with the support of}} the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, and the Minnesota Department of Education, MECC's role was to study and coordinate computer use in schools for both administrative and educational purposes. Schools, including the universities, had to get MECC's approval for most computing expenses, and were also its customers for computer-related services. After study of educational needs, a single educational computer center in the Minneapolis area was recommended for use by schools throughout the state (the University of Minnesota's MERITSS computer provided <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services</b> to its campuses and to state universities). MECC hoped that every Minnesota school, regardless of size, would have a terminal connected to the computer center.|$|E
5000|$|Dialcom {{began as}} {{computer}} <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services.</b> A user would sign on using an Teletype Model 33 ASR and a modem with acoustic coupler, running at 110 bps. A command-line interface was available with programming languages such as BASIC and Fortran. The Company grew and evolved quickly over a four-year period {{through a series}} of acquisitions led by Robert F. Ryan, Founder, President and CEO. By 1974 Dialcom was nationwide and offering a number of [...] "off the shelf" [...] products such as accounting and payroll services. Dialcom [...] "reinvented" [...] itself about every four years by coming out with a completely new product line (all related though the thread of telecommunications) to become the dominant leader in whichever area it targeted, while still supporting and growing the prior underlying services. In 1974 Dialcom developed an online word processing and document management suite of products. For one of its major clients, the US House of Representatives, Dialcom supplied a total constituent management system (CRS) to 240 of the 435 House offices. This service was also marketed to associations and large corporations. Four years later Dialcom developed and successfully marketed the first commercial email service in the US and then went international with that service. Mr. Ryan was the sole marketer and negotiator for all international sales that were done at the Ministerial level in each country. In keeping with the corporate philosophy of constant innovation and evolution, during 1980 Dialcom was the creator, designer, developer, computing and network engine of [...] "The Source".|$|E
40|$|Based upon an {{assessment}} of new applications of computer technology and upon reasonable speculation about experimental projects that seem to offer particular promise, this paper considers {{some of the more}} significant developments in computer technology and their possible effects in education in 1980. A. section on hardware discusses some current possibilities and potential uses for large computers and minicomputers and examines the necessity and future of low-cost reliable terminals. The feasibility of extensible higher-level programing languages, a longer range trend toward developing simpler programing languages, and some applications for languages are discussed in a section on software. The final section on systems considers <b>time-sharing</b> <b>services,</b> advances necessary in the communications industry, and computer networks. (Euthor/SH...|$|E

50|$|Tymshare, Inc. was a <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service</b> and {{third-party}} hardware {{maintenance company}} competing with {{companies such as}} Four-Phase Systems, CompuServe, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC, Digital). Tymshare developed or acquired innovative technologies, including data networking (Tymnet), electronic data interchange (EDI), credit card and payment processing (Transaction Tracking System, Western29), telecommunications provisioning (COEES), office automation (August, Augment) and database technology (Magnum). It was headquartered in Cupertino, California from 1964 to 1984.|$|R
50|$|Another major unit of CompuServe, the CompuServe Network Services, {{was formed}} in 1982 to {{generate}} revenue by selling connectivity on the nationwide packet network CompuServe had built to support its <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service.</b> CompuServe designed and manufactured its own network processors, based on the DEC PDP-11, and wrote all the software that ran in the network. Often (and erroneously) called an X.25 network, the CompuServe network implemented a mixture of standardized and proprietary layers throughout the network.|$|R
50|$|In 1968 a {{consulting}} firm called Computer Software Systems used the released version of CP-67 {{to set up a}} commercial <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service.</b> The company's technical team included 2 recruits from MIT (see CTSS above), Dick Orenstein and Harold Feinleib. As it grew, the company renamed itself National CSS and modified the software {{to increase the number of}} paying users it could support until the system was sufficiently different that it warranted a new name, VP/CSS. VP/CSS was the delivery mechanism for National CSS' services until the early 1980s, when it switched to IBM's VM/370 (see below).|$|R
50|$|On January 1, 2012, Fox Movie Channel {{adopted a}} hybrid {{programming}} format, with {{the debut of}} the <b>time-shared</b> <b>service</b> FX Movie Channel (FXM), effectively reviving the channel's original name.

5000|$|In 1965, at the {{instigation}} of Warner Sinback, a {{data network}} {{based on this}} voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, New York, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer <b>time-sharing</b> <b>service,</b> apparently the world's first commercial online service. (In addition to selling GE computers, the centers were computer service bureaus, offering batch processing services. They lost money from the beginning, and Sinback, a high-level marketing manager, was given the job of turning the business around. He decided that a time-sharing system, based on Kemney's work at Dartmouthâ€”which used a computer on loan from GEâ€”could be profitable. Warner was right.) ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} few years {{videotex}} has attracted considerable attention. Unfortunately, but as frequently is the case with novel services that are still evolving, a precise definition of videotex is somewhat difficult to obtain. To some people the term videotex applies {{to a wide variety of}} <b>time-shared</b> computer <b>services</b> for the home and business market, while to others, the term videotex is very specific perhaps best exemplified by the UK Prestel service. In its most narrow and specific meaning, videotex is a subset of online, <b>time-shared</b> computer <b>services.</b> It utilizes the home TV set for display to access a large, central database of frames of general information in colour with graphics. The database is organized in a tree fashion, and the main target is the home market. ...|$|R
