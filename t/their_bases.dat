5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made <b>their</b> <b>bases.</b> Until well into the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E

5|$|On July 5th, French forces re-embarked {{when word}} arrived that a British fleet under Admiral John Byron was approaching. The two fleets battled the next day.

5|$|The Normans {{began to}} make incursions into South Wales from the late 1060s onwards, pushing westwards from <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> in {{recently}} occupied England.

If one builds the right structures in <b>their</b> <b>base</b> (stove, forge, workbench, etc.), they can return there to craft various items, such as weapons, armor, jewelry, clothing, decorations for a Base of Operations, food, and more. Players may use the crafted stuff for themselves, give/trade it with others, or sell it on the market. Once a player gets started with some basic materials and structures in <b>their</b> <b>base,</b> they could theoretically never leave civilization, focusing all of their play on <b>their</b> <b>base,</b> crafting, and selling on the market.|$|R

5|$|The spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical, hyaline (translucent), smooth, and have dimensions of 9–12 by 7–8µm. They are non-amyloid, {{meaning that they}} do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-producing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, measure 38–46 by 3–13µm, and have clamps at <b>their</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, Task Force 90 (CTF-90) {{was inaugurated}} {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Lorenzo Sabin. US {{servicemen}} renovated and transformed cargo vessels and tank carriers to house the thousands of Vietnamese who would be evacuated in them. The repairs were frequently done en route to Haiphong from <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Sabin had no prior involvement in humanitarian matters, and he and his staff prepared Operation Order 2–54—the 114-page policy framework for the operation—in the space of a week during their sea voyage from Japan to Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against <b>their</b> <b>bases.</b> During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the Alliance hires Katarn again, {{this time}} to {{investigate}} an assault on one of <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> by {{a new type of}} Imperial soldier. His investigation reveals the Imperial Dark Trooper project, led by Human General Rom Mohc (Jack Angel). His mission to stop the project takes him to the sewers of Anoat City on planet Anoat, where he captures Moff Rebus, an Imperial weapons specialist Human who developed the Dark Trooper weapon. Rebus' interrogation leads Katarn to a weapons research facility in the mountains of Fest and the Gromas mines where minerals are extracted for the Dark Troopers.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{began to}} make incursions into South Wales from the late-1060s onwards, pushing westwards from <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> in {{recently}} occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles, frequently on old Roman sites, for example those at Cardiff, Pevensey and Portchester, {{and the creation of}} regional lordships. Reusing former Roman sites in this way produced considerable savings in the manpower required to construct the large earth fortifications of the early castles.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic {{containing}} {{plans for}} a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of Konteradmiral (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender's 2nd BS, including Monarch and her sister ships, Orion and Conqueror, and Beatty's four battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} {{operation}} was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants. South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO guerillas {{to leave the country}} unhindered. Nine assembly points were established by the UN, with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each. Six of the assembly points (APs) were led by Australians: Captain Richard Bradshaw (contingent signals officer) at AP Charlie (Ruacana), Sergeant Kerry Ponting (Squadron workshop) at AP Foxtrot (Oshikango), Captain Mark Hender (Squadron Operations Officer) at AP Juliet (Okankolo), Lieutenant Stephen Alexander (Field troop commander) at AP Delta (Beacon 7, west of Oshikango), Lieutenant Mark Broome (Plant Troop Officer) AP Bravo (Ruacana) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry (Liaison Officer) AP Kilo (Oshikuku). Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny. The intention of {{the operation}} was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points. They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> of confinement, but the operation was unsuccessful. Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points; for the most part, they withdrew across the border by walking independently. It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia, absorbed into the local community. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> from 26 April; in effect, hostilities ended after that date.|$|E
