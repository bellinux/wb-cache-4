5000|$|Poo-Pourri (stylized as Poo~Pourri) is a {{fragrance}} {{company that}} develops and markets deodorising <b>toilet</b> <b>sprays.</b> The company's products {{consist of a}} blend of essential oils and other natural compounds claimed by the manufacturer to create a protective film {{on the surface of}} the water in a toilet bowl that keeps odors contained. Poo~Pourri is most noted for its YouTube viral advertisement, entitled [...] "Girls Don't Poop" [...] starring Bethany Woodruff.|$|E
50|$|Lenth√©ric, Inc. is a {{manufacturer}} of perfumes, cosmetics, <b>toilet</b> preparations, hair <b>spray,</b> and shampoo.|$|R
5000|$|Some Eau de toilette {{were once}} {{considered}} restorative skin toners with medical benefits. The journal Medical Record reported in 1905 that a <b>toilet</b> water <b>spray</b> restores energies lost in business, social, and domestic situations. During the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries {{a type of}} toilet water called [...] "plague waters" [...] was supposed to drive away the bubonic plague.|$|R
5000|$|The Loogun is an {{alternative}} to the <b>toilet</b> brush. It <b>sprays</b> a powerful jet of clean water that washes away stubborn marks both above and below the water line. The device never touches the toilet, so the device stays hygienic and safe for children.|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "paperless" [...] {{toilet seat}} {{was invented in}} Japan in 1980. A <b>spray</b> <b>toilet</b> seat, {{commonly}} known by Toto's trademark Washlet, is typically a combination of seat warmer, bidet and drier, controlled by an electronic panel or remote control next to the toilet seat. A nozzle placed at rear of the toilet bowl aims a water jet to the anus and serves the purpose of cleaning. Many models have a separate [...] "bidet" [...] function aimed towards the front for feminine cleansing. The <b>spray</b> <b>toilet</b> seat is common only in Western-style toilets, and is not incorporated in traditional style squat toilets. Some modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid language problems, and most newer models have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless someone {{is sitting on the}} toilet.|$|R
50|$|The <b>toilet</b> cleaner is <b>sprayed</b> {{around the}} rim and the bowl of the toilet prior {{to the use of}} the toilet brush. The toilet brush is used to scrub at the toilet, {{removing}} stubborn stains, and residue biological debris. In recent times, automatic toilet bowl cleaners that clip onto the rim of the toilet and clean with every flush, have become more prevalent.|$|R
30|$|These include {{systems that}} divert gray water for outdoor {{landscape}} irrigation, for toilet flushing and systems that divert gray water to treatment wetlands. This {{is perhaps the}} simplest form of gray water reuse, mostly from the laundry or bathroom sinks to a subsurface garden irrigation system or <b>toilet</b> flushing. <b>Spraying</b> gray water for irrigation is not recommended as it may {{come in contact with}} humans. These techniques are mostly gravity based without the use of any electricity. This involves very low capital and maintenance, and there is no storage involved which increases the risk of microbial growth. However, these systems does not kill or reduce the disease causing pathogens that may be present thereby limiting the option for reuse.|$|R
5000|$|At {{demonstration}} speech day {{for their}} fourth grade class, George Beard and Harold Hutchins show {{off a new}} prank of theirs, the [...] "Squishy". The idea is to place two ketchup packets under a toilet seat so the next person {{who sits on the}} <b>toilets</b> gets ketchup <b>sprayed</b> all over the back of their legs (or the front, if they push down the toilet seat while standing in front of it). Everyone wants to try it out, but before they can do so, Melvin Sneedly, the class tattletale and nerd, forces everyone to watch his demonstration before they leave, which is a machine that combines objects called the Combine-o-Tron 2000. Using his hamster, Sulu, and a robotic hamster body that he built, Melvin combines the two, making Sulu a bionic hamster. Melvin tries to order Sulu to do some tricks for the class, but Sulu refuses to obey Melvin, acting like a normal hamster. Melvin threatens to physically punish Sulu with a ping pong paddle. The hamster uses his new bionic abilities and defensively uses the ping-pong paddle to spank Melvin himself. Melvin yells that he doesn't want Sulu anymore and runs off screaming as a result. Everyone, excited to try out the new prank, including Ms. Ribble, runs behind shouting [...] "Squishies!" [...] After noticing the scene, George and Harold adopt Sulu, who happily joins the two.|$|R
