30|$|In the ERA of PPPs, {{biocides}} {{and chemical}} substances, but not GMOs, acceptability thresholds for toxicity/exposure ratios {{are commonly used}} as <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> for lower tier testing (laboratory testing).

40|$|Salinisation of {{freshwater}} {{has been identified}} as a serious environmental issue in Australia and around the world. Protective concentrations (<b>trigger</b> <b>values)</b> for salinity can be used to manage salinity impacts, though require locally relevant salinity tolerance information. 72 -h acute salinity tolerance values were determined for 102 macroinvertebrates collected from 11 locations in four biologically distinct freshwater bio-regions in Northeast Australia and compared with sensitivities observed in Southeast Australia. The salinity tolerance of individual taxa was consistent across Northeast Australia and between Northeast and Southeast Australia. However, two distinct communities were identified in Northeast Australia using distributions of the acute tolerance values and a calculated index of salinity sensitivity. Salinity <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> should therefore be representative of local or regionally relevant communities and may be adequately calculated using sensitivity values from throughout Eastern Australia.

We propose a method to model {{the impact of a}} policy change on investment behavior in which, contrary to the earlier models based on Poisson processes, uncertainty concerning the moment of the change can be explicitly accounted for. Moreover, probabilities of the change depend {{on the state of the}} dynamic system, what ensures the consistency of the action of the policy maker. We model the policy change as an upward jump in the (net) investment cost, which is, for instance, caused by a reduction in the investment tax credit. The firm has an incomplete information concerning the <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> of the process for which the jump occurs. We derive the optimal investment rule maximizing the value of the firm. It is shown that the impact of <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty is non-monotonic: the investment threshold decreases with the <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty for low levels of uncertainty, while the reverse is true for high uncertainty levels.

30|$|The {{interpretation}} of triggers is handled by different adaptation layers. In general, an adaptation layer is a process, {{or part of}} a process, that is able to interface with the trigger communication module and thereby receive triggers. In the context of opportunistic networking, <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> are likely to represent some sort of cross-layer information. The role of the adaptation layer is then to work as an interface between the trigger communication module and the upper layer consumer of cross-layer information. Applications and protocol implementations may use cross-layer information in different ways and the information may take different formats. It {{is the role of}} the adaptation layer to reshape the semantics-free <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> contained in the triggers into the specific type of cross-layer information that is used by the application or protocol that is being evaluated. In the next section, we describe an adaptation layer for the DTN 2 reference implementation [27], which interprets the <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> (1 or 2) as connectivity information (link up or down) and interfaces with the link discovery mechanism within the DTN 2 implementation.|$|R

40|$|To {{screen for}} {{hormonal}} activity in water samples, highly sensitive in vitro CALUX bioassays are available which allow detection of estrogenic (ERα), androgenic (AR), progestagenic (PR), and glucocorticoid (GR) activities. This paper presents <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> for the ERα, AR, PR, and GR CALUX bioassays for agonistic hormonal activities in (drinking) water, which define a level above which human health risk cannot be waived a priori and additional examination of specific endocrine activity may be warranted. The <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> {{are based on}} 1) acceptable or tolerable daily intake (ADI/TDI) values of specific compounds, 2) pharmacokinetic factors defining their bioavailability, 3) estimations of the bioavailability of unknown compounds with equivalent hormonal activity, 4) relative endocrine potencies, and 5) physiological, and drinking water allocation factors. As a result, <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> of 3. 8 ng 17 β-estradiol (E 2) -equivalents (eq) /L, 11 ng dihydrotestosterone (DHT) -eq/L, 21 ng dexamethasone (DEX) -eq/L, and 333 ng Org 2058 -eq/L were derived. Benchmark Quotient (BQ) values were derived by dividing hormonal activity in water samples by the derived trigger using the highest concentrations detected in a recent, limited screening of Dutch water samples, and {{were in the order}} of (value) AR (0. 41) > ERα (0. 13) > GR (0. 06) > PR (0. 04). The application of <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> derived in the present study can help to judge measured agonistic hormonal activities in water samples using the CALUX bioassays and help to decide whether further examination of specific endocrine activity followed by a subsequent safety evaluation may be warranted, or whether concentrations of such activity are of low priority with respect to health concerns in the human population. For instance, at one specific drinking water production site ERα and AR (but no GR and PR) activities were detected in drinking water, however, these levels are at least a factor 83 smaller than the respective <b>trigger</b> <b>values,</b> and therefore no human health risks are to be expected from hormonal activity in Dutch drinking water from this site...|$|R

The policy change occurs when a stochastic process describing the state of the economic environment reaches a certain trigger. The firm has incomplete information about the trigger and knows only its probability distribution. Consequently, both the firm's conjecture concerning the <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> as well as the precision of this conjecture serve as input parameters. We derive the optimal investment rule maximizing the value of the firm and show that the impact of the <b>trigger</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty on the optimal investment threshold is non-monotonic: the threshold decreases with uncertainty for its low levels, while the reverse is true if uncertainty is high. Furthermore, we provide results concerning the valuation of the firm's investment opportunity and present some policy implications...|$|E
40|$|Cell-based bioassays are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in water quality assessment. The new generations of reporter-gene assays are very sensitive and effects are often detected in very clean water types such as drinking water and recycled water. For monitoring applications it is therefore imperative to derive <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> that differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable effect levels. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a statistical method to read directly across from chemical guideline <b>values</b> to <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> without the need to perform in vitro to in vivo extrapolations. The derivation is based on matching effect concentrations with existing chemical guideline values and filtering out appropriate chemicals that are responsive in the given bioassays at concentrations {{in the range of}} the guideline values. To account for the mixture effects of many chemicals acting together in a complex water sample, we propose bioanalytical equivalents that integrate the effects of groups of chemicals with the same mode of action that act in a concentration-additive manner. Statistical distribution methods are proposed to derive a specific effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalent concentration (EBT-BEQ) for each bioassay of environmental interest that targets receptor-mediated toxicity. Even bioassays that are indicative of the same mode of action have slightly different numeric <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> due to differences in their inherent sensitivity. The algorithm was applied to 18 cell-based bioassays and 11 provisional effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalents were derived as an illustrative example using the 349 chemical guideline values protective for human health of the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. We illustrate the applicability using the example of a diverse set of water samples including recycled water. Most recycled water samples were compliant with the proposed triggers while wastewater effluent would not have been compliant with a few. The approach is readily adaptable to any water type and guideline or regulatory framework and can be expanded from the protection goal of human health to environmental protection targets. While this work constitutes a proof of principle, the applicability remains limited at present due to insufficient experimental bioassay data on individual regulated chemicals and the derived effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> are of course only provisional. Once the experimental database is expanded and made more robust, the proposed effect-based <b>trigger</b> <b>values</b> may provide guidance in a regulatory context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
