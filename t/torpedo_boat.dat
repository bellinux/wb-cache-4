The British had few casualties and little damage to their vessels. The battle influenced the tactics and deployments of the remaining German <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> flotillas in the North Sea area, as the loss shook the faith of their commanders in the effectiveness of the force.|$|E

5|$|In October 1916, the Flanders Flotilla {{was finally}} {{reinforced}} by the German Admiralty with two full <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> flotillas. The transfer of the 3rd and 9th <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> Flotillas to Flanders had immediate consequences to {{the balance of power}} in the Dover Strait. Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats and several of the smaller inferior A-class torpedo boats, they now possessed 23large torpedo boats capable of meeting the British Dover Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E

Some <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> were refitted steam launches; others, such as the CSS David class, were purpose-built. The <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> tried to attack under cover of night by ramming the spar torpedo into the hull of the blockading ship, then backing off and detonating the explosive. The <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> were not very effective and were easily countered by simple measures such as hanging chains over the sides of ships to foul the screws of the <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats,</b> or encircling the ships with wooden booms to trap the torpedoes at a distance.|$|R
