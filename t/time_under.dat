5000|$|The US has had {{public debt}} since its inception. Debts {{incurred}} during the American Revolutionary War {{and under the}} Articles of Confederation led to the first yearly report {{on the amount of}} the debt ($75,463,476.52 on January 1, 1791). Every president since Harry Truman has added to the national debt. The debt ceiling has been raised 74 times since March 1962, including 18 <b>times</b> <b>under</b> Ronald Reagan, eight <b>times</b> <b>under</b> Bill Clinton, seven <b>times</b> <b>under</b> George W.

5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} <b>time</b> <b>under</b> the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E

5|$|After some {{territorial}} disputes, {{war broke}} out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Raška, {{and the city of}} Dubrovnik, at that <b>time</b> <b>under</b> Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the siege is also not known exactly.|$|E
5|$|After three seasons, Muhsin {{left the}} club and Jamal Salih became the new manager, leading the team to {{promotion}} in the 1974–75 season. He introduced some players from Montakhab Jameaat Baghdad, who won the 1975 Universities League, to strengthen the team. After finishing eighth in 1976, Al-Talaba were the runners-up in the 1976–77 season, five points behind the league leaders, Al-Zawra'a. Halfway through the 1977–78 season, on 27 December 1977, the club was dissolved and then refounded as the same club but this <b>time</b> <b>under</b> the name of Al-Talaba, which translates to The Students. They finished eighth in that season.|$|E
5|$|Another failed product, this <b>time</b> <b>under</b> Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers {{that featured}} a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that <b>time</b> <b>under</b> review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this <b>time,</b> <b>under</b> Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech until much later in their lives.|$|E

The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal box at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{returned}} to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this <b>time</b> <b>under</b> {{the command of}} Tettius Julianus, and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished. An attack on the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that <b>time</b> <b>under</b> the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E

5|$|Following Mazzone's sacking in {{the summer}} of 1996 and the {{departure}} of Giannini, Totti was expected to play a more prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996–97 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing <b>time</b> <b>under</b> new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma's chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.|$|E
