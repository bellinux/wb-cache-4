5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished more than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> {{the previous two}} centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was stopped in 2001, the {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} {{the second phase of the}} building used a fixed-price design and build contract, which meant that the National Assembly had a much tighter control of costs than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the first phase.|$|E

5|$|After fifth-place {{finishes}} in 1968 and 1969 (the latter {{in the newly}} created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth {{by the end of}} their campaign with a record of 79–76.|$|E
5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes {{the new head of}} the Zin Empire.|$|E

5|$|All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts {{produced}} until December 2011, {{including all}} Amperas in stock at European dealerships, {{were scheduled to}} receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E
5|$|For another week, North Korean {{divisions}} launched all {{the troops}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> massed {{attacks against the}} ROK and US lines. Their attacks, which usually occurred at night and were supported by armor and artillery, advanced with infantry and tanks in close support of one another. Each North Korean attack ran into well-established UN lines, where US tanks, mines and entrenched infantry were positioned to counter them. Strikes by US aircraft ravaged the attacking North Koreans. The fighting was fierce with many casualties on both sides, particularly where the North and South Koreans fought one another. The repeated attacks eventually broke and pushed back the North Korean forces. They continued their push against the Pusan Perimeter until they were outflanked in the Battle of Inchon.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, some teams opted to keep the same line-up as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the {{previous}} season; however, some teams changed drivers. One of the main changes involved the début appearance of Jaguar in the sport with the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix champion Adam Carroll and the 2012 GP3 Series title winner Mitch Evans competing for the team. Team Aguri was purchased by Chinese sports development and management firm SECA during the previous season and was renamed Techeetah with Jean-Éric Vergne and Ma Qinghua announced as the team's drivers. Defending FIA GT World Cup champion Maro Engel was hired by Venturi to replace World Endurance Championship driver Mike Conway, while Virgin employed three-time consecutive World Touring Car champion José María López to partner Formula E race winner Sam Bird. The final change involved two-time Macau Grand Prix winner and reigning European Formula Three champion Felix Rosenqvist entering the series with Mahindra and partnering Nick Heidfeld. Defending drivers' champion Sébastien Buemi stayed at e.Dams-Renault after his title-winning campaign, with the Swiss driver again being joined by Nico Prost.|$|E

He suggested that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
