5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E

5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E

25|$|A recent reevaluation of cranial traits {{suggests}} that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Jōmon. This agrees with the reference to the Ainu being a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. A recent genetic study has revealed that the Ainu's closest human relatives are the Ryukyuan people, Yamato people, Taiwanese people and Nivkh.|$|E

This is especially common with applications designed for Unix-like operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a shell script.|$|E

25|$|The Eastern Shore is less populous {{and more}} rural, {{as are the}} {{counties}} of western Maryland. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and Appalachia more than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> rest of Maryland. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as Ocean City, Princess Anne, and Salisbury on the Eastern Shore and Cumberland, Frostburg, and Hancock in Western Maryland.|$|E
25|$|The preeminence of China and India {{as major}} {{manufacturing}} countries with unrealised potential {{has been widely}} recognised, but some commentators state that China's and Russia's large-scale disregard {{for human rights and}} democracy could be a problem in the future. Human rights issues do not inform the foreign policies of these two countries to the same extent as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> policies of other large states such as Japan, India, the EU states and the United States. There is also the possibility of conflict over Taiwan in the case of China, or Ukraine in the case of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide {{from one side to the}} other.

In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, and the rest of the year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”). Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E

25|$|The sector's {{data may}} be {{outdated}} and {{not reflect the}} current media contents, because not all operating systems update or use this sector, and even if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> contents is not valid when the medium has been ejected without properly unmounting the volume or after a power-failure. Therefore, operating systems should first inspect a volume's optional shutdown status bitflags residing in the FAT entry of cluster 1 or the FAT32 EBPB at offset 0x041 and ignore the data stored in the FS information sector, if these bitflags indicate that the volume was not properly unmounted before. This does not cause any problems other than a possible speed penalty for the first free space query or data cluster allocation; see fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all {{discrimination based on}} price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can do to change it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
500|$|Throughout a game, {{the referee}} and {{linesmen}} {{have a role}} in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc. Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by [...] "common sense", according to officials.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented.
