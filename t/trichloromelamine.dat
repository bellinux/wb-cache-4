40|$|Magnesium/N-halogen organic {{cell systems}} are {{considered}} attractive among {{the family of}} primary battery devices due to their higher cell voltage (> 2. 45 V) in aqueous electrolyte and also {{to the fact that}} hey are pollution-free. The corrosion rates of the anodes have been calculated and the trend obtained with respect to he chosen N-halogen organic compounds is as follows: N,N '-dichlorodimethylhydantoin (DDH) > trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCIA) > dichlorosocyanuric acid (DCIA) > <b>trichloromelamine</b> (TCM). These results are qualitatively supported by scanning electron microscopy measurements. In recent years, battery systems using organic compounds as cathode active material have raised considerable interest due to their high energy density and voltage stability. ~' 2 Conventional inor-ganic depolarizers can undergo reduction involving nly one ortwo electron transfers while organic depolarizers like aromatic nitro compounds can transfer up to twelve electrons during the electro-chemical reduction processes. 3 ' 4 However, these nitro compounds suffer from a variety of disadvantages: low cathode potential, low power density, and high toxicity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{research on}} the synthesis and characterization of extended heptazine-based, graphite-like carbon nitride materials (CNx), as well as molecular heptazine (C 6 N 7) derivatives. Spurred on by recent triazine to heptazine conversion studies, a structural examination was performed on an amorphous nitrogen-rich carbon nitride material formed via the rapid and exothermic self-propagating decomposition of a triazine (C 3 N 3) precursor, <b>trichloromelamine</b> (TCM). The thermally stable and insoluble CNxHy product {{was determined to be}} composed of heptazine repeat units. This conclusion was supported by 13 C solid state NMR and isolation of molecular heptazine anions after base hydrolysis (structural deconstruction) of the CNxHy material. Modifications to the decomposition of TCM were explored. Introduction of a solid template (NaCl or silica) led to morphological changes in the TCM-CNx product, observed by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the sodium salts, NaBr and NaN 3, led to chloride exchange with TCM. The use of mixtures of NH 4 Cl and NaN 3 also showed changes in the morphology of the material, while leading to slight changes in th...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the major}} public health problem of {{illnesses}} caused by foodborne pathogens, an efficient disinfecting method is needed during food processing. In an experiment to determine the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, two disinfectants, <b>trichloromelamine</b> (TCM) and ozone, were compared. Samples of beef were separately inoculated with Escherichia coli and coliforms, Salmonella typhimurium, and Campylobacter jejuni. Infected meat samples were each sprayed with TCM and ozone to kill the bacteria. After incubation, meat samples were either swabbed or bacteria on the meat were rubbed off into sterile deionized water. Dilutions of collected bacterial samples were plated for counting. Beef samples infected with E. coli and coliforms treated with TCM had an 82. 3 % decrease in coliforms and a 98. 2 % decrease in E. coli, while ozone did not kill the bacteria. Beef samples infected with S. typhimurium showed a 61. 3 % decrease in pathogens when treated with ozone and no decrease when treated with TCM. Samples infected with C. jejuni showed a 100 % decrease when treated with TCM and a 68. 5 % decrease when treated with ozone. Conflicting results {{made it difficult to}} determine which antimicrobial is best, although TCM may be more effective, so further testing is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{reclaimed}} {{water systems}} is increasing {{the need for}} easy-to-use and cost effective disinfectants available for consumer application. This study looked at efficacy of three disinfectants, <b>trichloromelamine</b> (TCM), ozone, and acetic acid, {{and their ability to}} reduce number of pathogens. Four samples of TCM were tested in a 10 mL contaminated water to 1 mL TCM solution ratio, plated for both total plate counts and to check for generic E. coli. It was observed that TCM 3 was able to give a 92. 54 percent reduction of E. coli and was the only sample able to kill the E. coli that was present in the water. The other TCM solutions had percent reductions of, TCM 1 : 98. 77, TCM 2 : 97. 34, and TCM 4 : 87. 64. Similar tests were conducted with ozone and mixtures. Ozonated brine water, and ozone mixed with acetic acid were both 100 % effective at reducing bacterial load in the water samples (99. 98 and 100 %, respectively). The ozone was not as effective, with 85. 7 % reduction. These results indicate that TCM and ozone could be effective tools for consumer use to disinfect water holding tanks.

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge {{in the number of}} people using {{reclaimed}} water systems for personal use. Because of this, it is getting more and more important for easy-to-use and cost effective disinfectants on the market for consumer application. This study looked at the efficacy of three disinfectants, <b>trichloromelamine,</b> ozone and acetic acid, for their ability to reduce the number of waterborne pathogens. Four samples of TCM were tested in a 10 mL contaminated water: 1 mL TCM solution ratio and plated for both total plate counts and to check for generic E. coli. It was found that one of the four samples of TCM (TCM 3) was able to not only give a percent reduction of 92. 54 %, but it also killed the E. coli that was present in the water. TCM 1 had an average percent reduction of 98. 77, TCM 2 's percent reduction was 97. 34, and TCM 4 's: 87. 64. This was not the most effective disinfectant, however. Similar tests were done with ozone, ozone that was mixed with brine water, and ozone that was mixed with acetic acid, as well as pure acetic acid. Ozonated brine water, and ozone mixed with acetic acid were both nearly 100 % effective at reducing bacterial load in the water samples (99. 989 and 100 %, respectively). The pure ozone was not nearly as effective, with a percent reduction of 85. 7 %. These results indicate that TCM and ozone could possibly be effective tools for the consumer to use to disinfect water holding tanks, however, more testing needs to be done in order to find out exactly how effective these products are in the long term, as well as to find the contact time needed for effective kill by TCM...|$|E

Spurred on by recent triazine to heptazine conversion studies, a structural examination was performed on an amorphous nitrogen–rich carbon nitride material formed via the rapid and exothermic self-propagating decomposition of a triazine (C 3 N 3) precursor, <b>trichloromelamine</b> (TCM). The thermally stable and insoluble CNxHy product {{was determined to be}} composed of heptazine repeat units. This conclusion was supported by 13 C solid state NMR and isolation of molecular heptazine anions after base hydrolysis (structural deconstruction) of the CNxHy material. Modifications to the decomposition of TCM were explored. Introduction of a solid template (NaCl or silica) led to morphological changes in the TCM–CNx product, observed by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the sodium salts, NaBr and NaN 3, led to chloride exchange with TCM. The use of mixtures of NH 4 Cl and NaN 3 also showed changes in the morphology of the material, while leading to slight changes in the IR spectra. A series of reactions between NaBH 4 and TCM yield novel thermally stable boron carbon nitride (BCN) materials. Reactions between TCM and Li 2 C 2 or aromatic organic solids led to CNx materials with increased carbon contents. Crystalline metal–heptazine precipitates were generated by cation exchange reaction with the base hydrolysis product of TCM–CNx, potassium cyamelurate. A structure solution was attempted for the crystalline copper cyamelurate salt, KCu[C 6 N 7 O 3]· 4 H 2 O. Neutral molecular heptazines were also synthesized; these species included 2, 5, 8 –tribromo–s–heptazine (TBH), 2, 5, 8 –triphenyl–s–heptazine (TPH), 2, 5, 8 –tris(diisopropylamino) –s–heptazine (TAmH), and 2 –bis(trimethylsilyl) amido– 5, 8 –dichloroheptazine (DCAH). These materials were sublimable and showed interesting optical absorption and emission properties. A polymeric heptazine material was synthesized by thermal decomposition of DCAH. Several attempts were made to synthesize polymeric materials from heptazine precursors. Extended solids with C 6 N 8 and C 9 N 7 stoichiometry were made through solid state metathesis reactions between trichloroheptazine and either lithium nitride or lithium carbide. Powder X–ray diffraction indicated that salt formation was occurring during these reactions and products had the desired stoichiometry by elemental analysis. It was generally observed that CNx materials containing excess carbon displayed increased thermal stability when compared to pure CNx...|$|E
