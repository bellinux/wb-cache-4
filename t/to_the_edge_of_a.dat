5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace. The United States agrees to stop Volgin's renegade faction, destroy the stolen Shagohod and eliminate the American defector, The Boss.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, {{which was a}} common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering {{which would make it}} possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car {{at the start of the}} game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E

50|$|In an {{adaptive}} system, a parameter changes slowly {{and has no}} preferred value. In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends {{on the history of}} the system dynamics”. One of the most important qualities of self-adjusting systems is its “adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos” or ability to avoid chaos. Practically speaking, by heading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster. A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications. Physicists have shown that adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.|$|R

25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor laser housed within the CD player, through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any CD player. This swing arm allows the laser to read information from the centre <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disc, without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.|$|E
25|$|The result {{obtained}} for R depends {{only on the}} ratio E/V0. This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability of reflection regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, we seem to predict that when a marble rolls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> table, there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the step function is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability of reflection approaches zero in the limit , where k is the wavenumber of the particle.|$|E

500|$|Oxford {{had left}} a small reserve of pike-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some {{critical}} time. The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping {{him away from the}} Yorkist king. On seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move. He led his men into the fight at Henry's side. Outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back. Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> marsh. The king's horse lost its footing and toppled into it. Richard gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: [...] "God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one." [...] In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir Percival Thirlwall—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed. It is likely that James Harrington also died in the charge. The king's trusted advisor Richard Ratcliffe was also slain.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, the party {{struggled}} to ascend the inland ice over a treacherous surface with many hidden crevasses. The weather was generally bad; on one occasion all progress was halted for three days by violent storms and continuous rain. On 26 August Nansen {{concluded that there was}} now no chance of reaching Christianhaab by mid-September, when the last ship was due to leave. He therefore ordered a change of course, almost due west towards Godthaab (now Nuuk), a shorter journey by at least [...] The rest of the party, according to Nansen, [...] "hailed the change of plan with acclamation". They continued climbing, until on 11 September they had reached a height of [...] above sea level, the summit of the icecap with temperatures dropping to [...] at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier, although the terrain was difficult and the weather remained hostile. Progress was slow because of fresh snowfalls which made dragging the sledges as hard as pulling them through sand. By 26 September they had battled their way down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fjord that ran westward towards Godthaab. From their tent, some local willows and parts of the sledges Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat, and on 29 September Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey, rowing down the fjord. [...] Four days later, on 3 October 1888, they reached Godthaab, where they were greeted by the town's Danish representative. His first words were to inform Nansen that he had been awarded his doctorate, a matter that [...] "could not have been more remote from my thoughts at that moment". The crossing had been accomplished in 49 days, making 78 days in total since they had left the Jason; throughout the journey the team had maintained careful meteorological, geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior. The rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October.|$|E
