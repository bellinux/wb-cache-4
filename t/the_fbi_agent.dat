5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} {{would be about}} pool hustling, however as writing ensued, the script went through several incarnations until the Simpsons writers settled on the grifting story seen in the episode.

They said that he implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders during the questioning and was beginning to write a formal statement when he asked {{to take a break}} and then suddenly attacked <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agent.</b> Todashev was shot multiple times and killed by the officers.|$|E
25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations on the crime expired in 1996 and no one can be prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agent</b> in charge of the investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} and second season, the search for Laura Palmer's killer served as the engine for the plot, and {{captured}} the public's imagination, although the creators admitted this was largely a MacGuffin; each episode was really about the interactions between the townsfolk. The unique (and often bizarre) personalities of each citizen formed a web of minutiae that ran contrary to the town's quaint appearance. Adding to the surreal atmosphere was the recurrence of Dale Cooper's dreams, in which <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>agent</b> is given clues to Laura's murder in a supernatural realm {{that may or may not}} be of his imagination. The first season contained only eight episodes (including the two-hour pilot episode), and was considered technically and artistically revolutionary for television at the time, and geared toward reaching the standards of film.|$|E
