5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite marks on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, {{indicating that the}} animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E

25|$|It {{is argued}} that Jesus was of Middle Eastern descent because of the {{geographic}} location of the events described in the Gospels, and, among some modern Christian scholars, the genealogy ascribed to him. For this reason, he has been portrayed as an olive-skinned individual typical of the Levant region. In 2001, a new {{attempt was made to}} discover what the true race and face of Jesus might have been. The study, sponsored by the BBC, France 3 and Discovery Channel, used one of three 1st-century Jewish skulls from a leading department of forensic science in Israel. A face was constructed using forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at the University of Manchester. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> Neave constructed suggested that Jesus would have had a broad face and large nose, and differed significantly from the traditional depictions of Jesus in renaissance art.|$|E
25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|E

Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation.

Using one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a forensic science department in Israel, a clay model is created through forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at Manchester University. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> Neave constructs suggests that Jesus {{would have had a}} broad face and large nose, and differs significantly from his traditional depictions in renaissance art. Additional information about Jesus's skin colour and hair is provided by Goodacre.

He also suggests that Jesus would have had short, curly hair and a short cropped beard.|$|E

500|$|Dragonflies are {{hemimetabolous}} insects; they do {{not have}} a pupal stage and undergo an incomplete metamorphosis with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges. Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice, while other eggs are the size of a pinhead, ellipsoidal, or nearly spherical. A clutch may have as many as 1500 eggs, and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymphs or naiads which moult between six and 15 times (depending on species) as they grow. Most of a dragonfly's life is spent as a nymph, beneath the water's surface. The nymph extends its hinged labium (a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible, which is sometimes termed as a [...] "mask" [...] as it is normally folded and held before <b>the</b> <b>face)</b> <b>that</b> can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such as mosquito larvae, tadpoles, and small fish.

40|$|When we {{see someone}} change their {{direction}} of gaze, we spontaneously follow their eyes because we {{expect people to}} look at interesting objects. Bayliss and Tipper (2006) examined the consequences of observing this expectancy being either confirmed or violated by faces producing reliable or unreliable gaze cues. Participants viewed different <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> would consistently look at the target, or consistently look away from <b>the</b> target: <b>The</b> <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> consistently looked towards targets were subsequently chosen as being more trustworthy than <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> consistently looked away from targets. The current work demonstrates that these gaze contingency effects are only detected when faces create a positive social context by smiling, but not in the negative context when all <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> held angry or neutral expressions. These data suggest that implicit processing of the reward contingencies associated with gaze cues relies on a positive emotional expression to maintain expectations of a favourable outcome of joint attention episodes...|$|R

2500|$|Her beauty {{inspired}} {{artists of}} all time to represent her, frequently as the personification of ideal beauty. Christopher Marlowe's lines from his tragedy Doctor Faustus (1604) are frequently cited: [...] "Was this <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> launch'd a thousand ships/And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?" [...] However, in the play this meeting and the ensuing temptation are not unambiguously positive, closely preceding death and descent to Hell. Images of her start appearing in the 7th century BC. In classical Greece, her abduction by Paris—or elopement with him—was a popular motif. In medieval illustrations, this event was frequently portrayed as a seduction, whereas in Renaissance painting it is usually depicted as a rape by Paris. The fact that the terms rape and elopement were often used interchangeably lends ambiguity to the legend.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University {{has argued}} that the smile is mostly drawn in low spatial frequencies, and so can best be seen from a {{distance}} or with one's peripheral vision.

[...] Christopher Tyler and Leonid Kontsevich of the Smith-Kettlewell Institute in San Francisco believe that the changing nature of the smile is caused by variable levels of random noise in the human visual system.
