5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} criticized for not fully {{utilizing}} many of the features of the Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed. The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised to be coming later.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{during the}} 15th {{anniversary of the}} game's release, Square Enix (who had {{acquired}} Eidos earlier) endorsed a free fan-created mod, Deus Ex: Revision which was released through Steam. The mod, created by Caustic Creative, is a graphical overhaul of the original game, adding in support for newer versions of DirectX, improving the <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> the soundtrack from the original game, and adding in more world-building aesthetics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{proposed}} an automatic nonlinear texture-cartoon decomposition {{based on the}} frequency behavior of <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> cartoon across different scales. We measured the ratio of gradient magnitude across modulation domain components and used this ratio to classify the <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> cartoon pixels. The algorithm computed the modulation do-main component where <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> cartoon are separated. Our simulation {{results showed that the}} proposed algorithm is able to extract meaningful <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> cartoon components from images efficiently.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> color features applied to natural image retrieval. Natural images usually contain both <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> color, and therefore those features should also be considered together in a retrieval process. Combination of <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> color features is important, since it may result in closer connection to semantic. The idea {{in this study is}} to empirically evaluate the effect of <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> color features to the query. Retrieval capability of those features is first evaluated separately and finally the combined effect is studied. Finally, the goal is to find out what kind of features, or combination of features, yield the most successful results for certain types of query images. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine and}} model the bit rate variability-distortion (VD) curve of MPEG– 4 Part 2 VBR video encodings, which has {{applications}} for optimal statistical multiplexing of {{low bit rate}} streaming video. We show that the concave VD curve shape at high compression ratios or large quantization scales, is influenced by both the <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> the motion information. We use linear and quadratic models for the <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> motion bits statistics and devise accurate VD curve models. The model parameters are obtained from statistics that are estimated from two encodings. This work extends our previous work on piecewise models of the VD curve. The <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> motion based VD model based on two encodings has comparable accuracy to a piecewise model based on three encodings. In addition, the <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> motion based VD model provides fundamental insights into how <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> motion affects traffic variability...|$|R
5|$|The game {{features}} several technical improvements over Dark Forces II, including colored lighting, new <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> models, {{and improved}} artificial intelligence.

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality <b>textures,</b> <b>and</b> updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the relationship betweensynthetic aperture radar image <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> operational forestry parameters. Two other related issues were also investigated: the value of speckle-filtering before measuring the <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> which <b>texture</b> measure (Markov random field texture models or gray level co-occurrence texture statistics) characterized the texture the best. It was found that: there exists a weak relationship between synthetic aperture radar image <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> the operational forestry parameters of rainforest on Vancouver Island, speckle-filtering before collecting texture features was not beneficial and that Markov random field <b>texture</b> models <b>and</b> gray level co-occurrence statistics performed equally well...|$|R

5|$|Deathrow is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} by Southend Interactive {{and published by}} Ubisoft Entertainment. It was released as an Xbox gaming system exclusive on 18 October 2002 in Europe and four days later in North America. Deathrow development began in May 1999 as an online PC (player computer) game. In early 2001, Southend transitioned to an Xbox console release, which let the team use pixel shaders, bump mapped <b>textures,</b> <b>and</b> specular lighting. Deathrow was built on an in-house 3D game engine and was Southend's first full release.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music <b>textures,</b> <b>and</b> a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a remastered {{release of}} the first-person shooter video game by the same name. Developed by 4J Studios and {{published}} by Microsoft Game Studios {{a decade after the}} original's 2000 release, the remaster features several technical improvements, including higher resolution <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> models, a higher frame rate, and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live online service. It was released for the Xbox 360 video game console in March 2010, through the Xbox Live Arcade download service. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute organization, as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne.|$|E

5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{was formed}} as the Bobby Boyd Congress in 1970, in homage to their {{original}} vocalist Bobby Boyd. Upon deciding that the funk scene in the United States was too saturated for them to viably compete in, they relocated to France in 1971; with Bobby Boyd splitting from the group to pursue a musical career in America, they renamed themselves 'Soul Congress', then 'Ice'. After regular performances in Paris' Barbès district—an area made up primarily of North African immigrants—they {{caught the eye of}} producer Pierre Jaubert and became the house session band at his Parisound studio. The influence of their surroundings led Ice to increasingly weave African rhyme schemes, <b>textures,</b> <b>and</b> beat tendencies in their original funk style, and as such they changed their name to Lafayette Afro Rock Band following the 1972 release of the poorly produced Each Man Makes His Own Destiny.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{original}} release of God of War III {{was met with}} critical acclaim, God of War III Remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it odd that Sony decided to remaster God of War III for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of God of War II, which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise {{was given to the}} smoother <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> improved frame rate, though because {{the original}} already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

5|$|CIS Vancouver and Pac Title created most of {{the visual}} effects, under the overall {{supervision}} of Michael Owens. CIS' work was headed by Geoff Hancock and Pac Title's by Mark Freund. Each studio created around 90 shots. Pac Title focused primarily on 2D imagery; VICON House of Moves handled the motion capture. The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D modeling package Maya to animate city scenes before rendering them in mental ray; they generated matte paintings in Softimage XSI and Maya, and used Digital Fusion for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse {{with a minimum of}} textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution <b>textures</b> <b>and</b> improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics {{at the touch of a}} control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
