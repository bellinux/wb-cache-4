5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. <b>The</b> <b>ore</b> is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in <b>the</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, the Lake Superior mines {{were running}} out of <b>the</b> {{high-grade}} “direct-shipping” <b>ore.</b> Experiments in concentrating <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> had been ongoing since the 1915.

50|$|Sinter {{roasting}} involves heating <b>the</b> fine <b>ores</b> at high temperatures, where simultaneous oxidation and agglomeration of <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> take place.

The lodes are typical lead-zinc ores; they belong to the sphalerite-pyrite-galena-chalcopyrite association, although in Le Puy chalcopyrite is absent (in neighbouring lodes it is present). <b>The</b> <b>ores</b> most probably were exuded during the cooling process of the Piégut-Pluviers Granodiorite.|$|R
5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of <b>the</b> <b>ore</b> body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of <b>the</b> <b>ore</b> but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. <b>The</b> <b>ore</b> then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of <b>the</b> <b>ore</b> to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. <b>The</b> <b>ore</b> is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

5|$|Partial capping (covering) of the site: <b>The</b> <b>ore</b> body in Iron Mountain was {{determined}} to be shallow, so this alternative was considered. However, the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient, so it was also never implemented.|$|E
40|$|The study investigates {{leaching}} {{of complex}} sulfide ores with simultaneous regeneration of the leaching solution and removal of dissolved iron {{to balance the}} iron concentration in the leaching process. To minimize environmental pollution and obtain high metal extraction from <b>the</b> <b>ores,</b> leaching with a ferric chloride solution is adapted to treat Delta sulfide <b>ores.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results indicate that under high oxygen pressure leaching, oxidation of ferrous ion to ferric ion and partial precipitation of iron from solution can occur simultaneously. However, the findings also indicate that leaching <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> with simultaneous iron precipitation in one operation is difficult. It is better to precipitate excess iron in one stage; then leach <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> in another stage using the regenerated leaching solution...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} description of <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> of Lake Storsjoen was given by Vogt J. H.

In <b>the</b> iron-rich <b>ore,</b> a concentric structure is common of which light brown layers of loose, almost dusty material alternate with hard and brittle black layers, the thickness of each being 0. 5 mm or less. The analyses presented in this paper seem to demonstrate that the composition of <b>the</b> sedimentary <b>ores</b> of Lake Storsjden could result from fluctuations in the composition of ground waters feeding the lake...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the life of}} <b>the</b> mines, <b>ores</b> of lower quality are blended with <b>the</b> higher quality <b>ores.</b> In general, <b>the</b> blending of <b>ores</b> at mines site {{is controlled by the}} chemical composition of <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> by controlling <b>the</b> Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 levels on the lowest side possible. However, if there is a change in mineralogy, like an increase in hydrous phase the composition may still be the same, but this dif-ference may affect the sinterability and sinter quality. The mineralogical investigation of iron ores and their chemistry are required to avoid the increase in deleterious elements during sintering. By the know-how of the behavior of individual iron ores in terms of their sinterability, in advance, the quality of <b>the</b> iron <b>ores</b> blend can be optimized to produce quality sinter and productivity. Characterisation studies conducted on iron ores of Singhbhum Orissa belt revealed that hematite, goethite, clay, gibbsite and quartz occur in all <b>the</b> iron <b>ore</b> samples but in variable proportions.

40|$|The {{beneficiation}} {{methods for}} some tantalite ores from selected deposits in Nigeria have been assessed through mineralogical and compositional analyses of <b>the</b> <b>ores.</b> Tantalite ores obtained from eight different well-known {{locations of the}} mineral in the country were analyzed with 109 Cd excitation source Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry using the emission-transmission method of quantification. The major minerals detected and quantified include TiO 2, MnO, Fe 2 O 3, Ta 2 O 5, Nb 2 O 5, WO 3, Th and U. Impurity elements such as Hf, Zn, Zr, Co, Pb, Rb, and Y were also observed and evaluated. Our analyses further show that Ta 2 O 5 in <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> ranged from a minimum concentration of about 8 % in Otu to about 60 % in the Egbe deposits, while the Nb 2 O 5 concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>ores</b> ranged from about 20 % to 37. 5 % with the highest coming from the Ofiki deposit. Based on these results {{and the work of}} other authors, we deduced that clean-up operations might be adequate for Ta extraction from most of the tantalite deposits in Nigeria.
