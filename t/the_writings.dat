5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. <b>The</b> <b>writings</b> of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, {{and those of}} the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E

Additionally, many of the images are connected to the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> of St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> of Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E
