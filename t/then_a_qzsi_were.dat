40|$|Abstract. Multi-stage {{cascaded}} quasi Z-source inverter (<b>qZSI)</b> features <b>a</b> lesser shoot-through {{duty ratio}} {{for the same}} boost factor of the input voltage, but the traditional qZSI has the disadvantage of possessing increased shoot-through ratio and very high component stress at the same voltage boost factor. The whole idea of this work is to present a multi-stage cascaded quasi Z-source inverter for application to photovoltaic power system. Three-stage cascaded <b>qZSI</b> <b>is</b> obtained by adding two diodes, two inductances and three capacitances to the traditional quasi Z-source network. Due to the cascaded structure and qZSI topology, the proposed system acquires all the advantages of impedance inverter that can realize boost/buck function in a single-stage with improved reliability, lower component rating, constant DC current from source and good power quality. Besides, the three-stage cascaded solution the shoot-through duty cycle by 25 % at the same voltage boost factor. The topological characteristics of three-stage cascaded <b>qZSI</b> system <b>is</b> analysed and operating principles are discussed. An experimental prototype is built to test the three-stage cascaded qZSI module. Simulation and experimental results are presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the proposed system...|$|R

The advantages of qZSIs include different combinations of: lower component ratings, reduced source stress, reduced component count and simplified control strategies. The conventional current-source inverter (CSI) has two major problems: unidirectional power flow and voltage boost operation, which {{make it impossible}} to be used in many applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and general-purpose variable-speed motor drives. ZSIs can solve above problems with a limitation of boosting up the output current levels. This can be overcome with the proposed Currentfed quasi-impedance source inverter.

The maximum power delivery to the load is ensured by an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on {{maximum power point tracking}} system (MPPT). The ANFIS-based MPPT offers an extremely fast dynamic response with high accuracy system. A modified space vector modulation (SVPWM) technique for the <b>qZSI</b> <b>is</b> applied to achieve low harmonics, high voltage utilization, power factor improvement and high efficiency.

40|$|Abstract- The voltage-fed Z-source {{inverter}}/quasi-Z-source inverter (<b>qZSI)</b> has <b>been</b> presented {{suitable for}} photovoltaic (PV) applications {{mainly because of}} its single-stage buck and boost capability and improved reliability. This paper further addresses detailed modeling and control issues of the qZSI used for distributed generation (DG), such as PV or fuel cell power conditioning. The dynamical characteristics of the <b>qZSI</b> network <b>are</b> first investigated by small-signal analysis. Based on the dynamic model, stand-alone operation and grid-connected operation with closed-loop control methods are carried out, which are the two necessary operation modes of DG in distributed power grids. Due to the mutual limitation between the modulation index and shoot-through duty ratio of qZSI, constant capacitor voltage control method is proposed in a two-stage control manner. Minimum switching stress on devices {{can be achieved by}} choosing a proper capacitor voltage reference.

40|$|Quasi-Z-source {{inverters}} (QZSI) acquire all {{the advantages}} of traditional Zsource inverter. The impedance network couples the source and the inverter to achieve voltage boost and inversion in a single stage. By using this new topology, the inverter draws a constant current from the PV array and is capable of handling a wide input voltage range. It also features lower component ratings, reduces switching ripples to the PV panels, causes less EMI problems and reduced source stress compared to the traditional ZSI. The quasi-Z-source inverter (<b>QZSI)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single stage power converter derived from the Z-source inverter topology, employing an impedance network which couples the source and the inverter to achieve voltage boost and inversion. A new carrier based pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy for the (<b>QZSI)</b> which gives <b>a</b> significantly high voltage gain compared to the traditional PWM techniques is implemented. This technique employs sine wave as both carrier and reference signal, with which the simple boost control for the shoot-through states is integrated to obtain an output voltage boost.

40|$|A {{single-stage}} high-voltage gain boost inverter {{is getting}} popularity in applications like solar photovoltaic, fuel cell, {{uninterruptible power system}} (UPS) systems, etc. Recently, single-stage voltage boost multilevel Z-source inverter (ZSI) and quasi-Z-source inverter (<b>QZSI)</b> have <b>been</b> proposed for dc-ac power conversion with improved power quality. Multilevel ZSI uses more number of high-power passive components in the intermediate network, which increase the system size and weight. Also, its input current is discontinuous in nature which is not desirable {{in some of the}} applications like fuel cell, UPS systems, hybrid electric vehicle, etc. In this paper, a continuous current input three-level LC-switching-based voltage boost neutral-point-clamped inverter is proposed, which uses comparatively less number of high-power passive components at the same time retains all the advantages of multilevel QZSI/ZSI. It is able to boost the input dc voltage and give required three-level ac output voltage in a single stage. Steady-state analysis of the proposed inverter is discussed to formulate the relationship between the input dc voltage and three-level ac output voltage. A unipolar pulse width modulation technique devised for the proposed inverter to eliminate first center band harmonics is also presented. The proposed converter has been verified by simulation in MATLAB Simulink as well as performing experiment {{with the help of a}} laboratory prototype...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-phase multilevel quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) topology operating in normal and fault-tolerant operation mode. This structure is composed by two symmetrical quasi-Z-source networks and a three-phase T-type inverter.

This feature is only obtained through {{changes on the}} modulation scheme after the semiconductor fault and does not require additional extra-phase legs or collective switching states. In certain fault types, {{the reduction of the}} output power capacity will be compensated by the boost characteristic of the qZSI.
