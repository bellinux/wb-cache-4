5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost.

5|$|Boniface {{accompanied}} {{the queen and}} Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward's knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258.|$|E

5|$|In May 1741, Linnaeus was {{appointed}} Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first {{with responsibility for}} medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.|$|E

5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> not the rightful owner.|$|E
5|$|At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile {{showroom}} in Canton, {{representatives of}} the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league. Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Jim Thorpe as president. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, and representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy. Ranney wrote all the information from these meetings on stationary and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> promoted to secretary of the league.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Games, Fred Yannick Uwase was the {{youngest}} male competitor representing Rwanda at the age of 18. He was the country's sole representative in Judo and had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Uwase was issued with a wildcard by the Tripartite Commission to compete in the Games after being defeated in the third round of the 2012 African Judo Championships by Mazou Abaker Mbairo. He became the first Rwandan judoka to qualify for the Olympic Games. Uwase received a bye in the first round and faced Brazilian athlete Bruno Mendonça on 30 July. He was defeated by his opponent in a 53-second match and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> unable to advance to the third round of the competition.|$|E

5|$|Bapaume {{itself was}} a small town linked by rail to Albert and Arras. There were also four major roads running through the town; running to Albert in the south-west, to Peronne in the south-east; to Cambrai {{in the east and}} to the north lay Arras. Captured by the forces of Imperial Germany {{in the early stages of}} the war, it had been the focus of the British forces on the opening day of the Battle of Somme in 1916. Still in German hands, it had been largely {{destroyed}} in early 1917 following their withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Extensive booby traps had also been left and these troubled the Australians that moved into the town afterwards. It was subsequently recaptured by the Germans during the Spring Offensive. The land surrounding Bapaume was relatively flat and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> conducive to the use of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred with horses of Central Europe and the Low Countries and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E

Only a few shots of him remain in the film, which is where the team first enters the alien hive, only his back is seen. This was because those sequences were too expensive to re-shoot.|$|E

Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by the seniors, and Marta Karolyi, the U.S. national team coordinator, has said that if Liukin had been eligible, she would have been named to the Olympic team.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong.

UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E

The building {{is close to the}} lines of all three subway divisions (the IRT, BMT, and IND) and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> a convenient location to collect fares, including tokens and cash, via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room {{in the basement of the}} building. Fare collection and transport was originally performed using armored trucks, and the money trains were replaced by armored trucks in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{with major}} delays hampering the Eurofighter, the Aeronautica Militare began {{a search for}} another interim fighter. While the Tornado itself was considered, any long term {{extension}} to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> not considered cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States. The Aeronautica Militare returned its Tornado ADVs to the RAF, with the final aircraft arriving at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004. One aircraft was retained for static display purposes.|$|E
5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles {{face-to-face}} final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and <b>thus</b> <b>was</b> unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
