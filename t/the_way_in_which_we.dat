[...] The work, along with his Femme au Chapeau from 1962 mark the beginnings of Lichtenstein's presentations of art about art because it was among his first paintings that drew upon a predecessor artist. Lichtenstein noted his objection to the attempt to reduce art diagrammatically: [...] "I wasn't trying to berate Erle Loran ... but it is such an oversimplification trying to explain a painting by A, B, C." [...] He also noted that [...] "The Cézanne is such a complex painting. Taking an outline and calling it Madame Cézanne is in itself humorous, particularly the idea of diagramming a Cézanne when Cézanne said, '... the outline escaped me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M. Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures [...] "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" [...] is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

Ryerson referred to the cause of 1837 as the cause of democracy; his decision to place the word in the title of his book, was done with the hope of suggesting that this referred [...] "to both bourgeois liberalism that will supplant the remnants of feudal oligarchy and the ultimate vision of equality in the classless society brought about by the proletarian revolution."

2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.|$|E
2500|$|Editors Bryant and Springer suggest {{perception}} {{is a central}} theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: [...] "All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks" [...] — and Ahab is determined to [...] "strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall" [...] (Ch. 36, [...] "The Quarter-Deck"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in [...] "The Doubloon" [...] (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab [...] "discover no sign" [...] (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word [...] "discover" [...] to [...] "perceive", and with good reason, for [...] "discovery" [...] means finding what is already there, but [...] "perceiving", or better still, perception, is [...] "a matter of shaping what exists by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> see it". The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it {{as a symbol of}} his making.|$|E
2500|$|Emerson did {{not become}} an ardent {{abolitionist}} until 1844, though his journals show he was concerned with slavery beginning in his youth, even dreaming about helping to free slaves. In June 1856, shortly after Charles Sumner, a United States Senator, was beaten for his staunch abolitionist views, Emerson lamented that he himself was not as committed to the cause. He wrote, [...] "There are men who {{as soon as they}} are born take a bee-line to the axe of the inquisitor[...] [...] [...] Wonderful <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are saved by this unfailing supply of the moral element". After Sumner's attack, Emerson began to speak out about slavery. [...] "I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom", he said at a meeting at Concord that summer. Emerson used slavery {{as an example of a}} human injustice, especially in his role as a minister. In early 1838, provoked by the murder of an abolitionist publisher from Alton, Illinois named Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Emerson gave his first public antislavery address. As he said, [...] "It is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live". John Quincy Adams said the mob-murder of Lovejoy [...] "sent a shock as of any earthquake throughout this continent". However, Emerson maintained that reform would be achieved through moral agreement rather than by militant action. By August 1, 1844, at a lecture in Concord, he stated more clearly his support for the abolitionist movement: [...] "We are indebted mainly to this movement, and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics".|$|E

2500|$|Whereby {{religion}} is an institutional mechanism, spirituality {{is a personal}} one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness. Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, it envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains {{that it is not}} grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment." [...] In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being [...] "church going" [...] women that {{play a vital role in}} the operation of the church. In William's article Womanist Spirituality Defined she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God. For instance, Williams declares, [...] "the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences". However, this connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman's Roundtable Discussion: [...] "Must I Be a Womanist?" [...] where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, [...] "Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field". Here Coleman explains that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's [...] "Everyday Use", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, [...] "When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout". This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: [...] "How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?" [...] Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism.|$|E
