5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>edition.</b> Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>edition</b> with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E

The text was changed in about 400 places, with most—though not all—of the typographical errors corrected. Some new erroneus readings {{were added to the}} text. In this edition the text of Jerome's Vulgate Erasmus replaced by his own more elegant translation. The Latin translation had a good reception. After this edition, Erasmus was involved in many polemics and controversies. Particularly objectionable were the annotations from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.|$|E

Forty percent of the original volume was notes.|$|E
