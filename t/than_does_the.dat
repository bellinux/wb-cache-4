5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is the {{distance}} {{from the center of the}} globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.|$|E
5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> acid.|$|E

5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Planetary geologists have {{measured}} the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in {{samples from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, {{believed to be the}} same as those of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> native field maple.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E

40|$|Pinot noir vines, {{trained to}} the Scott Henry {{trellising}} system were separated into four different quadrants: Bottom canopy, trained toward the ground; Top canopy, trained upwards; East orientation, receiving the morning sunlight; and West orientation, receiving afternoon sunlight. Yield components and fruit composition were measured for each canopy, orientation, {{and then for}} each quadrant. The bottom canopy had higher yield, cluster weight, titratable acidity, and total sugar per vine, <b>than</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> top canopy. Must soluble solids {{were not significantly different}} between the two canopies. The top canopy had a significantly higher pH. The East side of the vine, the side that receives direct morning sunlight, had a higher yield, cluster weight, and total sugar per vine <b>than</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> West side of the vine. The West side of the vine, the side that receives direct afternoon sunlight, had higher titratable acidity <b>than</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> East side of the vine.

Watir-webdriver is created entirely automatically, based on the WebDriver specification and the HTML specification.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} to resolving this problem {{relies on the}} fact that a living body is constantly losing old matter and gaining new matter. A five-year-old body consists of different matter <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.|$|E
25|$|Excluding {{contained}} {{waste and}} unintentional releases from nuclear plants, coal-plants carry more radioactive wastes {{into the environment}} than nuclear plants per unit of produced energy. Plant-emitted radiation carried by coal-derived fly ash delivers 100 times more radiation to the surrounding environment <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> normal operation of a similarly productive nuclear plant. This comparison does not consider {{the rest of the}} fuel cycle, i.e., coal and uranium mining and refining and waste disposal. The operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E
25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> average single person – {{no matter what the}} gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|E

30|$|There were {{significant}} increases in upper airway space in the TBFM and SAFM groups after maxillary protraction.

SAFM treatment may improve respiratory function in patients with maxillary hypoplasia or OSA, but this hypothesis requires further investigations.|$|R
25|$|Anatomical {{differences}} between the common chimpanzee and the bonobo are slight. Both are omnivorous adapted to a mainly frugivorous diet. Yet sexual and social behaviours are markedly different. The common chimpanzee has a troop culture based on beta males led by an alpha male, and highly complex social relationships. The bonobo, on the other hand, has egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. Bonobos frequently have sex, sometimes to help prevent and resolve conflicts. Different groups of chimpanzees also have different cultural behaviour with preferences for types of tools. The common chimpanzee tends to display greater aggression <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> bonobo. The average captive chimpanzee sleeps 9 hours and 42 minutes per day.|$|E
25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by post-tensioned internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in cable trays. These tendons are required since the eastern end support is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> shale. The intent is that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E
25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present U.S. use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide <b>than</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
