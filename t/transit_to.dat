5|$|Concerns from Rainier Valley {{residents}} over blocked intersections, property {{acquisition and}} equity led the RTA (later re-branded as Sound <b>Transit)</b> <b>to</b> study a $400 million tunnel through the Rainier Valley. In November 1999, the Sound Transit Board instead selected an at-grade alignment on Martin Luther King Jr. Way {{to the west}} of Rainier, with a station at South Edmunds Street.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $1.03 {{million in}} January 1968 to Seattle <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> develop the Blue Streak project, but the launch was delayed by a {{shortage}} in suitable buses. In May, HUD awarded a further $2.39 million to purchase 70 diesel buses, which were delivered in November.|$|E

Presto is a sister operating division of Metrolinx and the card {{can also be used}} on numerous local transit agencies in the GTHA. Discounted fares are available for passengers who use local <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> connect with a GO bus or train.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Stewart wrote {{a history}} of the New Zealand Division, which was {{published}} in 1921 and would be the main reference work for this formation for several decades. He resumed his teaching career at Canterbury College but in 1926 returned to England, as a Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds. In 1929, he became the principal of University College of Nottingham. He died suddenly in 1934 while in <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> England after a holiday in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey {{the plan}} called for {{diplomatic}} pressure on 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, to allow the Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters to <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> the Aegean Sea. A complaint to the Turkish government emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E

5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing {{in and out of}} a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2013, ‘Exercise Greyhound 2013’ {{was carried}} out by the Land Transport Authority with SBS <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> {{validate}} the procedures of SBST’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) and the workability of its contingency plans for bus bridging, free bus service and deployment of Goodwill Ambassadors (GAs) during a simulated prolonged train service disruption. About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA, SBST, SMRT, the Singapore Police Force’s Transport Command (TransCom), Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise.|$|E
5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> another part of the cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E

5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} {{to operate at}} a profit, leading Kitsap <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> consider a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service. A 0.3 percent sales tax {{was placed on the}} February 6, 2007, ballot, and was rejected by 54.5 percent of voters. As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after a few months in 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E
5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and {{the northern end of}} the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E
5|$|GO Transit {{also went}} through three major reconfigurations. In January 1997, the {{province}} {{announced it would}} transfer funding responsibility for GO <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> GTHA municipalities. The Greater Toronto Services Board, composed of regional municipality chairs, city mayors and municipal councillors, was created as a municipal agency in January 1999, and GO Transit was transferred as an arm of this agency in August 1999. However, then-Premier Mike Harris announced the province would re-assume funding responsibility for GO Transit two years later, and this was completed with {{the abolition of the}} Greater Toronto Services Board on January 1, 2002. The Greater Toronto Transportation Authority was created in 2006, with the responsibilities of co-ordinating, planning, financing and developing integrated transit in the GTHA. This agency would then become merged with GO Transit in 2009 under the name Metrolinx. GO Transit would continue as an operating division alongside two other major initiatives: the Union Pearson Express and Presto card.|$|E

5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the IRT, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit, and {{the city}} agreed to the Dual System of Rapid <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> exp{{and the city}}'s transportation. As part of the agreement, the {{existing}} IRT subway would be split into two north-south lines and a shuttle along 42nd Street. The section of the line south of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line stretching from 41st Street and Park Avenue to the Bronx, running via Lexington Avenue, while {{the section of the}} line north of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line heading south under Seventh Avenue. The section along 42nd Street was left as a shuttle to connect the new East Side and West Side Lines.|$|E
5|$|No.79 Squadron {{began moving}} to Goodenough Island {{in the war}} zone off the north coast of Papua in mid-May 1943. Its advance party {{departed}} Wooloomanata on 17May, followed by the pilots on 4June. The main body of ground crew sailed from Sydney on 7June. The squadron suffered its first fatality on 13June, when Flight Lieutenant Virgil Brennan—an experienced fighter pilot who had shot down 10 Axis aircraft over Malta—died from wounds incurred when his Spitfire collided with another while they were landing at Cairns. During the unit's <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> Goodenough Island, No.79 Squadron Spitfires were scrambled from Gurney Airfield at Milne Bay on several occasions between 19 and 25June to intercept Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, but did not damage these intruders.|$|E

5|$|The RTA, re-branded as Sound Transit, {{selected}} a preferred route {{for the light}} rail line in 1999. The northern terminus was to be located {{on the east side}} of 15th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 45th Street, and the line would travel south via a tunnel under Portage Bay towards Downtown Seattle and Rainier Valley, ending at the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Cost over-runs and withheld funding from the federal government led Sound <b>Transit</b> <b>to</b> truncate its initial light rail line to Downtown in 2001, with the segment north to the University District to be built at a later date. In 2004, Sound Transit {{selected a}} route for tunneled light rail extensions through Capitol Hill and the University District and towards Northgate, using the Montlake Cut and including a station in the vicinity of Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 45th Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} Prince George, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the squadron, was attached to the Channel Fleet during the early stages of the war. In early 1915, she was dispatched to the Mediterranean for service in the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in bombardments of Turkish forts and supported the Allied operations at Gallipoli, including the evacuation from the peninsula late in 1915. She spent the remainder of the war back in the United Kingdom, initially as an accommodation ship before being converted to a depot ship for destroyers in 1918 and stationed at Scapa Flow. For this latter role, she was renamed Victorious II before reverting to her original name in 1919. Decommissioned in 1920, she was sold for scrapping to a German company but sank off the Netherlands during <b>transit</b> <b>to</b> Germany.|$|E
