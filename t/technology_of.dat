5000|$|<b>Technologies</b> <b>of</b> {{power are}} those [...] "technologies imbued with {{aspirations}} for {{the shaping of}} conduct {{in the hope of}} producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [...] 1999:52. The two main groups <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>of</b> power are <b>technologies</b> <b>of</b> the self, and <b>technologies</b> <b>of</b> the market. Foucault defined <b>technologies</b> <b>of</b> the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality <b>of</b> life. <b>Technologies</b> <b>of</b> the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.|$|R

40|$|The task <b>of</b> {{defining}} <b>technology</b> has had {{an unhappy}} history. It seems that agreement about what technology is and even if a definition should be sought at all has not been reached. This paper argues that a definition is possible and should be sought. The etymology <b>of</b> the word <b>technology</b> suggests that it has long had a socio-technical meaning and, furthermore, Foucault's definition of four types <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> suggests a framework in which a socio-technical definition <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> can be usefully detailed. In this case the definition helps to provide a broad and deeply contextual understanding <b>of</b> what <b>technology</b> is (in its tangible and intangible forms), the processes which it influences and the processes which influence it.

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats.

Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the <b>technology</b> <b>of</b> medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German opera {{composer}} of Jewish birth who {{has been}} described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century. With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character'. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre <b>technology</b> <b>of</b> the Paris Opéra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for aerial reconnaissance appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary <b>technology</b> <b>of</b> mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E
