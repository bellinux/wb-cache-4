60|$|I hope all {{my little}} readers {{have heard the}} story of Mr. Androcles and the lion; so I will relate it as nearly as I can {{remember}} it, with the caution that Androcles must not be confounded with the lion. If I had a picture representing Androcles with a silk hat, and the lion with a knot in his tail, the two might readily be distinguished; but <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> he won't make any such picture, and we must try to get on without.|$|E

5000|$|... "Neither time nor {{evolution}} {{decreases the}} interest in the modern woman. She is both retrospective and introspective, and exists always. Mrs. Myers has told the story more graphically than anyone else… A little human comedy sartorially played!

60|$|People {{were at work}} {{chiselling}} several statues in marble {{from the}} plaster models,--a very interesting process, and which I should think a doubtful and hazardous one; but <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>say</b> {{that there is no}} risk of mischief, and that the model is sure to be accurately repeated in the marble. These persons, who do what is considered the mechanical part of the business, are often themselves sculptors, and of higher reputation than those who employ them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> of her work: “My goal is for (the work) to seem preposterous and wondrous, to {{underscore}} {{that nothing is}} more perplexing, complex, and extraordinary than nature.” ...|$|E
5000|$|With AlphaSphere, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> {{that people}} can {{disengage}} from everyday routines and plunge into aesthetic perceptions. In this process deep consciousness levels get activated and conventional experiences of space, time and [...] "me myself" [...] get transcended.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> {{about his}} work: [...] "My {{pictures}} show spaces. You {{can see them}} but you can’t get to them; {{it is as if}} they are sealed behind clear glass. The picture is a promise that cannot be honoured, it is a wistful, sad thing." ...|$|E

5000|$|About {{her focus}} on {{interior}} design, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I'm {{interested in the}} political implications of interior design; namely, why certain designers--mainly women and gay men--withdrew so markedly from the public realm of architecture or urban planning to concentrate on the domestic sphere. It is here that they engaged with objects." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} written {{to put a}} glance on the {{comparison}} between human beings and <b>the</b> ants. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> tries <b>say</b> that how we human beings are disorganized and greedy while even insects (ants) like an army of marching ants are more disciplined, in harmony and how we should learn from them.|$|R

50|$|Hristić's work {{includes}} {{solo and}} chamber works, vocal and instrumental works, ballets, radiophonic works, music for theater, film and television. His compositions {{have been performed}} by prominent national and international performers."I have never accepted {{that it is important}} to write music just for oneself and I think one is deceived by <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> who <b>says</b> he does not care about communication and influence.

50|$|In an {{interview}} to Lea Coelho Frota in 1972, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> that her first paintings in 1968 were flat, with no texture. She started playing with dimensionality, adding thick layers of paint or plaster mixed with her own hair when painting figures. Around the same time, she starts exploring {{with the use of}} text, writing dialogues out of the mouths of the figures she painted in the style of comics.|$|E
50|$|Parra Echauri is a self-taught painter, sculptor, designer, altarpiece and {{furniture}} maker and {{is credited with}} reviving interest in Mexican colonial art. He prefers commissions for religious art in colonial style, valuing their realism and drama, with lifelike veins and skin textures, poses in motion and faces with feeling. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> that “it moves his heart” to see how paint can wear off of images of Christ because worshippers tap and rub the images’ hands, feet and knees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{piece was}} {{inspired}} by a story that Borofsky's father used to tell him {{when he was a child}} about a friendly giant who lived in the sky. In each tale, father and son would travel up to the sky to talk to the giant about what needed to be done for everyone back on earth. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> the sculpture is [...] "a celebration of the human potential for discovering who we are and where we need to go." ...|$|E
5000|$|Towards 1630 he was {{appointed}} painter to Philip IV, {{and there is a}} story that on one occasion the sovereign laid his hand on <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> shoulder, <b>saying</b> [...] "Painter to the king, king of painters". After 1640 his austere, harsh, hard-edged style was unfavorably compared to the sentimental religiosity of Murillo and Zurbarán's reputation declined. Beginning by the late 1630s, Zurbarán's workshop produced many paintings for export to South America.|$|R
5000|$|Ubermorgen {{describes}} the media created by this human-machine combination as {{the creation of}} a new genre of decentralized fiction writing. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> group <b>says</b> that these books are a compressed form of our contemporary world, but they describe just a snapshot of it, frozen in time. This type of work is a form of art sometimes referred to as [...] "uncreative" [...] spurred by the famous writer Kenneth Goldsmith's efforts in uncreative writing.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, Love {{recorded}} [...] "Today I Met the Boy I'm Gonna Marry" [...] {{which was}} released {{as a single}} by Spector, and now featured Love's name as <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> She <b>says</b> that Spector offered $3,000 for her rights to the song. And though {{he said it was}} going to be a hit, she took the money. But, in spite of that decision, she said that she has continued to have a career because people have loved hearing her sing her songs.|$|R
50|$|Returning to {{the same}} beach while on {{vacation}} in late 2011 with a new digital camera, he began working at the same location but with a different intent and mood: <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> he was becoming “more comfortable with metaphysical questions,” and the subjects of his 2011 images appear at play and in harmony with nature. The title of the series, On the Beach 2.0, alludes {{to the fact that}} the photographs are grounded in their technological moment in time - as do the individual titles, which refer to the date and exact minute of each shot.|$|E
5000|$|The series 'Ruby’s Room' (1998-2007) {{features}} close-up {{images of}} the photographer’s daughter’s mouth. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says</b> {{that many of the}} best childhood moments go unrecorded, and that many of these ‘relate to pleasures and play around the mouth, moments of defiance and triumph, like managing to blow a really good bubble with bubble gum ... I wanted to magnify the colour, the spontaneity, the life, the fun and play, {{and all the things that}} I enjoyed as a mother.’ In 2010 the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa acquired 30 of the works from the series as a boxed portfolio, describing them as 'Standing alongside her Antarctic work as Anne Noble’s major body of photography from the 2000s'.|$|E
5000|$|In “Sam and the Perfect World,” {{the lush}} and idealistic {{rolling hills of}} Wisconsin are a metaphor for a modern civil society that values perfection. Humankind has {{transformed}} the landscape for their own use, altering this Garden of Eden, and erected a barbed wire fence; poignantly separating Sam {{for the rest of}} the world. A halo around the sun is said to represent a deity looking down upon the handwork of humankind. Without idealization or sentimentality Lenz portrays his son with an enigmatic and endearing expression, his red shirt and Oshkosh overalls giving us clues that he is like any other boy, and yet he is not. “Nevertheless,” <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says,</b> Sam has “something very important to say.” ...|$|E
60|$|Whoever {{located the}} ecclesiastical {{buildings}} of England and Scotland certainly had an exquisite perception of natural scenery; for one notices {{that they are}} almost invariably placed on just that point of the landscape, where the poet or <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> would <b>say</b> they should be. These cathedrals, though all having a general similarity of design, seem, each one, {{to have its own}} personality, as much as a human being. Looking at nineteen of them is no compensation to you for omitting the twentieth; there will certainly be something new and peculiar in that.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> rising <b>artist</b> coloured, <b>saying,</b> [...] "Please, my lady, don't name it to no one. I {{would not}} have shown it, but little Bess, she pulled down all my things on the floor when I was not looking. It is from memory, my lady, as she looks when she's doing {{anything}} for Sir Harry." ...|$|R
2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} on July 22, 2014, the two American flags {{attached}} to poles atop each tower were found to have been replaced by American flags that had been bleached white. [...] It is believed that several individuals covered the lights that illuminate the flags, then climbed the cables {{to the top of the}} two bridge towers. [...] Authorities reviewed evidence including surveillance footage and DNA taken from the bridge, and by August 1, 2014, they found up to nine [...] "persons of interest" [...] with a possible motive being cannabis activism. [...] However, on August 12, 2014, two Berlin artists claimed responsibility for hoisting the two white flags, causing the security panic and investigation by New York police. Mischa Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke said the flags were meant to celebrate [...] "the beauty of public space" [...] and the anniversary of the death of German-born John Roebling, who designed the famous bridge. <b>The</b> <b>artists</b> <b>say</b> they hand-sewed <b>the</b> two flags into all-white replicas of an American flag and had the original flags ready to return. [...] "This was not an anti-American statement," [...] Wermke said.|$|R
5000|$|Blackburn {{incorporates}} {{found objects}} and materials on his canvases, citing their [...] "previous existence". His paintings utilize acrylic paint, oil paint, and encaustic, {{as well as}} resin, grit, house-paint, and varnish; according to a review of his 2015 show at the ARTIS Gallery, recent work [...] "rides roughshod over any conventions of neatness and grace, using bold form, often black, and adorning his surface with found objects and collage." [...] Of his own work, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I suppose, that’s what my painting’s about; life itself is terribly dangerous, terribly cruel, terribly rewarding. All these things at once. This multi-faceted, wonderful jewel - which we all live with and die with - is there. We’re saddled with it, like it or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gogi Saroj Pal’s Being a Woman series {{focus on}} her concern of the place women have in society. In this evocative painting, the women has been {{rendered}} in a likeness of Christ’s crucifixion, but without a cross. The outstretched hands, the slight slumping {{of the head and}} the way in which the legs seems pinned together are reminiscent of Christ’s torment. ‘There is so much celebration of pain, we are reminded of how much he suffered on our account.’ <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says,</b> ‘but what of the anguish of women.’ Gogi Saroj pal finds it ironic that people shed tears on Christ’s suffering, but are unmoved by our overlook of sorrows of the women in their own surroundings- weather mother, sister, wife, partner, friend or daughter. This painted sisterhood of grief gives this work a powerful poignancy.|$|E
5000|$|... "The film {{tells the}} story of the life and times of Fakir Lallan Shah. So through the make-up, I had to show the fine changes in his facial {{features}} as he grew from a 24-year-old man to a 70-year-old," [...] says Gaikwad who has been in the industry for two decades. He made use of prosthetic make-up for Moner Manush. [...] "Throughout the film, I chose not to use wigs for the character's hair. Instead, I stuck actual hair which gave the appearance of a wanderer to Lallan," [...] he adds. Thrilled at his win, an acknowledgement of his hard work, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "A National Award is an important benchmark for any artist connected to the film-making business. These awards honour talent. I was hoping to win but with the good work done by so many artistes across the country, I wasn't very sure that the honour would be mine." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> Jan Wanggaard <b>says</b> {{about the}} project that he intend nothing with the {{installation}} other than letting it stay there and maybe inspire people who bump into it in {{one or the other}} way - as an artistic expression or a nice tool to help understand the size and proportions of the Solar System that we all live in.|$|R
5000|$|Coolstreak Comics' Leroy Douresseaux {{comments}} on the author's [...] "evocative art, in which she emphasizes emotion in body language, facial expressions". Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood also {{comments on}} <b>the</b> manga <b>artist's</b> art <b>saying,</b> [...] "the more serious overtones of this story give <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> {{a chance to show}} the more stark and dramatic side to her illustrations and imagination".
