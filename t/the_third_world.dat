5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically.

5|$|In February 1972, Nixon {{announced}} a stunning rapprochement with Mao's China by traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's influence in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> and cooled relations with Western Europe.

5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> Congress in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more.

The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.|$|E

Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery.

5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example {{for the rest of the}} populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> debt problem, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, churches {{teaching}} prosperity theology saw significant {{growth in}} <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World.</b> According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University, poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing {{because of their}} economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on miracles. One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa, particularly Nigeria. In the Philippines, the El Shaddai movement, part of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity. One South Korean prosperity church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world's largest congregation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{emerging}} {{nations of}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected {{the pressure to}} choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved {{to stay out of}} the Cold War. The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>World</b> transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.|$|E
