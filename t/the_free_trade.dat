5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions. This panel demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions.|$|E
5|$|Edward Pulsford {{was born}} at Burslem in Staffordshire on 29 September 1844. His mother was Mary Ann, née Cutler, and his father, James Eustace Pulsford, was a Baptist {{minister}} and businessman. He received a private education and worked with his father as a commission agent; together they worked in Hull, Yorkshire, from 1870 to 1884. On 23 February 1870, he married Mary Charlotte Stainforth at Hull; she would predecease him. In 1883 Edward embarked for New South Wales, while his father travelled to New York to become resident secretary of the Liverpool, London & Globe Insurance Company. After his arrival in Sydney, Pulsford immediately became involved in <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> cause, and in 1885 he co-founded <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> and Liberal Association of New South Wales (FTLA, a forerunner of <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Party) with Bernhard Wise.

5|$|Pulsford {{established}} a successful business {{with his father}} as commission agents in Yorkshire before moving his interests to New South Wales in 1883. There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Party.

5|$|As a backbencher, McCay opposed {{amendments}} to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved {{an amendment to the}} Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson's Labor government. <b>The</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Party's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence.|$|E
5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting.

When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews.

5|$|To {{generate}} {{support for}} the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, {{who had worked for}} the Hull and Barnsley Railway. His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees.

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. <b>The</b> <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
