5|$|CenturyLink Field {{has hosted}} several college {{football}} games. The hometown Washington Huskies played their 2005 season opener against the Air Force Falcons {{at the stadium}} in Tyrone Willingham's first game as head coach. In 2011, the University of Washington began a $250 million renovation to Husky Stadium, so <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> and the Washington State Cougars played the 2011 Apple Cup at CenturyLink Field. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> also played their entire 2012 home football schedule at CenturyLink Field.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> entered 2008 {{seeking to}} prove their success the {{previous}} season was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, West Virginia, 66–21. A loss to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> a final 2007 record of 9–4. In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.|$|E

5|$|The Trojans next {{visited the}} Washington Huskies, led by first–year head coach Tyrone Willingham and quarterback Isaiah Stanback. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> took an early lead {{on a field}} goal, but the Trojans {{answered}} with a Leinart touchdown pass to Steve Smith. Stanback threw his only touchdown of the game late in the quarter to give <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> a 10–7 lead, but the Trojans took the lead for good {{less than a minute}} later with Leinart's second touchdown pass of the day. A minute into the second quarter Reggie Bush ran for a touchdown, and, after a failed extra point attempt and <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> offense unable to move the ball, two minutes later returned a punt 84yards for a touchdown. After another failed drive for <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> and another twominutes, Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to give the Trojans a 34–10 lead. Stanback rushed for a touchdown with twominutes remaining before half-time to cut their deficit in half, but Mario Danelo kicked a field goal as time expired to give the Trojans a 37–17 lead at half-time. In the third quarter, Leinart threw his fourth touchdown of the game before he was replaced by backup Booty. A Booty interception, that was returned 76yards by Dashon Goldson, gave <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> their last score of the game, and Booty's touchdown pass to Patrick Turner proved to be the final score in the game, giving the Trojans a 51–24 win. With the win the Trojans extended their winning streak to 29games.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Tyler {{started at}} fullback {{for the first}} time in a game against Oregon State, winless at the time, and rushed for 151 yards, including a 55-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, to lead <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> to a 20–14 victory. In the team's next game, the back scored twice as Washington beat twelfth-ranked Arizona State. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> finished with seven wins and four losses, missing a bowl game. Tyler averaged 5.5 yards a carry in the 1978 season.|$|E
5|$|Even if <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{were still}} a strong {{national}} contender, {{they were no longer}} viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3–1 record against <b>the</b> <b>Huskies,</b> a record that would be repeated the following year.|$|E
50|$|Sometime before 1932, <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> {{name was}} again sold, {{this time to}} the New Britain Machine Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which was {{purchased}} by Litton Industries in the 1970s. When Litton dissolved its hand tools division in the 1980s, it sold <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> brand (and other assets, including the Blackhawk brand) to National Hand Tool. The Stanley Works acquired <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> brand with its 1986 acquisition of National Hand Tool. In 1992, Stanley began supplying <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> brand exclusively to The Home Depot, and sometime later transferred {{the rights to the}} name to Home Depot.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{started the}} season strong, winning their first five games. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) {{opponent}} Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as {{the remnants of}} Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was next on the schedule; <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was not decided until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No.23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville game; <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{would be forced to}} rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{iteration}} of the [...] "Audax" [...] Hillman <b>Husky,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Series III", {{made its}} debut in 1963, along with a face-lift for the whole Minx range (and its badge-engineered derivatives). The face-lift bodywork changes were applied to <b>the</b> <b>Husky,</b> but <b>the</b> reduction in wheel size from 15 in to 13 in, which {{was applied to the}} saloons, was not applied to <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> in order to maintain its ground clearance. In addition, whilst the contemporary Series V Minx got front disc brakes, <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> continued with four-wheel drum brakes. While the 1390 cc engine continued to be used in most markets, for <b>the</b> USA <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> adopted <b>the</b> 1592 cc engine used in the contemporary Minx Series V.|$|R
50|$|In January 1929, <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> {{name was}} sold to the Olsen Manufacturing Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin. The company {{relocated}} to Kenosha and {{changed its name to}} <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> Corporation. Mandl went on to work for Blackhawk Manufacturing of Milwaukee.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Husky</b> {{features}} a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering {{over all but}} {{the rear of the}} fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making <b>the</b> <b>Husky</b> ideal for observation and patrol roles. [...] Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for <b>the</b> <b>Husky's</b> weight) [...] Textron Lycoming O-360 flat-four piston engine turning a constant speed propeller. In 2015 a reversible MT Propeller was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane water operations. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Husky's</b> high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance.|$|R
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> to retain possession. A holding penalty on the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteenyards {{but was unable to}} reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo statistically in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held scoreless {{in the second half}} when <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> stopped turning the ball over.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, UConn boasted one of {{the better}} {{defenses}} in the country. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281yards allowed. Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E

50|$|The impostor Santa {{shows up}} in the house, much to the amazement of Pooch and the girl coonhound. The two dogs are further delighted when they are invited by him to go on a sleigh ride. Momentarily, the cat and a pack of rats, in a chase, jump into the fake Santa's beard. A scuffle in it occurs until the beard falls off, and <b>the</b> <b>husky</b> is exposed. Pooch and the girl coonhound attempt to run but <b>the</b> <b>husky</b> manages to catch their legs. Hopefully, the toy {{soldiers}} and other toys in the house come to life, and go on to help the two dogs by disrupting <b>the</b> <b>husky.</b> This goes on until Pooch places a noose around <b>the</b> <b>husky's</b> legs and has him hanging on the ceiling. The real Santa finally breaks from the ropes, and enters the house. To get back at the perpetrator, Santa delivers a strong straight punch which sends <b>the</b> <b>husky</b> airborne many yards away.|$|R

5|$|Northern Illinois got {{the ball}} to start the game and, after three plays totaling three yards, were forced to punt, going three-and-out. Kent State's first drive also {{resulted}} in a three-and-out. <b>The</b> <b>Huskies</b> took over at their own 14 on the ensuing drive and managed to achieve one first down prior to having to punt. The first scoring drive occurred for the Golden Flashes on their second drive, but they were aided by Huskies' punt returner Angelo Sebastiano fumbling a Kent State punt. They {{took advantage of the}} mistake and ultimately scored on a 15-yard touchdown run by Dri Archer. After <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> failed to score on their next drive, Kent State capitalized again on a 37-yard field goal by Freddy Cortez. The final drive of the first quarter lasted 14 plays for 65 yards and ended in a Mathew Sims 27-yard field goal.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2005, Roy led <b>the</b> <b>Huskies</b> {{to victory}} over the Arizona State Sun Devils with a college career-high 35 points and became the 31st Washington player to score 1,000 points in a career.
