The more difficult species to grow include <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> were cancelled.|$|E

Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a {{game show}} {{is a type of}} radio, television, or {{internet}} program in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering trivia questions and/or solving puzzles, usually for money and/or prizes. Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows, in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes; in {{a game show}}, prizes can typically be won in a single match (in some cases, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> offer record-setting prizes, contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total).|$|E

5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> were produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples.

5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} about including character goods with the volume releases, Sugawara {{came up with}} the atypical idea of releasing a deluxe and normal edition of the manga after contemplating the inconsistency of novels getting both a soft-cover and hard-cover release, but manga only received one version. Because it was a new concept, the group experienced several mishaps such as accidentally placing a vertically flipped illustration on the first deluxe edition. The group also decided to use another atypical practice of keeping catchphrases that appeared in the magazine identical to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> appear on the frontispieces of the deluxe editions.|$|E
5|$|Within the congregation, {{there are}} many {{organizations}} that specialize in various activities, all of which strive to better the church or community or both.

This way, the congregation can remain a close knit family, not just a church where parishioners spend an hour praying on Sunday mornings.

5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the energy saving {{that can be}} achieved with the energy-aware cooperative management of the cellular access networks of two operators offering service over the same area. We evaluate the amount of energy that can be saved by using both networks in high traffic conditions, but switching off <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> two during the periods when traffic is so low that the desired quality of service can be obtained with just one network. When <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> two networks is off, its customers are allowed to roam over <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is on. Several alternatives are studied, as regards the switch-off pattern: <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> balances <b>the</b> switch-off frequencies, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> balances roaming costs, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> balances energy savings, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> maximizes <b>the</b> amount of saved energy.

5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> Shumachov had sold. Adams {{brought it to the}} Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E
