5|$|Finely divided {{metallic}} osmium is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen at room temperature, forming volatile osmium tetroxide.

5|$|Little Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Conyngham Township, along with the Susquehanna River. The creek is also <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> flooding in Dorrance Township and one of the main sources in Rice Township. A 100 year flood of the creek would flood substantial areas. Such flooding would also be exacerbated by backwater flooding from the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|Mathematical models {{show that}} the E ring is unstable, with a {{lifespan}} between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s some suspected that Enceladus is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> particles for the ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus {{is not enough}} to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E

However, the creek's floods cause little damage in Courtdale, since its floodplain is relatively undeveloped in that borough. The creek has an Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan.|$|E

5|$|Today, some cobalt is {{produced}} specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), but <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the element is as {{a by-product of}} copper and nickel mining.

5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 {{percent of the}} mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can {{occur when the}} creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
