5|$|The hosts Arsenal played Paris Saint-Germain in {{the later}} game. Although the {{visitors}} dominated play in the first 45 minutes, they went behind at <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> half-time, when Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini scored. He collected the ball from Nicklas Bendtner and his first-time shot went in off the post. Wenger tweaked his team's formation after the break from their customary 4–4–2 to 4–4–1–1 and made five changes to his team. He positioned right-back Emmanuel Eboué as a midfielder, and Alexander Hleb behind Bendtner. Arsenal's performance improved {{in the second half}} and they doubled their lead through Bendtner in the 70th minute. Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia immediately denied Pauleta with a stretching save at the far post, but could not prevent Péguy Luyindula from scoring. Arsenal held on to win by two goals.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was on <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire {{to stimulate the economy}} than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E

5|$|Three {{straight}} draws {{followed in}} December, the first away to league leaders Aston Villa. United were fortunate {{to pick up}} a point given their opponents dominance in the second half, and were careless at Tottenham Hotspur, throwing away a 2–0 lead. Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, tugging on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane. Chelsea grabbed a creditable draw at Old Trafford to stake their championship credentials four days later and United, who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3–2; their last defeat of the season. On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four.|$|E
5|$|When the {{war began}} the Army was on <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> a generational change. At the time, the senior {{officers}} on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey, although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two. Then came the Chief of the General Staff, Major General John Lavarack; the Adjutant General, Major General Sir Carl Jess; Major General Owen Phillips, the Quartermaster General; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman, {{the commander of the}} 3rd Division; and Major General Iven Mackay, the commander 2nd Division. All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett, Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers. Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF, for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies. Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939. Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) I Corps following its raising in March 1940, while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} systems of house division. In most, the {{ecliptic}} {{is divided into}} houses and the ascendant (eastern horizon) marks the cusp, or beginning, of the first house, and the descendant (western horizon) marks <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> the seventh house. Many systems, called quadrant house systems, also use the midheaven (medium coeli) as <b>the</b> <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> the tenth house.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} teeth protect the posterior teeth by providing for a plane of guidance during excursions, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior teeth to disclude rather than strike one another during lateral or protrusive movements from centric relation. In other words, the posterior teeth have much larger crowns {{and many more}} <b>cusps</b> than <b>the</b> {{anterior teeth}}. Because posterior crowns are so much wider and possess cuspal projections in various configurations, <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary teeth {{and those of the}} mandibular teeth have an opportunity to bang into each other during chewing, speech or simply meeting together when one bites down. To prevent this from happening, the anterior teeth of each arch will, ideally, be situated so as to come into contact before <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior teeth do, thus preventing wear on the posterior teeth. This requires less force because the anterior teeth are further from the joint (analogous to stopping a door further from its hinge).|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the upper}} central incisors are {{wider than the}} lower ones, the other teeth in the upper arch are arrayed {{somewhat}} distally, and the two sets do not quite correspond to each other when the mouth is closed: thus the upper canine tooth rests partly on the lower canine and partly on the lower first premolar, and <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper molar teeth lie behind <b>the</b> corresponding <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower molar teeth.|$|R

40|$|Background. Valvular {{apparatus}} {{of the heart}} is the frequent object of the surgical operations for today. Morphological changes which are happed within valves of the heart at time of cardiac diseases the modern medicine considers on the clinical, instrumental, histological, cytological and ultramicroscopical levels. The cardiac surgeons that make the heart valve replacement using the tissue engineering have the great interest {{in front of the}} heart valves. The achievements of the modern medicine are impossible without the fundamental morphological investigations. Objective. To study the morphological features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> human heart valves on the light and ultramicroscopic levels. Methods. We have reviewed <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> 48 heart valves of adults. It was used a light and electron microscopy which enabled us to study <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular and ventriculo-vascular heart valves. Results. The data indicate that <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> heart valves are stratified. Layers <b>of</b> <b>cusps</b> are made <b>of</b> different types of fibrous connective tissues. The spongy layer is made of loose connective tissue, the fibrous layer – dense regular connective tissue, ventricular layer – dense irregular connective tissue. The arrangement of these layers in <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular heart valves (in the direction from atrium toward ventricle) is: spongy, fibrous and ventricular. The arrangement of these layers in <b>the</b> <b>cusps</b> <b>of</b> ventricular-vascular heart valves (in the direction from side that is faced to the wall of blood vessel toward the ventricle) is: fibrous, spongy, ventricular. Conclusion. The position of data layers within <b>cusp</b> <b>of</b> atria-ventricular valves differs from position of data layers within ventriculo-vascular valves. These changes of tissue localization correlate to haemodynamic conditions during heart cycle. Citation: Fedoniuk L, Semeniuk T, Bodnar E.
