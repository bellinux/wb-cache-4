When the PSI subunits PsaF and PsaJ are missing the ring is composed of 17 IsiA subunits, indicating that each IsiA subunit has a different interaction with the trimer. This suggests that the size of the PSI complex determines the number of IsiA units in the surrounding ring. In the absence of PsaL, it has a tendency to form incomplete rings with PSI monomers, suggesting PsaL helps form the rings. Also it can form other aggregates of varying sizes depending on the level of iron-deprivation.|$|E
