5000|$|It is {{a patent}} {{infringement}} to [...] someone else <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> a <b>patent.</b> A patent {{can be a}} composition of unpatented components; the patent would cover the inventive step of selecting and assembling those components.

50|$|MathWorks {{was found}} <b>to</b> have <b>infringed</b> 3 <b>patents</b> from National Instruments in 2003, which was {{confirmed}} by a court of appeal in 2004. The result was an injunction forbidding the manufacture and sale of Simulink R14. MathWorks then released R14SP1 to circumvent the injunction, but this was still alleged <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> <b>patents</b> by National Instruments. There isn't much information that is publicly available after that {{on the outcome of}} the following trial for these new infringements, but since Simulink has remained on sale ever since and is still available in 2017, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that subsequent releases after R14SP1 were found <b>to</b> no longer <b>infringe</b> on National Instruments' patents, or that the court ruling went in favour of MathWorks, or again that National Instruments' patents eventually expired.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, if {{the federal}} {{government}} or one of its contractors <b>infringes</b> a <b>patent,</b> the only remedy available to patent holders is a lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims. It is the policy of the U.S. Department of Defense to allow contractors <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> <b>patents</b> and <b>to</b> defend the contractor against patent infringement claims at Government expense. Use of this provision by agencies other than Department of Defense is rare. During the 2001 anthrax attacks through the US Postal Service, the US Government threatened to issue a compulsory license for the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin, if the patent owner, Bayer, didn't lower the price to the government. Bayer lowered the price and the government backed down on the threat.|$|R

50|$|The {{patentee}} may {{exercise a}} right to demand an injunction against the person who infringes or is likely <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> its rights: Article 100(1) of the Patent Act. A “person who infringes or is likely <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> the <b>patent</b> rights” in that paragraph means a person who works (Article 2(3)) a patented invention without the patentee's permission, or a person who commits an act of indirect infringement.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{jury found}} that Nellcor <b>infringed</b> several Masimo <b>patents</b> related to measure-through motion and low {{perfusion}} signal processing technology.

40|$|Corporations and {{businesses}} make important decisions everyday {{that affect their}} financial viability and market image. This article analyzes the phenomenon of patent infringement, considering whether firms consciously decide <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> certain <b>patents</b> as a sound business strategy, or whether such cases arise spontaneously due to incomplete and careless research of prior art by infringing firms. The author considers {{the extent to which}} patent infringement may remain an effective business strategy for technology-producing firms, even when not employed willfully, due to the inadequate deterrence function of current U.

[...] BT sued Prodigy, the oldest ISP in the U.S., for patent infringement on December 13, 2000. [...] In suing, BT claimed that the Sargent patent covered hyperlink technology, one of {{the building blocks of}} the World Wide Web. BT argued that not only had Prodigy directly <b>infringed</b> the Sargent <b>patent,</b> but that it was also liable for inducing its users <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> BT's <b>patent.</b> Prodigy submitted a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, arguing that the technology it used to provide Internet access to its consumers was not covered by the claims of the Sargent patent.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{the game}} for patent holders is to reveal as little as possible, while {{claiming}} as much as possible. The less that is disclosed, the more that can be retained {{and serve as a}} competitive edge. The wider the claims, the tougher it is for competitors not <b>to</b> <b>infringe,</b> however, the <b>patent</b> holder must avoid the known and the obvious or risk patent invalidity.|$|R
5000|$|SEB {{accepted}} {{a settlement with}} Sunbeam and proceeded to sue Pentalpha under two theories. First, SEB claimed that Pentalpha had directly <b>infringed</b> upon its <b>patent</b> in violation of 35 U.S.C. §271(a). Second, SEB claimed that Pentalpha had induced Sunbeam, Fingerhut, and Montgomery Ward <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> upon the <b>patent,</b> contravening §271(b). The jury found for SEB on both claims and additionally that Pentalpha had willfully <b>infringed</b> upon SEB's <b>patent,</b> awarding SEB $4.65 million. Pentalpha filed post-trial motions {{on a number of}} grounds with the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The District Court granted them in part, reducing the jury award to $2.65 million.|$|R

5000|$|AT&T held {{a patent}} (US Patent No. 4472832) {{on a program}} that could {{digitally}} encode and compress recorded speech on a computer. Microsoft's Windows operating system had the potential <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> that <b>patent</b> because Windows incorporated a software called NetMeeting that, when installed, enabled a computer to process speech {{in the same manner}} as claimed by AT&T's patent. Microsoft shipped abroad a [...] "master version" [...] of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission, to foreign manufacturers. These manufacturers first used the master version of Windows to generate copies, and then installed the copies onto the computers they sold to users abroad. AT&T accused Microsoft of <b>infringing</b> U.S. <b>Patent</b> Re. 32580, which was a reissue of U.S. Patent No. 4472832, and filed a suit charging Microsoft with liability for the foreign replications and installations of Windows.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{cases of}} divided patent infringement: {{those in which}} two or more parties collectively perform all the steps of a patented claim, but where no single party acting alone has completed the entire patented invention. Despite the increasing frequency with which such cases appear to be arising, courts have struggled to equitably resolve these lawsuits under {{the constraints of the}} existing statutory framework because of the competing policy concerns they present. On the one hand, any standard that holds two or more parties strictly liable whenever their combined actions <b>infringe</b> a <b>patent</b> risks imposing liability on countless seemingly innocent actors who are unaware that their activities are being combined with those of another party <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> a <b>patent.</b> On the other hand, any attempts to establish more restrictive conditions for the imposition of divided infringement liability have inevitably created loopholes through which parties can easily structure their activities to avoid incurring infringement liability. While scholars have previously recognized the difficulties presented by divided infringement lawsuits, this Article offers a novel explanation for why these cases have proven to be particularly challenging for courts to resolve. Specifically, although courts were historically well equipped to handle cases of divided infringement at common law through the imposition of contributory tort liability, Congress’s shortsighted codification of the law of patent infringement in the Patent Act of 1952 —and its narrow formulation of the doctrine of contributory patent infringement in particular—currently prevents the judiciary from relying on this common law doctrine to its full historic extent. This Article asserts that Congress should correct this mistake by enacting a new statutory provision to govern cases of divided patent infringement. By allowing courts to impose liability on any party who knowingly collaborates with another <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> a <b>patent,</b> Congress can prevent would-be infringers from intentionally circumventing patent protection, {{while at the same time}} ensuring that innocent actors who may unwittingly contribute to an infringement are not unfairly exposed to liability...|$|R

40|$|Digitization {{has reached}} things. This shift {{promises}} {{to alter the}} business and legal landscape {{for a range of}} industries. Digitization has already disrupted copyright-based industries and laws. As cost barriers dropped, individuals engaged with copyrighted work as never before. The business-to-business models of industrial copyright faltered and in some cases failed. Industries had to reorganize, and claimed foundations for copyright had to be re-examined. This Article examines a prime example the next phase of digitization: 3 D printing and it implications on intellectual property law and practice. 3 D printing is a general-purpose technology that will do for physical objects what MP 3 files did for music. The core patent bargain — sharing the plans on how to make something in exchange for exclusivity — may be meaningless in a world of digitized things. While these devices will unleash the creativity of producers and reduce costs for consumers, they will also make it far easier <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> <b>patents,</b> copyrights, and trade dress. This will force firms to rethink their business practices and courts to reexamine not only patent doctrine but also long established doctrine in areas ranging from copyright merger to trademark post-sale confusion. Moreover, Congress will need to consider establishing some sort of infringement exemption for 3 D printing in the home and expanding the notice-and takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to websites that host software enabling the 3 D printing of patented items and distinctive trade dress. While a 3 D printer is not yet a common household item, the time to start thinking about that future is now...|$|R
