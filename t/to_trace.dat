5|$|Montana sapphires {{in general}} {{come in a}} variety of colors, but Yogos are almost always blue. About two percent of Yogos are purple, due <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> amounts of chromium. A very small number of rubies have been found at Yogo Gulch.|$|E

5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise {{that many of those}} accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of a}} hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation.

As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used <b>to</b> <b>trace</b> the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E
