From a randomly assembled group of 42 children aged between 5 and 8 years, residing in a community with non-fluoridated water, spot urinary samples were taken before the <b>topical</b> application of <b>dental</b> fluoride varnish and 2 hours afterwards. In an age-matched control group of 16 children from the same community, who received no treatment, samples were taken the same way. The urinary excretion of fluoride was analysed by determining fluoride ion (F-) level and fluoride/creatinine (F/Cr) ratio in the urine. In the study group, the average pre- and post-treatment F/Cr ratios were 0. 42 and 1. 38 mg/g, respectively (p <. 001).

40|$|The {{number of}} {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease especially with diabetic nephropathy {{is expected to grow}} significantly in the fature. It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and the consequence of this emerging public health problem is considerable consumption of medical and financial resources. Thereby, there is a higher chance to see such patients in a dental office. People with kidney disease and those on dialysis {{are more likely to have}} periodontal disease and other oral health problems than the general population. Build up of bacteria in the mouth can cause infection. Because people with kidney disease have weakened immune systems, they are more susceptible to infections. Moreover, bone loss in the jaw can occur in those with kidney disease. Calcium imbalance contributes to loss of calcium from the bones resulting in weak bones. Weak bones can cause teeth to become loose and potentially fall out. The doctor may recommend antibiotics be taken prior to the dental procedure to help guard against infection.

40|$|Summary The {{diocese of}} Halberstadt existed between 804 - 1648 {{and has had}} a {{considerable}} political weight in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. During the centuries Halberstadt developed and became an approved political, economic and cultural centre in the country north of the Harz Mountains. At {{the end of the}} 1830 ies the increasing industrialization led to a rapid increase of the population under formation of a rich bourgeoisie. This fact {{and the members of the}} armed forces living in Halberstadt made the town for dentists attractive. At the beginning of the 19 th century the first "resident" dentists came to Halberstadt. They belonged to different professional guilds (surgeons IInd class, physicians, representatives of paramedical, craft oriented branches of profession). After 1825, when in Prussia the regulations for the state examination of the medical staff were announced, the candidates of the dentistry had to solve a state examination and to prove the visit of medical lectures. After this they could receive the newly introduced license to practise medicine (Approbation). But at this time there were no independent training centres for that professional group. The dental-medical education still took place mainly in four medical-surgical educational establishments (T. F. Mehlhardt is the only known graduate of the medical-surgical educational establishment of Magdeburg who sat down as a dentist in Halberstadt during the investigation period). Because the few local dentists could not cover the increasing need of treatment of the population, Halberstadt was visited by travelling dentists, too. They made announcements in the newspaper "Halberstädter Intelligenzblatt" beforehand. Besides, this local newspaper even contained advertisements about the sales of self-made <b>dental</b> <b>drugs</b> (for example the Vogler´sche dental tincture). Short biographies report about the dentists F. A. H. Hartig, F. Kästner and the Magdeburg dentist's family Lebrecht. In contrast to the possibilities of treatments of the urban population less and lower educated medical staff (surgeons IInd class) were available for the rural population. With the example of the Dedeleben family Kels/Kölß/Paschedag is shown the development from a "badly" barber-surgeon to a surgeon IInd class. Special attention was given to the evaluation of the social status, medical literature as well as the wax model of the surgeon Paschedag. Not only had the era of those local barber-surgeons / surgeon's families come to an end with his death. The end of his practice fell at the same decade in which the dualism between physicians and surgeons was abolished by law. According to the Gewerbeordnung (1869) skilful representatives of other professional guilds were also legitimized to exercise the dentistry. In the heritage of the Dedeleben hairdresser C. H. F. Wolf was found a wooden case with bleed-instruments and a leather pocket with 17 different surgical instruments for dental extractions. The pocket was filled with the instruments of Paschedag, maybe because their proved familiar relationship...|$|R

5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show <b>topical</b> {{fluoride}} reduces <b>dental</b> caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|R
