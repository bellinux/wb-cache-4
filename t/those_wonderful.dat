25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E
500|$|The College Dropout {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times dubbed it [...] "2004's first great hip-hop album". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised its [...] "substance, social commentary, righteous anger, ornery humanism, dark humor, and even Christianity", calling it [...] "one of <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> crossover albums {{that appeal to}} a huge audience without sacrificing a shred of integrity". Dave Heaton of PopMatters called the album [...] "musically engaging", writing that [...] "every single one of these songs comes off like a genuine extension of Kanye's personality and experiences". URB wrote that the album [...] "manages to be both visceral and emotive, sprinkling the dancefloors with tears and sweat." [...] Mojo dubbed the album [...] "manna for hip hop fans starved of basic but ballistic beats-and-breaks fare in an increasingly litigious age." ...|$|E

I {{used to hear}} <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, {{bringing}} the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray.

Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate to me right now, in the way that you know that all <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E

He explained his motivation: Well all my life, scientific life, people have given me lots of resources and lots of opportunities and I think it's a matter of duty; when the finger is pointed to you it's your duty to pay back some of <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> things that have been given.

It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anglo-American {{economist}} Ronald Coase {{has challenged}} {{the view that}} Smith was a deist, {{based on the fact}} that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the [...] "Great Architect of the Universe", later scholars such as Jacob Viner have [...] "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God", a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the Wealth of Nations in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the [...] "great phenomena of nature", such as [...] "the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to [...] "enquire into their causes", and that [...] "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{reference}} to the real-world revival and massive success of King Kong in the 1950s in the 1959 movie A Summer Place. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents {{that they are going to}} a classic movie showing of King Kong, when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls King Kong [...] "one of <b>those</b> <b>wonderful</b> old horror numbers." [...] Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, [...] "It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.". In 1974's Herbie Rides Again Alonzo Hawk has been having nightmares about Herbie. During his nightmare sequence there is a King Kong-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like planes flying around him and squirting oil until he falls off the Empire State Building. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape.
