5|$|The {{speech was}} a success and Ingersoll’s {{appellation}} of “plumed knight” remained a nickname for Blaine for years <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285 and no other candidate had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts {{in the next five}} ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor at just 111. On the seventh ballot the situation shifted drastically as anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes; by the time the balloting ended, Blaine’s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him at 384, a majority.|$|E

On April 30, 2008, Clinton agreed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show {{as part of a}} pre-taped interview that would be broadcast over two days. The host also held an exclusive, four-part interview with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Both interviews drew significant media attention as they were front runners for the 2008 presidential election. In the same election cycle, Ron Paul and O'Reilly got into a testy exchange over the issue of Iran. The 2008 Republican candidate for Vice President, Sarah Palin, and then Democratic Vice President candidate Joe Biden were also invited to the show, but chose not to make an appearance.|$|E

25|$|The {{home country}} {{organization}} will contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.|$|E

[...] Despite the difficulties of its production, Some Like It Hot became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat".

The episode guest stars actor Paul Rudd as former rock star Desmond Fellows. During casting {{of the character of}} Vinnie Van Lowe, Rudd was considered to play the part; however, the role was given instead to Ken Marino, who appears in the episode. Marino and Rudd are friends in real life. Rudd was a friend of Enbom and Etheridge, and he had been signed on to appear in the episode by the airing of [...] "Spit & Eggs". They had lobbied Rudd <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show for several years. Thomas described the reason for Rudd not appearing earlier being that the crew were unable to find a good moment for the character's entry that worked with Rudd's schedule.|$|E
500|$|In September 2013, Thompson {{expressed}} his hatred of Grand Theft Auto V during {{a series of}} e-mails exchange with GameZone writer Lance Liebl during its launch week. The game happened to launch {{around the same time}} as the Washington Navy Yard shooting. Traditional media outlets such as FOX News sought out to find proof that violent video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V, had a role in the brutal killings. GameZone responded by writing an article that disagrees with this. These caught Thompson's attention, who then sent an e-mail to the site. [...] "Look, Lance," [...] he wrote in an email, [...] "The American Psychological Association has established a causal link between these games and increased aggression. The Dept. of Defense uses them for that purpose."

[...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, [...] "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by." [...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rest of the record. 'Don’t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones and a nice grooving back beat, and I love the way the song ends." ...|$|E

500|$|Mastras had Jesse buy a Roomba {{because he}} {{believed}} it was appropriate for Jesse's frame of mind: [...] "You don't need it, it's kind of inane. ...

[...] During the final shot of the episode, a steadicam shot filmed by Andrew Voegeli, Jesse turns his stereo system {{all the way up}} and leans directly against the pulsating speaker to try to shut out his pain. MacLaren wanted the speakers to pulse, but they could not actually play loud music without harming actor Aaron Paul. The special effects crew unsuccessfully tried several methods to make the speakers pulse, such as shaking them and pulling on strings, but they did not appear realistic. It was achieved after MacLaren visited a local stereo store and an employee provided her a bass tester which would run the stereo system with no noise, but cause the speakers to pulse as if music was playing. That employee was hired <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set and run the system, and the lights and pulsing were timed to match music which was later dubbed in.|$|E
500|$|Moon played {{few major}} poker games since the 2009 World Series of Poker, preferring instead to play local games among {{friends in the}} Oakland area.

[...] Moon joined 63 other players in the 2010 National Heads-Up Poker Championship at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. He paid the $20,000 buy-in from his {{personal}} funds. Moon was paired against online qualifier William Huntress {{in the first round}} of the tournament on March 5. ESPN writer Gary Wise said Huntress stood [...] "as good a chance of toppling an invited player as any qualifier ever has", and questioned why Moon participated in the tournament given Moon's past claims of disinterest in media exposure and sponsorship. However, PokerNews.com writer Mickey Doft predicted Moon would do well in the tournament due to his unpredictable play. Moon defeated Huntress when his [...] held out against Huntress' [...] The flop was , giving Huntress the better draw, but Moon won with king-high when another club failed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turn or river, advancing Moon to the second round.

500|$|Naomi later {{signed up}} for an {{internet}} dating website {{and used it to}} drive a wedge between Sonya and Toadie. Naomi found a guy she thought would be perfect for Sonya and then asked her and Toadie <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> date for moral support. Naomi's date ended up having an argument with Sonya, causing Toadie to apologise to Naomi for ruining her date and comforting her. Naomi continued to cause problems for Sonya and Toadie's marriage and when Sonya went away, Naomi decided to make her move. She invited herself over to Toadie's house, where they enjoyed watching DVDs together. Moloney explained that it was all innocent to begin with, but when they began trying out wrestling moves, Toadie should have realised {{that it was not a}} good idea. However, Toadie did not stop Naomi and she pinned him to the floor and kissed him. Moloney admitted that Toadie was [...] "mortified" [...] by the kiss, but it made him realise that he has no emotional investment in Naomi at all. Sheila then told Toadie that Naomi had been trying to seduce him for weeks and Toadie felt [...] "duped." [...] Moloney said [...] "He trusted Naomi and appreciated their friendship, and now he's been blindsided. He feels utterly betrayed when he discovers the whole situation was premeditated." ...|$|E

500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding the right people and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go. ... I think the energy has <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set at the very last minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{strand of}} [...] "left" [...] {{criticism}} tends <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand, from the ideological 'hard' left [...] "whose trenchant criticism of de Morais derives partly from [...] apparent {{neglect of the}} exploitative features of the capitalist mode of production, while there is open admiration for [...] organizing method" [...] and, on the other hand, from what could be broadly termed the [...] "liberation theology/Freirean conscientization" [...] stream of practice, which de Morais encountered when working with the MST (Landless Workers) Movement in Brazil.
