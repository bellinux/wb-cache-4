50|$|The Hunterdon Central Regional High School School District {{was created}} by {{referendum}} on April 4, 1954, and the high school opened in the former Route 69 Elementary School in September, 1956.

Before 1956, public school students of the school districts of Delaware, East Amwell and Readington Townships were sent to Flemington High School as tuition students, but these districts had no voice on the Flemington-Raritan Board of Education, which administered the school. Additionally, Flemington High's facilities could no longer support the growing student population, nor could its plant support the offering of a more broad-based curriculum that was becoming standard among American high schools in the post-WWII era.

Assuming uncoordinated maximization of domestic welfare, national governments wish to deviate (i) from inefficient laissez-faire equilibria as well as (ii) from efficient equilibria in which domestic distortions are internalized.

50|$|Methodologically, the LC4MP uses {{three primary}} sets of {{measures}} {{to study how}} people allocate resources and process information. Secondary task reaction time (STRT) {{is a measure of}} the amount of resources allocated to attention. STRT involves people engaging in a primary task such as watching TV while also monitoring a second task such as pressing a button whenever a cue such as a tone sounds or a light comes on. The amount of resources that are available (i.e., resources allocated minus resources required) has been demonstrated to influence how long it takes people to respond in the STRT. When there are a lot of resources available, people quickly notice the light or tone and are quick to press a button. But when resources are low or taxed, people take longer to notice the light or tone and are slower to respond. For example, a cut to an unrelated scene tends to <b>tax</b> <b>resources</b> because of the new information that needs to be processed, and STRT is slower. Critically, STRT is a function of both the resources allocated to the task and the resources required by the task.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{resources}} are typically subject both to taxation under {{the income tax}} system and to special <b>resource</b> <b>taxes.</b> Properly designed income taxes attempt to include capital income on a uniform basis. But in most countries the income <b>tax</b> treats <b>resource</b> industries more favorably than most other industries - through favorable treatment of such capital expenses as depletion, exploration and development, {{and the cost of}} acquiring resource properties. The case for special <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> is precisely to <b>tax</b> <b>resource</b> rents over and above the levies implicit in general income taxes. There are two justifications for this: (a) the efficiency-based argument that a <b>tax</b> on <b>resource</b> rents is nondistorting and complementary; and (b) the equity argument that the property rights to resources ought to accrue to the public at large rather than to private citizens since the rents represent the bounty nature has bestowed on the economy rather than a reward for economic effort. If the main purpose of a <b>resource</b> <b>tax</b> is to capture rents for the public sector, the base of <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> should be economic rents (or their present value equivalent), contend the authors. Actual <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> differ from rent taxes in significant ways. Unlike a general income tax - which allows the resource industries to understate capital income - <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> often overstate rents. This is because they typically do not offer full deductions for all costs, especially capital costs. Some systems tax revenues without allowing any deductions for costs; others allow the deduction of current costs only. As a result, they discourage investment activity in resource industries, encourage the exploitation of high-grade relative to low-grade resources, and make it difficult to impose high tax rates for fear of making the marginal tax rate higher than 100 percent. The authors discuss three alternative ideal ways for the government to divert a share of rents to the public sector: levy a tax on rents, ideally {{in the form of a}} cash flow tax; require firms to bid for the rights to exploit resources; and take a share of equity in the firm. They discuss these options in terms of their implications for the ability of firms to obtain finance, the allocation of risk, the share of rents accruing to the public sector, the extent of involvement of foreign firms, and other factors. The time has come in many countries, they say, when gains from further refinement of imperfect existing <b>taxes</b> on <b>resources</b> are less than replacing them with simpler, more efficient forms of pure rent taxes.

40|$|The {{property}} tax {{is currently a}} significant public education funding source, providing roughly 30 % of total public education funding. Examined another way, in tax year 2009, local taxing entities imposed about $ 2. 5 billion in {{property tax}}es statewide. School districts imposed about 54 % of that total, or about $ 1. 3 billion. This briefing paper examines school property taxes in Utah, including {{a review of the}} property tax base, property tax rates, and property tax revenues for schools. In addition, it summarizes existing equalization programs established to mitigate the disparity in property <b>tax</b> <b>resources</b> among local educational entities and concludes with some issues that policymakers may wish to consider when examining the state’s education funding system. PROPERTY TAX BASE School property <b>tax</b> <b>resources</b> vary significantly throughout the state.

Although they are public schools, charter schools have no property tax base and therefore cannot impose property taxes. Differences in the property tax base among school districts are due to many factors, such as: • general differences in fair market value in different areas; • different mixes of property types that tend to have different values (such as commercial and residential property); and • varying property tax treatment of different types of property due to exemption or special valuation treatment (such as primary residential property being taxed at 55 % of fair market value and certain agricultural property at its value for agricultural use) ...|$|E
