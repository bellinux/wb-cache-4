5|$|Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra {{together}} {{formed a}} single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were dissolved into the Republic over {{the first half of}} 1950. An abortive anti-Republic coup in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous Pasundan state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in Makassar during the Makassar Uprising in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> as a unitary state.|$|E

25|$|Efforts by the Dutch to find {{a federal}} {{solution}} for Indonesia included {{the establishment of the}} State of East Indonesia or Negara Indonesia Timur (NIT) in 1946. Mononutu {{became a member of the}} NIT parliament and headed the group of parliament members who were pro-republic. He focused his efforts to persuade other members of parliament to support the notion of unifying NIT with <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia.</b> After the Dutch military offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> called Operation Product or Agresi Militer Belanda I in 1947, Mononutu established the Unified Struggle for Indonesian Independence or Gabungan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan Indonesia. This organization sought to highlight the actions of the Dutch to keep Indonesia as its colony. In February 1948, he led a delegation of NIT officials to visit and meet with the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> in Yogyakarta. In 1949, NIT became a constituent of the newly formed United States of Indonesia or Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS), which was then dissolved on 17 August 1950 and replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|In February 1958 a {{coup attempt}} was made by pro-U.S. forces amongst the {{military}} and the political right-wing.

This so-called Revolutionary Government immediately began arresting thousands of PKI members in the areas under their control. PKI supported the efforts by Sukarno to quell the rebellion, including introduction of martial law. The rebellion was eventually defeated.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{military}} {{also provided}} Indonesian youth with military training and weapons, including {{the formation of}} a volunteer army called PETA (Pembela Tanah Air– Defenders of the Homeland). The Japanese military training for Indonesian youth originally was meant to rally local support for the collapsing power of the Japanese Empire, but later became the significant resource for <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> during the Indonesian National Revolution, and also {{led to the formation of}} Indonesian National Armed Forces in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{officer corps}} {{of the armed}} forces was {{estimated}} at 53,000 in 1992. Less than 1 percent of these were of general officer ranks. The Armed Forces Academy of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> ("AKABRI"), the national military academy at Magelang, Jawa Tengah Province trains most military officer corps. Other military academies are the Naval Academy ("A.A.L") in Surabaya and the Air Force Academy ("A.A.U") in Jogjakarta. Mandatory retirement exists for officers at the age of fifty-eight and routine periodic reassignments are enforced.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{between the}} two {{countries}} reached a low point following East Timor's secession from Indonesia in 1999. Following a United Nations agreement between <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> and Portugal, a UN-supervised referendum held on 30 August 1999 offered a choice between autonomy within Indonesia and full independence. The people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence. An Australian-led and Indonesian-sanctioned peacekeeping force, INTERFET, was sent into the territory to restore order following a violent 'scorched-earth' policy carried out by pro-integration militia and supported by elements of the Indonesian military.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, many Indonesian nationalists {{were based}} in Melbourne. Following the Japanese surrender, Australian forces {{participated in the}} {{occupation}} of eastern Indonesia in coordination with the British Southeast Asia Command's occupation of Java. As Allies during the War, Australia and Britain say they were both under obligations to help the Netherlands restore their occupation over the former Dutch East Indies. Australian forces participated in the Borneo campaign alongside US forces against the Japanese, including the Battle of Balikpapan in 1945. On 17 August 1945, Indonesian nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammed Hatta proclaimed the independence of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|East Timor {{owes its}} {{territorial}} distinctiveness {{from the rest}} of Timor, and the Indonesian archipelago as a whole, to being colonised by the Portuguese, rather than the Dutch; an agreement dividing the island between the two powers was signed in 1915. Colonial rule was replaced by the Japanese during World War II, whose occupation spawned a resistance movement that resulted in the deaths of 60,000 people, 13 percent of the population at the time. Following the war, the Dutch East Indies secured its independence as <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> and the Portuguese, meanwhile, re-established control over East Timor.|$|E

25|$|From the 1950s to 1960s <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia</b> {{struggled}} {{to maintain its}} unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements in some of its provinces. From 1948 to 1962, the TNI was involved in local warfare in West Java, Aceh, and South Sulawesi against Darul Islam/Tentara Islam Indonesia (DI/TII), a militant movement aimed at establishing an Islamic state in Indonesia. The TNI also helped bring the rebellion of Republic of South Maluku to a close in 1963. Meanwhile, the PRRI/Permesta rebellion holds an essential place in Indonesian military history because it was led by army officers in Sumatra and Sulawesi between 1955 and 1961.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional Government of East Timor was {{installed}} in mid-December 1975, consisting of APODETI and UDT leaders. Attempts by the United Nations Secretary General's Special Representative, Vittorio Winspeare Guicciardi to visit Fretilin-held areas from Darwin, Australia were obstructed by the Indonesian military, which blockaded East Timor. On 31 May 1976, a 'People's Assembly' in Dili, selected by Indonesian intelligence, unanimously endorsed an 'Act of Integration', and on 17 July, East Timor officially became the 27th province of <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indonesia.</b> The occupation of East Timor remained a public issue in many nations, Portugal in particular, and the UN never recognised either the regime installed by the Indonesians or the subsequent annexation.|$|E
