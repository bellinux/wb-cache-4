5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} {{period of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|$|E
5|$|Herne Bay {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line, which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other {{stations}} on this line include Broadstairs, Margate, Whitstable, Faversham, Gillingham, Rochester and Bromley South. Herne Bay is around 1hour and 40minutes from London. A National Express coach service also runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate, around every two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> during daytime. A selection of trains run to London's Cannon Street station, primarily for business commuting.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within one <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> of taking immediate-release metformin and {{four to eight}} hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E

5|$|The Aggie Band {{performs}} {{a new show}} each week during the football season and does not generally repeat drills from week to week. During the fall semester, the Aggie Band practices one <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> every weekday morning and on Saturdays every week with a football game. In addition, some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester. During weeks with complicated drills, extra practice and planning time is sometimes also done on weekday afternoons. All told, drills {{can take up to}} 40 hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps/ROTC activities.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> to complete.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Captain Philip Broke and HMS Shannon, a 38-gun frigate, were patrolling off {{the port}} of Boston on {{blockade}} duty. Shannon had been {{under the command of}} Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> each. Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded a pound (454g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allowable the crew to focus their fire on a specific target. In this regard Chesapeake, with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was greatly inferior.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E
5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E
5|$|In November, {{before the}} release of Frozen, Anna and Elsa began making {{appearances}} at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in Florida and California through meet and greets. In Walt Disney World, the attractions were {{set up in the}} Norway Pavilion of Epcot in recognition of the Scandinavian cultural elements that went into the film's design. In Disneyland, a winter-themed cottage was set up in the Fantasyland section, with a talking audio-animatronic Olaf sitting on the cottage roof. In February 2014, these meet-and-greet sessions were extended indefinitely, with wait time to meet the princesses frequently exceeding two hours, which is longer than any previous Disney characters. Additionally, Elsa, Anna, and Olaf were given a Frozen-themed float for Disneyland Paris' Disney Magic on Parade. On March 9, 2014, the three made appearances again on their own Frozen parade float in Festival of Fantasy Parade at Magic Kingdom theme park. On April 20, 2014, Anna and Elsa moved from Epcot to the Princess Fairytale Hall at Magic Kingdom, with wait time to see the characters amounted <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> compared to Cinderella's and Rapunzel's 15 minutes.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E

5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring animal in the Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while carrying over their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. The timer starts out at seven in-game days, but can be extended {{to a maximum of}} thirteen days. The timer stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
