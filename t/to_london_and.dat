5|$|The coastal {{resort and}} port town of Ramsgate was {{historically}} {{served by a}} complex network of unconnected railway lines, the legacy of competition between two rival companies to provide links <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> to neighbouring Margate. The town's first railway station, Ramsgate Town, was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 13April 1846, on {{what was then the}} outskirts of the town, about a mile from the seafront.

5|$|After {{taking part}} in the Gallipoli Campaign, Playford and his {{battalion}} left for France on 15 March 1916.

Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the shrapnel that had penetrated his body, although some of it remained within him, and his hearing was permanently damaged. Turning down an offer for a staff job in India, Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in Belgium and France.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see <b>to</b> <b>London,</b> <b>and</b> instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{existing}} line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, {{operation of the}} Brill Tramway {{was taken over by}} London's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol <b>to</b> <b>London,</b> <b>and</b> following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E

The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> the King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.|$|E
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned <b>to</b> <b>London</b> <b>and</b> treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
