50|$|The final {{form of the}} Western {{tradition}} recounts that Saint Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus {{along the}} Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin sudor) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Cross. According to some versions, St. Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor Tiberius and the veil possessing the Grace of God, was able to quench <b>thirst,</b> <b>cure</b> blindness, and even raise the dead.|$|E
50|$|Eventually the {{questions}} {{lead up to}} the conclusion that the man had the hiccups, and that his reason for requesting a drink of water was not to quench his <b>thirst</b> but to <b>cure</b> his hiccups. The bartender realized this and chose instead to cure the hiccups by frightening the man with the gun. Once the man realized that his hiccups were gone, he no longer needed a drink of water, gratefully thanked the bartender, and left.|$|R
2500|$|According {{to local}} tradition, Gwalior owes {{its name to}} a sage of former times. Suraj Sen, a prince of the gurjar-pratihar clan of the eighth century, {{is said to have}} lost his way in the forest. On a secluded hill, he met an old man, the sage Gwalipa, whose {{influence}} almost took him by surprise. Upon asking the sage for some drinking water, he was led to a pond, where the waters not only quenched his <b>thirst</b> but <b>cured</b> him of leprosy. Out of gratitude, the prince wished to offer the sage something in return, and the sage asked him to build a wall on the hill to protect the other sages from wild animals which often disturbed their yajnas (or pujas). Suraj Sen later built a palace inside the fort, which was named [...] "Gwalior" [...] after the sage, and eventually the city that grew around the fort took the same name.|$|R
5000|$|Another grain {{preparation}} {{known as}} menedach {{was made by}} kneading grains and butter together into a type of paste and was known for its medicinal qualities, especially for monks on strict penitential diets. It {{may have been an}} early form of roux or perhaps a type of polenta. It could be spread on bread. It is described in the 12th century Icelandic saga Landnamabok in which Irish slaves prepare the food claiming that it will <b>cure</b> <b>thirst.</b> [...] "The Irish thralls found the expedient of kneading meal and butter and said it would quench the thirst. They called it minapak".|$|R
