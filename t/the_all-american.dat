5|$|After the season, Bancroft {{interviewed for}} the {{managerial}} {{job with the}} Cincinnati Reds; however, the Reds hired O'Farrell. Bancroft next managed the Sioux City Cowboys of the Class-A Western League in 1936. He appeared in one game for Sioux City as a player. Bancroft then managed the St. Cloud Rox of the Class-C Northern League in 1947.

5|$|Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Bancroft {{played in}} minor league {{baseball}} from 1909 through 1914, at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, he became player-manager of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season.

Rymkus was named to all-AAFC teams in 1947, 1948, and 1949. In 1948, when the Browns won all of their games, Brown took away Rymkus's defensive duties and made him exclusively an offensive tackle.

50|$|The 1921 NFL Championship controversy, {{known among}} Buffalo sports historians and fans as the Staley Swindle, is a dispute in which <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>All-Americans</b> unintentionally {{surrendered}} <b>the</b> 1921 APFA Championship {{title to the}} Chicago Staleys (later renamed the Chicago Bears). The controversy began {{at the conclusion of}} the 1921 season, when <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> finished <b>the</b> season with the best record in the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922). However, after losing what <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> owner had intended to be an exhibition game to the Staleys on December 4, 1921, <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> lost their title to Chicago on a tiebreaker.|$|R

And in July 1939, Heikkinen was elected with 846,943votes (fourth highest vote count of any player) to play in the annual game between the College All-Stars and the NFL New York Giants. The Ironwood Daily Globe boasted that residents of Michigan’s sparsely populated Gogebic Range had accounted for 25,000 of Heikkinen’s votes.|$|E
5|$|The LCRV {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} areas along the river, and there are numerous towns including Bullhead City, Arizona, Needles, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Here, many diversions draw from the river, providing water for both local uses and distant regions including the Salt River Valley of Arizona and metropolitan Southern California. The last major U.S. diversion is at Imperial Dam, where over 90percent of the river's remaining flow is moved into <b>the</b> <b>All-American</b> Canal to irrigate California's Imperial Valley, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Council is the {{permanent}} executive {{body of the}} Church's administration.

The Council is headed by a chairman (the current Metropolitan), and is composed of the OCA's chancellor, secretary, treasurer, and selected clergy and lay delegates.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> {{next game}} {{was against the}} All-Tonawanda Lumberjacks, who would join the APFA the {{following}} year. Anderson scored a rushing touchdown to put <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> up 7–0 {{at the end of}} the first quarter. <b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> followed up with three touchdowns in the next quarter. Anderson rushed for two, and running back Barney Lepper rushed for another one. Hughitt scored the All-Americans' last touchdown of the game in the third quarter when he rushed for a touchdown. The final score of the game was 35–0. This game was the Lumberjacks only loss of the season, and the only game in which they failed to score a point.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> had <b>the</b> Akron Pros {{as their}} next opponent. <b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> were tired from their {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Bob Nash of Akron was sold to <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low amount of fans, and the game would not have been {{profitable}} for the Pros. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce replaced Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a small crowd of 3,000 people. <b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> had an opportunity to score in the final minutes of the game. Fritz Pollard fumbled the ball, and Heinie Miller recovered it. Buffalo had the ball on the 12-yard-line, but the officials called the end of the game. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Pros, 14-0. They then {{boarded a}} train for Chicago, worn out {{and in no}} real condition to play the Staleys. Furthermore, several of <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> apparently bolted; <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> had restocked their roster from the officially defunct Detroit Tigers football team {{as a result of}} a moonlighting controversy between <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> and <b>the</b> Union Quakers of Philadelphia in November of that year; however, the Tigers re-formed on December 4 (the same day <b>the</b> <b>All-Americans</b> faced Chicago) and played the non-league Detroit Maroons to a scoreless tie. <b>The</b> <b>All-Americans</b> then lost to the Staleys, 10-7. Meanwhile, McNeil still believed his team was the AFPA's 1921 champion, and even invested in tiny gold footballs for his players to commemorate the achievement. After all, even with the loss, Buffalo was still 9-1-2, and Chicago was at the time still 8-1 -- a half-game behind Buffalo in the standings (Buffalo played more games earlier in the season). If the season ended that day, Buffalo would still have won the league title. Chicago, however, saw their opportunity, and swiftly scheduled two games in December: one against the Canton Bulldogs, and the other against their crosstown rivals, the Chicago Cardinals. Winning both would have propelled Chicago to 10-1, a half-game ahead of Buffalo and assuring the team of the championship. The Staleys defeated Canton, 10-0, on December 11, but managed only to reach a scoreless tie with the Cardinals on December 18. Thus, the two teams were now tied at 9-1 (ties did not count in the APFA standings at the time).|$|R

5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for <b>the</b> <b>All-American</b> character.|$|E

Also, defensive end Murray Shelton recovered a fumble and returned it for a touchdown. Hughitt's rushing touchdown was the final score of the game.|$|R

5|$|Forrest {{is often}} bullied {{because of his}} {{physical}} disability and marginal intelligence. One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest {{to be a very}} fast runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on <b>the</b> <b>All-American</b> team, and meeting President John F.

After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over.

Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by <b>the</b> <b>all-American,</b> hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved.

Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory.|$|E
