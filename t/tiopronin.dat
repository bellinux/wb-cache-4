50|$|Initial {{treatment}} is with adequate hydration, alkalization of the urine with citrate supplementation or acetazolamide, and dietary modification to reduce salt and protein intake (especially methionine). If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with an agent such as penicillamine. <b>Tiopronin</b> is another agent.Once renal stones have formed, however, the first-line {{treatment is}} ESWL (Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). If ESWL {{do not work}} efficiently surgery can be necessary. Both endoscopic surgery and conventional open-abdominal surgery {{have proven to be}} effective treatment modalities for patients with more advanced disease. Adequate hydration is the foremost aim of treatment to prevent cysteine stones. The goal is to increase the urine volume because the concentration of cystine in the urine is reduced which prevents cystine from precipitating from the urine and forming stones. People with cystine stones should consume 5 to 7 liters a day. The rationale behind alkalizing the urine is that cystine tends to stay in solution and causes no harm. In order to alkalize the urine, sodium biocarbonate has been used. One must be careful in alkalizing their urine because it could lead to other forms of stones in process of preventing cystine stones. Penicillamine is a drug that acts to form a complex with cystine that is 50 times more soluble than cystine itself. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) is performed via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm in diameter. Most of the time, cystine stones are too dense to be broken up by shock (ESWL) so PNL is needed.|$|E
50|$|Thiols. Thiol-containing small {{molecules}} {{are the most}} commonly adopted stabilizers in metal nanoparticle synthesis owing to {{the strong interaction between}} thiols and gold and silver. Glutathione {{has been shown to be}} an excellent stabilizer for synthesizing gold nanoclusters with visible luminescence by reducing Au3+ in the presence of glutathione with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Also other thiols such as <b>tiopronin,</b> phenylethylthiolate, thiolate α-cyclodextrin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bidentate dihydrolipoic acid are other thiolated compounds currently being used in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters. The size as well as the luminescence efficiency of the nanocluster depends sensitively on the thiol-to-metal molar ratio. The higher the ratio, the smaller the nanoclusters. The thiol-stabilized nanoclusters can be produced using strong as well as mild reductants. Thioled metal nanoclusters are mostly produced using the strong reductant sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Gold nanocluster synthesis can also be achieved using a mild reducant tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium (THPC). Here a zwitterionic thiolate ligand, D-penicillamine (DPA), is used as the stabilizer. Furthermore, nanoclusters can be produced by etching larger nanoparticles with thiols. Thiols can be used to etch larger nanoparticles stabilized by other capping agents. Dendrimers. Dendrimers are used as templates to synthesize nanoclusters. Gold nanoclusters embedded in poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) have been successfully synthesized. PAMAM is repeatedly branched molecules with different generations. The florescence properties of the nanoclusters are sensitively dependent on the types of dendrimers used as template for the synthesis. Metal nanoclusters embedded in different templates show maximum emission at different wavelengths. The change in florescence property is mainly due to surface modification by the capping agents. Although gold nanoclusters embedded in PAMAM are blue-emitting the spectrum can be tuned from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (NIR) region and the relative PAMAM/gold concentration and the dendrimer generation can be varied. The green-emitting gold nanoclusters can be synthesized by adding mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) into the prepared small gold nanoparticle solution. The addition of freshly reduced lipoic acid (DHLA) gold nanoclusters (AuNC@DHLA) become red-emitting fluorophores.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPeptidyglycine α-amidating monooxygenase is a copper- and zinc-dependent, bifunctional {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the {{cleavage}} of glycine-extended peptides or N-acylglycines to the corresponding amides and glyoxylate.

The produced colored iron (II) -ferrozine complex [system I] absorbs at 562 nm, while the iron (II) -di- 2 -pyridyl ketone- 2 -thiophenoylhydrazone complex [system II] absorbs at 656 nm.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of cystinuria is hampered by {{methods used to}} measure urinary lithogenicity. Most cystine assays cannot reliably distinguish cystine from soluble thiol drug–cysteine complexes. We used a solid-phase assay of urinary cystine capacity in a large sample of patients with cystinuria. A known amount of solid-phase cystine is added to urine. In supersaturated urine, cystine precipitates onto added crystals, so the solid phase recovered after incubation will be greater than that added. We studied the effect of cystine-binding thiol drugs (CBTD) to solubilize cystine and determined correlates of cystine capacity in patients who were and were not taking CBTD. Increasing concentrations of D-penicillamine, <b>tiopronin</b> and captopril dissolved cystine in urine with similar efficacy. A general linear model in which 24 h cystine excretion was the dependent variable showed that creatinine, urea nitrogen, and sodium excretions were associated with cystine excretion (P< 0. 02, all three). Urine volume, pH, and cystine excretion strongly correlated with cystine capacity (P< 0. 001). <b>Tiopronin</b> {{had no effect on}} supersaturation in a cross-sectional analysis. A subset of supersaturated samples, with negative cystine capacity, occurred mainly among women not taking CBTD. For this subset, capacity differed significantly between CBTD users and non-users; use of CBTD avoided extremes of supersaturation. Female enrichment in the supersaturated group was accounted for in part by underprescription of CBTD to women. This assay of cystine capacity was reliable in the presence of CBTD. It should be useful in monitoring patients’ response to dietary interventions and administration of fluid, citrate, and CBTD...|$|E

The patients in groups A, B, and C were treated with reduced glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine injection, and <b>tiopronin</b> injection, respectively. The efficacy, drug cost, and incidence of adverse events were compared between the three groups. An analysis of variance was used for comparison of continuous data between multiple groups, and the LSD t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between any two groups; the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between multiple groups. ResultsGroup A had a significantly higher overall response rate than groups B and C (90. 0 % vs 73. 3 %/ 76. 7 %, χ 2 = 2. 78 and 3. 75, both P＜ 0. 05).

40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} {{measurements and}} magnetic characterization {{studies have been}} carried out for two types of thiol-capped gold nanoparticles (NPs) with similar diameters between 2. 0 and 2. 5 nm and different organic molecules linked to the sulfur atom: dodecanethiol and <b>tiopronin.</b> In addition, Au NPs capped with tetraoctyl ammonium bromide have also been included in the investigation since such capping molecules weakly interact with the gold surface atoms and, therefore, this system {{can be used as a}} model for naked gold NPs; such particles presented a bimodal size distribution with diameters around 1. 5 and 5 nm. The plasmon resonance is non-existent for tiopronin-capped NPs, whereas a trace of such a feature is observed for NPs covered with dodecanethiol molecules and a bulk-like feature is measured for NPs capped with tetralkyl ammonium salts. These differences would indicate that the modification of the surface electronic structure of the Au NPs depends on the geometry and self-assembling capabilities of the capping molecules and on the electric charge transferred between Au and S atoms. Regarding the magnetization, dodecanethiol-capped NPs have a ferromagnetic-like behaviour, while the NPs capped with <b>tiopronin</b> exhibit a paramagnetic behaviour and tetralkyl ammonium-protected NPs are diamagnetic across the studied temperature range; straight chains with a well-defined symmetry axis can induce orbital momentum on surface electrons close to the binding atoms. The orbital momentum not only contributes to the magnetization but also to the local anisotropy, giving rise to permanent magnetism. Due to the domain structure of the adsorbed molecules, orbital momentum is not induced for tiopronin-capped NPs and the charge transfer only induces a paramagnetic spin component...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the synthesis, control, and stabilisation of iron oxide nanoparticles for biomedical applications using magnetic hyperthermia. A new understanding of the factors effecting nanoparticle growth in a coprecipitation methodology has been determined. This thesis challenges the highly cited Ostwald Ripening as the primary mechanism for nanoparticulate growth, and instead argues that in certain conditions, such as increasing reaction temperature, a coalescence mechanism could be favoured by the system. Whereas in a system with a slower rate of addition of the reducing agent, Ostwald ripening is the favoured mechanism. The iron oxide nanoparticles made in the study were stabilised and functionalised for the purpose of stability in physiological environments using either carboxylic acid or phosphonate functionalised ligands. It was shown that phosphonate ligands form a stronger attachment to the nanoparticle surface and promote increased stability in aqueous solutions, however, this affected the magnetic properties of the particles and made them less efficient heaters when exposed to an alternating magnetic fields. <b>Tiopronin</b> coated iron oxide nanoparticles were a far superior heater, being over four times more effective than the best commercially available product.

In addition, some, of these thiols contain a carboxyl group and are acidic, which should be considered in studying the reaction between RSNO and thiols. In the present study, the kinetics of thiol-mediated decomposition of RSNO was investigated in a commonly used phosphate buffer, phosphate buffered saline (PBS; containing 6. 9 mM phosphates; buffer capacity= 3. 8 mM/pH). The thiols studied can be divided into 2 groups, depending on their pH perturbation capacity. The kinetics was studied using a wide range of thiol concentrations (ie, from 0. 1 to 10 mM). A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to determine RSNO concentrations. The results showed that the acidic thiols, including glutathione, captopril, N-acetylcysteine, and <b>tiopronin,</b> stimulated RSNO decomposition at low millimolar concentrations up to 2 mM. The stimulatory effect, however, became attenuated at concentrations higher than 2 mM in PBS. Increasing the concentration of acidic thiols caused a decrease in solution pH, which was attributable, to the inhibitory effect at high thiol concentrations. The effect of thiols on the pH of reaction solution, and the resulting bell-shaped rate profiles, can be predicted by a quantitative analysis, from which a comparison of the intrinsic reactivity toward RSNO, among 8 thiols, was possible.

In the synthetic approach the thiols attached to the gold nanoparticles were <b>tiopronin</b> and glutathione. The photosensitisers attached to the thiols were toluidine blue and tin chlorin e 6 respectively. It was found gold-tiopronin-toluidine blue nanoparticles at 1 µM concentration were efficient as light activated antimicrobials, that had a reduction of colony forming units (cfu) of S. aureus by 4. 5 log 10 compared with, 0. 5 log 10 for toluidine blue at the same concentration. The attachment of photosensitisers to thiol protected gold nanoparticles enhanced the lethal photosensitisation of bacteria. The second approach was mixing of charge stabilised gold nanoparticles with various photosensitisers. When charge stabilised gold nanoparticles when mixed with toluidine blue (20 µM), showed a reduction in colony forming units (cfu) for S. aureus of 2. 5 log 10 compared with 1. 5 log 10 for only toluidine blue at the same concentration. This established that covalent attachment of the photosensitiser was not necessary for the enhancement in the lethal photosensitisation of bacteria. Also, {{it was discovered that}} certain dyes which have basic, cationic natures have different interactions with charge stabilised gold nanoparticles. A separate study focusing on semi-conductor quantum dots and the photosensitiser toluidine blue was undertaken to investigate any relationship between nanoparticles and photosensitisers. It was found that semi-conductor quantum dots enhance the effect of toluidine blue in the lethal photosensitisation of bacteria. An excess of a 1. 7 log 10 enhancement in bacterial kill was observed with quantum dot concentration of 0. 0075 µM and toluidine blue concentration of 20 µM. In summary, the efficacy of photosensitisers can be enhanced by the presence of nanoparticles of gold and CdSe. ...|$|E
40|$|We prospectively {{determined}} cystine crystal volume (Vcys) in urine specimens {{from all}} consecutive patients with cystine urolithiasis followed at our institution {{over the past}} decade, {{in order to assess}} its predictive value as to the risk of recurrent cystine stone formation. A total of 57 patients (29 males, 28 females) with homozygous cystinuria entered in the study between January 1990 and December 2000, including 15 children aged less than 15 years and 42 patients aged 15 years or more. The clinical and radiological course was followed until December 2001, for a total of 243 patient-years of follow-up. From study entry until the end of follow-up, we serially examined first voided morning urine specimens in all patients, with determination of the number of cystine crystals per mm 3, and the average size of crystals, thus allowing us to calculate Vcys using a simple formula based on crystal geometry. Recurrence was diagnosed on the basis of serial radiographic examinations using X-rays and echography. Overall, cystine crystals were present in 179 (39 %) of the 460 examined urine specimens. Cystine crystalluria was significantly more frequent among the 27 patients who developed new cystine stones (SF) than in the other 30 who remained stone-free (63. 3 vs 25. 5 % of samples, P or = 50 % of serially examined urine samples was more frequently found in patients with recurrent stone formation than in non-recurrent patients (24 / 27 vs 2 / 30, P or = 3, 000 micro 3 /mm 3 was observed at least once prior to each of the 63 stone recurrences observed in 27 patients (2. 3 per patient on the average). In addition, Vcys reflected the efficacy of treatment, with Vcys mean values of 12, 097 +/- 3, 214 micro 3 /mm 3 at baseline, falling to 2, 648 +/- 658 micro 3 /mm 3 on basic therapy (hyperdiuresis plus alkalinization) alone, 1, 141 +/- 522 micro 3 /mm 3 on <b>tiopronin</b> therapy (median dose 1, 000 mg/day) and 791 +/- 390 micro 3 /mm 3 on D-penicillamine therapy (median dose 900 mg/day) whereas captopril had no effect (5, 114 +/- 2, 128 micro 3 /mm 3). Based on {{the results of the present}} study, cystine crystalluria appears to accurately reflect active stone formation in cystinuric patients. Determination of total Vcys provides a simple, cheap and accurate means of predicting the risk of cystine stone recurrence with a Vcys value > or = 3000 micro 3 /mm 3 as the threshold risk value. We propose that serial Vcys determination be performed simultaneously with the measurement of urine pH and specific gravity to optimally monitor the medical treatment of cystine patients...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} the proportion, causes {{and the nature}} of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with notably elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). METHODS: All the inpatients with ALT levels above 10 times upper limit of normal range (ULN) were retrospectively identified from a computerized clinical laboratory database at our hospital covering a 12 -mo period. Relevant clinical information was obtained from medical records. Alternative causes of ALT elevations were examined for each patient, including biliary abnormality, viral hepatitis, hemodynamic injury, malignancy, DILI or undetermined and other causes. All suspected DILI cases were causality assessed using the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, and only the cases classified as highly probable, probable, or possible were diagnosed as DILI. Comments related to the diagnosis of DILI in the medical record and in the discharge letter for each case were also examined to evaluate DILI detection by the treating doctors. RESULTS: A total of 129 cases with ALT > 10 ULN were identified. Hemodynamic injury (n = 46, 35. 7 %), DILI (n = 25, 19. 4 %) and malignancy (n = 21, 16. 3 %) were the top three causes of liver injury. Peak ALT values were lower in DILI patients than in patients with hemodynamic injury (14. 5 1; 5. 6 ULN vs 32. 5 1; 30. 7 ULN, P = 0. 001). Among DILI patients, one (4 %) case was classified as definite, 19 (76 %) cases were classified as probable and 5 (20 %) as possible according to the CIOMS scale. A hepatocellular pattern was observed in 23 (92 %) cases and mixed in 2 (8 %). The extent of severity of liver injury was mild in 21 (84 %) patients and moderate in 4 (16 %). Before discharge, 10 (40 %) patients were recovered and the other 15 (60 %) were improved. The improved patients tended to have a higher peak ALT (808 1; 348 U/L vs 623 1; 118 U/L, P = 0. 016) and shorter treatment duration before discharge (8 1; 6 d vs 28 1; 12 d, P = 0. 008) compared with the recovered patients. Twenty-two drugs and 6 herbs were found associated with DILI. Antibacterials were the most common agents causing DILI in 8 (32 %) cases, followed by glucocorticoids in 6 (24 %) cases. Twenty-four (96 %) cases received treatment of DILI with at least one adjunctive drug. Agents for treatment of DILI included anti-inflammatory drugs (e. g., glycyrrhizinate), antioxidants (e. g., glutathione, ademetionine 1, 4 -butanedisulfonate and <b>tiopronin),</b> polyene phosphatidyl choline and herbal extracts (e. g., protoporphyrin disodium and silymarin). Diagnosis of DILI was not mentioned in the discharge letter in 60 % of the cases. Relative to prevalent cases and cases from wards of internal medicine, incident cases and cases from surgical wards had a higher risk of missed diagnosis in discharge letter [odds ratio (OR) 32. 7, 95 %CI (2. 8 - 374. 1), and OR 58. 5, 95 %CI (4. 6 - 746. 6), respectively]. CONCLUSION: DILI is mostly caused by use of antibacterials and glucocorticoids, and constitutes about one fifth of hospitalized patients with ALT > 10 ULN. DILI is underdiagnosed frequently...|$|E
