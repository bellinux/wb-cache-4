5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E

The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation.

This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E

Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, {{one of the major}} structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E

It is also forbidden to use any symbol <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.|$|E

5|$|Although Faversham Abbey was {{dissolved}} by Henry VIII {{the nearby}} St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church remains, {{and has been}} a Grade I listed building since 1950. The church was established in 1147 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda, with a distinctive spire added around 1794 – 97 <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> seen from many places around town. The interior was restored in the mid-19th century by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who redesigned the nave and transepts and added a stone encasing to the spire. The church reputedly contains the remains of King Stephen, which were recovered from Faversham Creek after the dissolution of the abbey. The church holds an altar dedicated to Saints Crispin and Crispinian, who reportedly fled to Faversham in the 3rd century.|$|E
