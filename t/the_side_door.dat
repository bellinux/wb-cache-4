The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel {{cans and}} boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used GPS to locate their targets, then pushed ordinance through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> One {{of the aircraft}} was shot down by an SA-6 missile, killing Marko Živković, {{the commander of the}} air unit.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E

25|$|The Labrador {{was fitted}} with a {{watertight}} hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured a 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18-person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs {{and the need for}} prompt replacement. In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by Boeing Canada in Arnprior, Ontario. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, a tail-mounted auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and front-mounted searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.|$|E
25|$|At 6:35 a.m., the {{helicopters}} approached {{the area where}} O'Grady's signal beacon had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O'Grady had set off a flare. The first Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 Marines jumped off the aircraft {{and set up a}} defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion landed, a figure with a pistol {{who turned out to be}} the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.|$|E
25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before Lugosi's {{death in}} August 1956, {{he had been}} working with Wood on {{numerous}} half-realized projects, variously titled Tomb of the Vampire or The Ghoul Goes West. Scenes unconnected to Plan 9, featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking in and out of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like Plan 9 in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about Ghoul being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
2500|$|A {{campaign}} to recall Cryer in 1927 {{was led by}} the City Planning Commissioner, Estelle Holman, and rumors spread that Cryer was [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "weary" [...] of the job, and that an [...] "Unknown Committee of Twenty-Five" [...] had formed to tell [...] "the Parrot-Cryer lame-duck city 'administration' to ease the Mayor out of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> of the City Hall." ...|$|E

[...] Its [...] "styling was different and appealing in an offbeat sort of way" [...] featuring large amounts of glass. The Pacer's low beltline prevented <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> window from lowering completely out of sight, so Teague designed the inner door panels with large bolsters."

5000|$|The {{church was}} built of English red bricks with local oyster shell mortar. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on October 30, 1745. The nave has a rectangular plan with five bays. The center bays have <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> with fanlights {{and the others}} have windows with fanlights. Brick pilasters flank <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and are {{at the corners of}} the church. The roof is hipped over the sanctuary and has a Jacobean or Dutch gable at the entrance. The nave has a plastered, barrel-vaulted ceiling. The pews are paneled, wooden box pews. There is a center aisle and a cross aisle at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> floor is flagstone. [...] The first service was held on August 16, 1747.|$|R
2500|$|Even loose loads such as coal, {{grain and}} ore {{can be carried}} in a boxcar with boards over <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> openings. [...] Later grain {{transport}} would use metal reinforced cardboard which was nailed over the door and could be punctured by a grain auger for unloading. This was more common in earlier days; it was susceptible to losing much loading during the journey, and damaged the boxcar. It was also impossible to mechanically load and unload. Grain can also be transported in boxcars designed specifically for that purpose; specialized equipment and procedures are required to load and unload the cars. However grain is better transported in covered hopper cars.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{structural}} improvement was a stronger design for <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels (which was also optional with the Monte Carlo), {{as was the}} instrument gauge cluster. A power moonroof was an option 1973-75. Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by [...] Rear seat legroom was up [...] in sedans. Another was a [...] luggage capacity, an increase of [...] over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.|$|E
2500|$|While {{an unarmed}} Kennaway {{physically}} restrained the driver, Glennon, {{armed with the}} Derringer, gave cover beside the van as [...] McWilliams opened <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: [...] "Armed INLA volunteers". With {{a smile on his}} face, he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver. Wright had been {{in the middle of a}} conversation, discussing the [...] "cost of Christmas", with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to [...] "fuck up and sit in his seat" [...] and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to [...] "get down", but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He slumped against the legs of Green. After screaming [...] "they shot Billy", Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was brought to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and surrendered to prison guards. They handed over a statement:Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [...]|$|E
