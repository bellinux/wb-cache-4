50|$|Timing relays are {{arranged}} for an intentional delay in operating their contacts. A very short (a {{fraction of a}} second) delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly. Current flowing in the disk maintains magnetic field for a short time, lengthening release time. For a slightly longer (up to a minute) delay, a dashpot is used. A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly; both air-filled and oil-filled dashpots are used. The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate. For longer time periods, a mechanical clockwork timer is installed. Relays may be arranged for a fixed timing period, or may be field adjustable, or remotely set from a control panel. Modern microprocessor-based <b>timing</b> <b>relays</b> provide precision <b>timing</b> over a great range.|$|R

Because hosts do not habitually produce strong responses all the time, immune responses might be costly to produce or maintain. We tested experimentally if {{the production of a}} response to a challenge with a novel antigen resulted in a cost in terms of fitness using the highly colonial house martin Delichon urbica as a model system. We injected adult breeding birds during laying of the first clutch with either Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or a control injection, and the clutch was subsequently removed to induce relaying. NDV stimulates the non-specific immune system, causing production of antibodies during a period of more than 2 weeks. Accordingly, we found an increase in leukocyte counts in experimental birds compared to controls. Experimental treatment reduced the frequency of re-laying, caused a delay in <b>timing</b> of <b>relaying</b> and a reduction in brood size. Quality of nestlings in terms of body size, body mass and T-cell-mediated immune response did not differ significantly between treatments. Overall, seasonal reproductive success differed significantly between treatments, showing that the production of an immune response by adult birds is costly in terms of future fecundity...|$|R

Based on extended orthogonal spacetime block coding (EO-STBC), we have presented a direct quantized feedback approach that can achieve full cooperative diversity and array gain with unity code rate over each hop. In this scheme, we have employed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) type pre-coding at the source node to combat multipath fading and <b>timing</b> errors from <b>relay</b> nodes by using cyclic prefix insertion for the broadcasted and relayed signals. To reduce the feedback overhead significantly we have proposed a quantized group feedback approach which can enhance the system performance.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} space-time block coding (STBC) {{transmission}} scheme for asynchronous cooperative systems. By combination of rotated complex constellations and Hadamard transform, these constructed codes {{are capable of}} achieving full cooperative diversity with {{the analysis of the}} pairwise error probability (PEP). Due to the asynchronous characteristic of cooperative systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique with cyclic prefix (CP) is adopted for combating <b>timing</b> delays from <b>relay</b> nodes. The total transmit power across the entire network is fixed and appropriate power allocation can be implemented to optimize the network performance. The relay nodes do not require decoding and demodulation operation, resulting in a low complexity. Besides, there is no delay for forwarding the OFDM symbols to the destination node. At the destination node the received signals have the corresponding STBC structure on each subcarrier. In order to reduce the decoding complexity, the sphere decoder is implemented for fast data decoding. Bit error rate (BER) performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{near field}} {{communication}} (NFC) has expanded as rapidly as Bluetooth or similar technologies and {{shows no signs of}} slowing down. It is used in many different systems such as contactless payment processing, movie posters, security access and passport identification. NFC enabled devices include cell phones, credit cards and key chains. With the spread of any new technology come security vulnerabilities that malicious users will try to exploit. NFC is particularly vulnerable to what is known as a relay attack. The relay attack is similar to the man-in-the-middle attack but the data need not be unencrypted to be vulnerable. The relay attack is currently undetectable and unstoppable. Many solutions have been proposed but no real-world solution has been found that does not require significant changes to the NFC protocol, or even the hardware. In this work we propose a technique that uses careful timing analysis of tag communication to identify a transaction as dangerous and thus set off an alert of the potential threat. This could be built into mobile devices and readers already deployed and provide a level of security to the market not currently available while maintaining the protocols set forth by the ISO. A proof of concept has been built and tested on custom hardware as well as on an Android Nexus 4 to detect and prevent the relay attack. In this thesis we give an overview of security issues in NFC communication, describe the relay attack in detail, present our timing based countermeasures and its implementation, and give results of our evaluation of <b>timing</b> based <b>relay</b> prevention...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{selected}} {{for differences in}} nest-building behavior differ {{in the number of}} arginine-vasopressin (AVP) -immunoreactive neurons in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Although previous efforts to link AVP-immunoreactive neurons in the SCN to clock function have failed, we show that differences in several circadian parameters are associated with differences in the number of AVP-immunoreactive neurons between the selected lines. Although an alternative interpretation is discussed, we hypothesize that these neurons may <b>relay</b> <b>timing</b> information from the circadian pacemaker in the SCN for wheel-running activity. In addition, phase-response curves (PRCs) to 15 -min light pulses in constant darkness also differ between the selected lines. However, these differences are not associated with the number of the AVP-immunoreactive neurons in the SCN, but are associated with the level of nest-building behavior. Compared to the Brattleboro rat, in which homozygous rats are deficient for AVP in the entire brain, our system, exhibiting a wide range of variability, has more specific utility for studying the role of the output pathways of the SCN in circadian rhythm control. ...|$|R

In total 11 tunable cavities (10 operational and a hot spare, grouped into 3 + 1 tuning groups and up to presently 6 voltage program groups) are distributed all around the circumference of the PS ring.

These control signals are presently generated by a dedicated hardware matrix. It translates voltage functions and <b>relay</b> <b>timing</b> pulses per cavity group into functions and timings per cavity. However, due to its central position in the RF beam control system, the dedicated hardware matrix can cause significant downtime in case of a major hardware failure.

40|$|Clock output {{pathways}} play {{a pivotal}} role by <b>relaying</b> <b>timing</b> information from the circadian clock to a diversity of physiological systems. Both cell-autonomous and systemic mechanisms have been implicated as clock outputs; however, the relative importance and interplay between these mechanisms are poorly understood. The cell cycle represents a highly conserved regulatory target of the circadian timing system. Previously, we have demonstrated that in zebrafish, the circadian clock {{has the capacity to}} generate daily rhythms of S phase by a cell-autonomous mechanism in vitro. Here, by studying a panel of zebrafish mutants, we reveal that the pituitary-adrenal axis also plays an essential role in establishing these rhythms in the whole animal. Mutants with a reduction or a complete absence of corticotrope pituitary cells show attenuated cell-proliferation rhythms, whereas expression of circadian clock genes is not affected. We show that the corticotrope deficiency is associated with reduced cortisol levels, implicating glucocorticoids as a component of a systemic signaling pathway required for circadian cell cycle rhythmicity. Strikingly, high-amplitude rhythms can be rescued by exposing mutant larvae to a tonic concentration of a glucocorticoid agonist. Our work suggests that cell-autonomous clock mechanisms are not sufficient to establish circadian cell cycle rhythms at the whole-animal level. Instead, they act in concert with a systemic signaling environment of which glucocorticoids are an essential part...|$|R
40|$|Many synapses show {{short-term}} depression, {{but it is}} {{not well}} understood what functional purpose depression serves and whether its effects are beneficial or detrimental to information processing. We study this issue at the synapse made by auditory-nerve (AN) fibers onto bushy cells (BCs) of the cochlear nucleus, called the “endbulb of Held. ” AN fibers carry timing information about sounds and converge on BCs, which <b>relay</b> <b>timing</b> information to brain areas responsible for sound localization. Dynamic-clamp recordings of BCs in mouse brain slices indicated that nonphase-locked inputs influenced the contribution of phase-locked inputs when all inputs had equal strength. We evaluated whether this situation depended on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Voltage-clamp recordings indicated that the amount of depression varied over the population of endbulbs, but sibling endbulbs terminating on the same BC had similar plasticity. We tested the effects of endbulb depression on BC spiking using dynamic clamp. Under most conditions, increasing depression led to lower probability of BC spiking. However, the effects on spike timing were highly context dependent. When all inputs carried uniform timing information, depression indirectly affected BC spike precision, by determining how many inputs were required to cross threshold. Earlier work has indicated that this interacts with the temporal distribution of inputs to determine BC spike precision. When inputs carried different timing information, depression greatly improved BC precision by suppressing highly active inputs carrying little phase-locked information. These data suggest that endbulbs with different depression characteristics could produce BCs that enhance response probability or timing under different stimulus conditions...|$|R

The principle aim of {{this research}} project is to measure parameters which are pertinent for numerical simulations in discontinuous media. One such numerical tool, the Discrete Element Method (DEM), is a promising technique for predicting the dynamics of charge motion with in a mill. Particle interactions in DEM are calculated by contact force and force displacement laws at each particle contact. These contact events are characterized by parameters that are often fitted or estimated {{due to the lack}} of accurate experimental measurements. The {{aim of this}} project is to experimentally measure the necessary interaction properties required for the DEM analysis and to test the DEM models against the measured experimental results. An in-ﬂight binary collisions drop tester is constructed to measure the material interaction properties of two spheres. The collision event is captured photographically and pre- and post- relative velocities are measured. The binary collisions of the particles are carefully controlled by <b>relay</b> <b>timing</b> circuits and they are captured on digitized images using a SLR digital camera. The particles are illuminated using digital strobes controlled by a signal generator. The heights of the colliding particles are adjusted to vary the drop velocities prior to collision. The measured relative velocities arc applied in rigid body theory of binary impact to extract the required material interaction properties. The parameters measured from the binary collision include coefficients of tangential and normal restitution and friction. The analysis presented here draws on the work of Maw et al and Foerster et al, which is an extension of the Hertz theory of impact to the oblique impact of the elastic bodies with circular contacts.

40|$|Many {{biological}} systems function {{based on two}} essential motifs: network interactions between cells and integration across timescales. Both of these are ubiquitous in coupled biological oscillators, such as in heart and brain tissues, which require communication and coordination between cellular oscillators across timescales in order to generate tissue-level rhythms. Mathematical modeling can provide invaluable insight in order to explain this complexity. In this dissertation, we develop a detailed model of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian (daily) pacemaker in mammals, and numerical methods for simulating it. This new multiscale model resolves the intracellular molecular events that generate circadian rhythms {{as well as the}} cellular electrical activity important for <b>relaying</b> <b>timing</b> information {{to the rest of the}} brain. The model not only reproduces experimental findings, but also makes several new predictions about the role of intercellular signaling in the SCN, some of which we experimentally validate. First, the model explains how intercellular signaling in the SCN increases robustness of tissue-level rhythms. Second, it proposes a new mechanism by which the SCN can differentially regulate intra-SCN synchrony and SCN output signals through a single neurotransmitter signaling on disparate timescales. Third, it shows how the response polarity of cells to this neurotransmitter changes depending on the particular daylength an animal has been entrained to. By modulating the response and the intrinsic period of subsets of SCN neurons, phase-locked populations of cells are used to encode the daylength of the entraining signal. Finally, the model predicts that a kinase can be used to modulate the firing rate of cells to control SCN output. On the whole, the model answers many open questions about signaling within the SCN and control of SCN output to the rest of the brain. It presents a holistic picture of the SCN as a robustly oscillating network with its synchrony and output signals modulated on two different timescales in response to the entraining light signal. The computational framework developed herein with parallelization using GPUs provides an important tool for circadian research, and a model computational system for the many multiscale projects currently studying brain function...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{development}} of devices and the development of data aggregation methods, data to be analyzed and aggregating methods have been changed. Regarding the environment of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors or devices are connected to the communication terminal as access point or mobile phone and the terminal aggregate the sensing data and upload them to the cloud server. From the viewpoint of analysis, the aggregated data are sequential data and the grouped sequence is a meaningful set of sequences because the group represents the owner 2 ̆ 7 s information. However, most of the researches for sequential data analysis are specialized for the target data, and not focusing on the "grouped" sequences. In addition from the viewpoint of aggregation, it needs to prepare the special terminals as an access point. The preparation of the equipment takes labor and cost. To analyze the "grouped" sequence and aggregate them without any preparation, this paper aims to realize the analysis method for grouped sequences and to realize the aggregation environment virtually. For analysis of grouped sequential data, we firstly analyze the grouped sequential data focusing on the event sequences and extract the requirements for their modeling. The requirements are (1) the order of events, (2) the duration of the event, (3) the interval between two events, and (4) the overlap of the event. To satisfy all requirements, this paper focuses on the Hidden Semi Markov Model (HSMM) as a base model because it can model the order of events and the duration of event. Then, we consider how to model these sequences with HSMM and propose its extensions. For the former consideration, we propose two models; duration and interval hidden semi-Markov model and interval state hidden-semi Markov model to satisfy both the duration of event and the interval between events simultaneously. For the latter consideration, we consider how to satisfy all requirements including the overlap of the events and propose a new modeling methodology, over-lapped state hidden semi-Markov model. The performance of each method are shown compared with HSMM from the view point of the training and recognition time, the decoding performance, and the recognition performance in the simulation experiment. In the evaluation, practical application data are also used in the simulation and it shows the effectiveness. For the data aggregation, most of conventional approaches for aggregating the grouped data are limited using pre-allocated access points or terminals. It can obtain the grouped data stably, but it needs to additional cost to allocate such terminals in order to aggregate a new group of sequences. Therefore, this paper focus on "area based information" as a target of the grouped sequences, and propose an extraordinary method to store such information using the storage of the terminals that exist in the area. It realize the temporary area based storage virtually by relaying the information with existing terminals in the area. In this approach, it is necessary to restrict the labor of terminals and also store the information as long as possible. To control optimally while the trade-off, we propose methods to control the <b>relay</b> <b>timing</b> {{and the size of the}} target storage area in ad hoc dynamically. Simulators are established as practical environment to evaluate the performance of both controlling method. The results show the effectiveness of our method compared with flooding based relay control. As a result of above proposal and evaluation, methods for the grouped sequential data modeling and its aggregation are appeared. Finally, we summarize the research with applicable examples. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
