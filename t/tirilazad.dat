40|$|This study {{leads to}} the {{following}} conclusions: a variation of effective hepatic blood flow between the groups during respectively after cardiopulmonary bypass could not be monitored. During cardiopulmonary bypass a significant reduction of the ICG-extraction fraction – possibly {{as a result of}} a dysfunction in microcirculation – was observed. A significantly better secretory liver function could not be achieved by <b>Tirilazad</b> treatment. The liver’s ability to extract Lactate from the blood was influenced by neither cardiopulmonary bypass nor <b>Tirilazad</b> treatment. Also its ability to synthesize Monoethylglycinxylidide from Lidocaine was not effectet by cardiopulmonary bypass or <b>Tirilazad.</b> Elimination of Mannitol in the Placebo group decreases sigificantly on the day after surgery which indicates that the funktionelle Oberfläche des Dünndarms was possibly reduced during the process. There ist no significant decline in the elimination of mannitol in the <b>Tirilazad</b> group. As the data of the postoperative day in this group show a wide variance, a protective effect of <b>Tirilazad</b> on the integrity of the intestinal wall is not proven. Time depedent there is no change in the elimination of lactulose in the placebo group. On postoperative day in the <b>Tirilazad</b> group the elimination of lactulose augments, which indicates increased permeability of the small intestine. As also in this group the variance of data is wide on the postoperative day, this is probably random error. The Permeability-Index indicates an increase of permeability in the placebo group on the postoperative day. In the <b>Tirilazad</b> group no significant increase in Permeability-Index can be observed. This can be originated to the differences in elimination of lactulose. Elimination of Sucrose (which equates permeability of the stomach) does not change in the placebo group. However, the data are scattered widely on the postoperative day. In the <b>Tirilazad</b> group an increase in gastric permeability on the postoperative day can be seen.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We {{examined}} the cytoprotective {{effect of the}} lipid peroxidation inhibitor <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate (U 74006 F) in rodent models of neocortical infarction induced by transient and permanent focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Wistar rats (experiment 1) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (experiment 2) were subjected to 2 hours of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 22 hours of reperfusion and pretreated with 10 mg/kg i. p. <b>tirilazad,</b> vehicle, or saline. Repeat doses were given at 4 and 10 hours after reperfusion. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were also subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and either pretreated with <b>tirilazad,</b> vehicle, or saline intraperitoneally (experiment 3) or treated with either <b>tirilazad</b> or vehicle intravenously after ischemia (experiment 4). Cortical infarct volumes were measured 24 hours after the onset of either transient or permanent ischemia, and changes in core regional cerebral blood flow were monitored with laser Doppler flowmetry. RESULTS: <b>Tirilazad</b> reduced infarct volume after transient ischemia by 40 % in Wistar rats (p = 0. 08) (experiment 1) and 23 % in spontaneously hypertensive rats (p less than 0. 05) (experiment 2) but did not reduce infarction after permanent ischemia whether it was given intraperitoneally (experiment 3) or intravenously (experiment 4). Ischemic core blood flows were not affected during ischemia, nor were they affected during reperfusion after transient ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Tirilazad</b> reduces cortical infarction in transient but not permanent ischemia, an effect not related to improvement in regional cerebral blood flow. <b>Tirilazad</b> might prove to be useful as an adjuvant therapy after successful thrombolysis in acute stroke patients...|$|E

The survival of grafted dopamine neurons is only improved {{by a factor of}} 2 – 3 by adding neuroprotectants during tissue preparation. We used dye exclusion cell viability and electron microscopy to investigate the effects of the caspase inhibitor ac-YVAD-cmk and the lazaroid <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate on ultrastructural changes in dissociated embryonic mesencephalic cells. In addition, we examined whether the neuroprotectants selectively counteracted specific signs of neurodegeneration. Cell viability decreased significantly over time in both control and treated cell suspensions, but the number of viable cells remaining was significantly higher in <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate-treated cell suspensions. In control samples, the proportion of cells with an ultrastructure consistent with healthy cells decreased from 70 %, immediately after dissociation, to 30 % after 8 h of incubation. Similar changes were also observed in cell suspensions treated with neuroprotectants. Thus, the neuroprotectants examined did not block the development of specific morphological signs of neurodegeneration. However, when also taking into account that dead cells lysed and disappeared from each cell suspension with time, we found that the total number of remaining viable cells with healthy nuclear chromatin or intact membrane integrity was significantly higher in the <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate-treated group.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{membrane}} structural properties occurring {{during the process}} of ATP depletion-induced cell injury in adherent human astrocytoma cells (UC- 11 MG) were studied with two epifluorescence techniques: 1) steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) to examine microstructural changes in the membrane phospholipids and 2) fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) to examine membrane fluidity changes. A new method for r measurement was established that provides the unique advantage of simultaneously monitoring both vertical and horizontal polarized fluorescence emissions needed for the calculation of r. In this study, r in the astrocytoma cells labeled with 1 -(4 -trimethylammonium phenyl) - 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate was shown to remain stable for up to 90 min. However, when the cells were treated with 75 microM iodoacetic acid (IAA), a metabolic inhibitor that induces rapid depletion of cellular ATP, r continually decreased, indicating a decrease in membrane lipid order and perturbation of the bilayer structure. This decrease in r could be prevented by the pretreatment of cells with lipophilic antioxidants such as <b>tirilazad</b> or gossypol. <b>Tirilazad</b> itself caused a significant increase in r, suggesting that <b>tirilazad</b> intercalates into the membrane bilayer and profoundly increases the lipid order in uninjured cells. Gossypol, however, did not exhibit this property. Further investigations into these phenomena with FRAP confirmed the r results and indicated that membrane fluidity increased while its structure became less rigid {{during the process of}} ATP-induced cell injury. In addition, lipophilic antioxidants prevented the membrane structural aberrations induced by IAA. Experimental results suggest that different mechanisms of cytoprotective action may exist for <b>tirilazad</b> and the antioxidant gossypol. Gossypol appears to prevent or delay the observed cell injury entirely because of its antioxidant action, whereas tirilazad's protection is mediated not only via its antioxidant activity, but also by its ability to increase cell membrane lipid order...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{that much of the}} post-traumatic degeneration of the spinal cord following injury is caused by a secondary injury process that occurs during the first minutes, hours, and days after spinal cord injury (SCI). A key bio-chemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). Indeed, the administration of a high-dose regi-men of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP) has been shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, and to improve neurological recovery in spinal cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U. S. Neverthe-less, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI, since it was already on the U. S. market for many other indi-cations. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the nonglucocorti-coid 21 -aminosteroid <b>tirilazad</b> could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy has been obtained.

40|$|Five parkinsonian {{patients}} were transplanted bilaterally into the putamen and caudate nucleus with human embryonic mesencephalic tissue from between seven and nine donors. To increase graft survival, the lipid peroxidation inhibitor <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate {{was administered to}} the tissue before implantation and intravenously to the patients for 3 days thereafter. During the second postoperative year, the mean daily L-dopa dose was reduced by 54 % and the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) motor score in 'off' phase was reduced by a mean of 40 %. At 10 - 23 months after grafting, PET showed a mean 61 % increase of 6 -L-[(18) F]fluorodopa uptake in the putamen, and 24 % increase in the caudate nucleus, compared with preoperative values. No obvious differences {{in the pattern of}} motor recovery were observed between these and other previously studied cases with putamen grafts alone. The amount of mesencephalic tissue implanted in each putamen and caudate nucleus was 42 and 50 % lower, respectively, compared with previously transplanted patients from our centre. Despite this reduction in grafted tissue, the magnitudes of symptomatic relief and graft survival were very similar. These findings suggest that <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate may improve survival of grafted dopamine neurons in patients, which is in agreement with observations in experimental animals...|$|E
40|$|Major {{practical}} {{constraints on}} neural grafting in Parkinson's disease are {{the shortage of}} human donor tissue and the great loss of dopamine neurons during the grafting procedure. The vast majority of implanted embryonic dopamine neurons are believed to die {{within a few days}} of transplantation surgery, at least in part through apoptosis. We have previously found that survival of nigral grafts in rodents can be significantly augmented by pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk or by lazaroids (lipid peroxidation inhibitors). We now report that pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-cmk, but not z-VAD-fmk, results in a significantly improved survival of transplanted dopamine neurons of similar magnitude to that achieved in this study using Ac-YVAD-cmk (both 220 - 230 % of control). In addition, we found that treatment of the graft tissue with <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate (a lazaroid allowed for clinical use) almost doubled the survival of grafted dopamine neurons. When Ac-YVAD-cmk and <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate treatments were combined, the number of surviving dopamine neurons increased significantly further to 280 % of control. Importantly, the same combination of neuroprotectants enhanced the survival of human dopamine neurons xenotransplanted to immunosuppressed rats (to 240 % of control). In conclusion, these results suggest that combining treatments that counteract oxidative stress and caspase activation is a valuable strategy to enhance nigral graft survival that should be considered for clinical application...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Embryonic {{xenogeneic}} {{neural tissue}} {{is an alternative}} for transplantation in Parkinson's disease, but immune responses limit the application. The aims {{of this study were}} to enhance the in vitro viability rates by donor tissue pretreatment; to compare the efficacy of cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK) in inhibiting xenograft rejection in rats; to evaluate additional inductive therapy with prednisolone (PRE) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). METHODS: <b>Tirilazad</b> (a lipid peroxidase inhibitor) or FK and acYVAD-cmk (a caspase inhibitor), were added to embryonic porcine ventral mesencephalic tissue and viability was assessed in vitro. Tirilazad-treated tissue was grafted to the striatum of rats that were either left untreated or immunosuppressed with FK (1 mg/kg) or CsA (15 mg/kg) alone or in combination with a 2 -week PRE (20 mg/kg) or MMF (40 mg/kg) induction course. Xenograft survival and host responses were determined using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Pretreatment with <b>tirilazad</b> enhanced tissue survival in vitro. After transplantation into untreated controls, there was no graft survival at twelve weeks. Neural cell counts were significantly improved in immunosuppressed recipients, but there were no differences between the treatment groups. Additional inductive treatment reduced the infiltration with CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, and macrophage infiltration was reduced compared with animals given CsA or FK alone. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of the donor tissue with free-radical scavengers reduces cell loss caused by tissue trauma.

40|$|Transplantation of {{embryonic}} ventral mesencephalon {{is a potential}} therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease. As only around 5 - 10 % {{of embryonic}} dopaminergic neurons survive grafting into the adult striatum, it is considered necessary to use multiple donor embryos. To increase {{the survival of the}} grafted dopaminergic neurons, the clinical transplantation program in Lund currently employs the lipid peroxidation inhibitor, <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate, in all solutions used during tissue storage, preparation, and transplantation. However, the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of donor embryos still remains an important limiting factor for the clinical application of neural transplantation. In many clinical transplantation programs, {{it would be a great}} advantage if human nigral donor tissue could be stored for at least 1 week. This study was performed in order to investigate whether storage of embryonic tissue at 4 degrees C for 8 days can be applied clinically without creating a need to increase the number of donors.

Thus, in all groups <b>tirilazad</b> mesylate was omnipresent. One group of rats was implanted with fresh tissue and three groups with hibernated tissue with or without addition of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the hibernation medium and/or the final cell suspension. Earlier studies have suggested that GDNF improves the survival of hibernated nigral transplants. We found no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding graft survival after 3 weeks. However, there was a nonsignificant trend for fewer surviving dopaminergic neurons in grafts from hibernated tissue compared to fresh controls. Furthermore, we show that the addition of GDNF to the hibernation medium and/or to the final cell suspension does not significantly increase the survival of the dopaminergic neurons...|$|E

40|$|Summary: It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{that much of the}} post-traumatic degeneration of the spinal cord following injury is caused by a multi-factorial secondary injury process that occurs during the first minutes, hours, and days after spinal cord injury (SCI). A key biochemical event in that process is reactive oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation (LP). In 1990 the results of the Second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS II) were published, which showed that the administration of a high-dose regimen of the glucocorticoid steroid methylprednisolone (MP), which had been previously shown to inhibit post-traumatic LP in animal models of SCI, could improve neurological recovery in spinal-cord-injured humans. This resulted in the registration of high-dose MP for acute SCI in several countries, although not in the U. S. Nevertheless, this treatment quickly became the standard of care for acute SCI since the drug was already on the U. S. market for many other indications. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the non-glucocorticoid 21 -aminosteroid <b>tirilazad</b> could duplicate the antioxidant neuroprotective efficacy of MP in SCI models, and evidence of human efficacy was obtained in a third NASCIS trial (NASCIS III). In recent years, the use of high-dose MP in acute SCI has become controversial largely {{on the basis of the}} risk of serious adverse effects versus what is perceived to be on average a modest neurological benefit. The opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was also tested in NASCIS II based upon the demonstration of its beneficial effects in SCI models. Although it did not a significant overall effect, some evidence of efficacy was seen in incomplete (i. e., paretic) patients. The monosialoganglioside GM 1 has also been examined in a recently completed clinical trial in which the patients first received high-dose MP treatment. However, GM 1 failed to show any evidence of a significant enhancement in the extent of neurological recovery over the level afforded by MP therapy alone. The present paper reviews the past development of MP, naloxone, <b>tirilazad,</b> and GM 1 for acute SCI, the ongoing MP-SCI controversy, identifies the regulatory complications involved in future SCI drug development, and suggests some promising neuroprotective approaches that could either replace or be used in combination with high-dose MP...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of sepsis has {{increased over the}} last few years with a high lethality of severe sepsis of 30 - 40 percent despite overall progress in medicine. Possible complications of sepsis are organ dysfunctions, that are caused by disturbances of microcirculation.

Apart from causal and supportive therapy of sepsis, adjunctive therapeutic strategies can lead to the neutralisation of these harmful mediators, such as free oxygen radicals.

The effect of a combined administration of NAC and TM on the leukocyte-endothelium interaction as a measure of leukocyte activation and the functional capillary density as a measure for intestinal microcirculation was investigated by fluorescent intravital microscopy in an experimental animal model for sepsis in rats. Also, the effect on plasma levels of the anticoagulant and proinflammatory mediator antithrombin III and the absolute leukocyte number in the peripheral blood was analysed. The sepsis was induced by a continuous sublethal administration of of 10 mg/kg BW lipopolysaccharide (LPS) i. v. After two hours of endotoxinemia the NAC/TM group showed a significant reduction of leukocytes adhering to the endothelium (p< 0. 05). Administration of NAC/TM did not lead to a statistically significant improvement of the functional capillary density in comparison to the endotoxin group with no therapy. Combined administration of NAC and TM could neither influence the lowering of endotoxin-mediated antithrombin III plasma levels nor leukopenia. Antioxidative therapy with this drug combination seems to be reasonable and effective to antagonise a pathological activation of leukocyte-endothelium interaction...|$|E
40|$|Transplantation of {{embryonic}} dopaminergic neurones can ameliorate symptoms in Parkinson’s disease, but {{a major obstacle}} for clinical transplantations to overcome is the low survival (typically 5 - 10 %) of implanted nigral neurones. If cell death in nigral grafts can be prevented, less embryonic tissue would be needed per transplantation session and hence more patients could receive intracerebral grafts as a therapy for Parkinson’s disease. Cell death in embryonic dopaminergic implants is induced by trauma during donor tissue preparation, and continues after graft implantation into the adult brain. The neuroprotective effect of different lazaroids (synthetic inhibitors of lipid peroxidation) was demonstrated in different in vitro systems, e. g. cell death induced by serum deprivation in cultures and free radical-induced neuronal death in cell suspensions. Moreover, we showed that resveratrol, which is found e. g. in red wine, can act as an antioxidant and prevent free radical-induced death in mesencephalic cells. However, {{we also found that}} in vitro models may not always be reliable when screening neuroprotective agents for transplantation. Results presented in this thesis also show that systemic treatment of graft recipients with the lazaroid <b>Tirilazad</b> Mesylate during the first 3 days after transplantation improves survival of implanted dopaminergic neurones, indicating that oxidative stress in the host brain contributes to death of the grafted neurones. In contrast, spin-trap agents did not affect graft survival in a similar paradigm. Interestingly, mild hypothermia (32 - 33 °C) of the graft recipient during transplantation and for the following 90 min improve the survival and function of nigral grafts, yielding a survival rate of approximately 50 % of the transplanted dopaminergic neurones. Findings from transplantation studies described above suggest that a substantial amount of cell death in nigral grafts occur during the immediate period after implantation. Therefore, strategies to optimise graft survival should be applied during different stages of the transplantation procedure, both before and after implantation {{of embryonic}} dopaminergic neurones...|$|E
40|$|Ischaemic stroke is {{responsible}} for substantial death and disability and creates a huge financial burden for healthcare budgets worldwide. At present there are few effective treatments for acute stroke and these are urgently required. Increased understanding of the ischaemic cascade has generated interest in neuroprotection for focal cerebral ischaemia. However, treatment effects observed in of over 500 interventions in animal models {{have yet to be}} translated to the clinic. Systematic review and meta-analysis allows unbiased identification of all relevant data for a given intervention, gives a clearer view of its true efficacy and the limitations to its therapeutic potential. Understanding the reasons for this bench-to-bedside failure and providing quantitative explanations may help to address these discrepancies. Random effects weighted mean difference meta-analysis of six interventions (<b>tirilazad,</b> tPA, NXY- 059, Hypothermia, Piracetam and IL 1 -RA) reported study quality to be consistently low. In some instances, potential sources of bias were associated with overestimations of efficacy. Likewise, clinical trials have tested interventions in conditions where efficacy was not observed in animals. Cumulative meta-analysis suggests that for tPA the estimate of efficacy is stable after the inclusion of data from 1500 animals; hypothermia and FK 506 are the only other interventions to have been tested in at least 1500 animals. Meta-regression suggests biological rather methodical factors are better predictors of outcome; a major limitation of these data is the impact of publication bias, and this work suggests effect sizes from met-analyses are inflated by about 31 % because 16 % of studies remain unpublished. The systematic review and meta-analysis of hypothermia was used to plan experiments investigating the possible impact of pethidine, a drug used to prevent shivering. This in vivo experiment, in which potential sources of bias were minimised, suggests that pethidine does not influence the observed efficacy of hypothermia in an animal model of ischaemic stroke. This thesis reports that animal studies of ischaemic stroke are often not conducted with sufficient rigour. Both minimising potential sources of bias in individual experiments and using meta-analysis to summarise data from a number of experiments may be helpful in improving the translation of neuroprotective efficacy in ischaemic stroke.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatigue after stroke {{is common}} and {{distressing}} to patients. The {{best way to}} treat this fatigue is uncertain. Theoretically, several different interventions may be of benefit. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether any treatment for fatigue after stroke reduces the proportion of patients with fatigue, or fatigue severity, or both, and {{to determine the effect}} of treatment on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death, and whether such treatments are cost effective. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), CINAHL (1982 to February 2008), AMED (1985 to February 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to February 2008), Digital Dissertations (1861 to March 2008), PsycBITE (searched March 2008), PEDro (searched March 2008), and British Nursing Index (1985 to March 2008). We also searched four trials registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included trials, and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review author who performed the searches scrutinised all titles and abstracts, excluded irrelevant references, and obtained references for potentially relevant studies. A second review author independently scrutinised potentially relevant studies to determine whether they fulfilled inclusion criteria. We included randomised controlled trials of any intervention in patients with stroke where fatigue was a primary or secondary endpoint. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The two review authors who scrutinised references independently extracted data. We performed a narrative review; we had intended to perform a meta-analysis but this was not possible as the interventions were too diverse for data to be combined. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three trials. One randomised 83 patients with emotional disturbance after stroke to fluoxetine or placebo. After correcting for differences in fatigue severity at baseline, {{there was no significant difference}} in fatigue between groups at follow up. The second trial randomised 31 women with subarachnoid haemorrhage to <b>tirilazad</b> or placebo, of whom 18 were available for follow up. There was no difference in fatigue between the two groups. The third trial investigated a chronic disease self-management programme in 1150 patients with chronic diseases, of whom 125 had had a stroke. There was no difference in fatigue at follow up between the treatment and control in the subgroup with stroke. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence available to guide the management of fatigue after stroke. Further trials are required...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Parkinson's {{disease is}} caused by {{degeneration}} of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral mesencephalon. Various animal models and clinical trials has shown that grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue can survive and functionally reinnervate the dopamine-depleted striatum, leading to long-term improvements of therapeutic value, but still symptomatic relief is far from complete. The aim of this thesis was to enhance survival of grafted fetal dopaminergic neurons and to characterise nerve growth formed by grafted and adult dopaminergic neurons regarding density and extent of nerve fiber outgrowth. One way to increase dopaminergic neuronal survival is to increase trophic support to the grafted tissue. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA was shown to be expressed in the developing striatum, thus making GDNF an interesting factor to study regarding trophic support for grafted dopaminergic neurons. The results showed that GDNF increased survival of intraocolarly grafted dopaminergic neurons. Another approach to promote survival of grafted neurons is to reduce oxidative stress during dissection and grafting {{by the use of}} a free radical scavenger or a dissection medium with high buffering capacity. Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), used at dissection, increased the survival of intraocularly grafted fetal dopamine neurons three-fold compared to Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), a cormmonly used dissection medium. The addition of the antioxidant U 74006 F (<b>tirilazad</b> mesylate, Freedox) to DMEM reulted in an additional increase in survival of grafted dopamine neurons. During development of the striatal dopaminergic innervation, the striatum first becomes innervated by dense patches of dopaminergic fibers, and later, a more widespread pattern fills up the areas between the patches. Using fetal striatal and cortical tissue as targets for host derived dopaminergic growth, it was possible study these growth patterns. The formation of different growth patterns was dependent on the implantation site. Striatal grafts placed in dorsal striatum received dense patches of dopaminergic nerve fibers, but large portions of the grafts remained uninnervated. Striatal grafts to ventral striatum or globus pallidus received the same type of dense patches of dopaminergic nerve fibers but in addition, the large uninnervated portions seen in grafts placed in dorsal striatum became partially filled with a less dense, widespread nerve fiber network. These two growth patterns resembled those seen during normal development of the striatal dopaminergic innervation, indicating that these different types of growth still could be induced in the adult animal. Fetal cortical grafts placed into dorsal striatum received a widespread dopaminergic innervation similar to that found in striatal grafts placed in globus pallidus and ventral striatum, but with the exception that no dense patches occurred. It was also shown that increased striatal dopaminotrophic activity, created by chronic haloperidol treatment, was selective for the widespread growth type while the patchy growth was unaffected. When a fetal ventrsal mesencephalic graft, placed in the lateral ventricle, reinnervated a dopamine deafferented adult striatum, solely the widespread growth pattern occurred in the striatum. However, using irntraocular double-grafts of ventral mesencephalic and striatal tissues, the age of the striatal target was shown to determine the type of growth pattern formed by the dopamine neurons. Patchy dopaminergic growth was induced in immature striatal tissue while diffuse growth dominated when the striatal tissue had been left to mature prior to implantation of the ventral mesencepha 1 ic tisssue. Furthermore, patchy growth innervated the total volume of a striatal target, while widespread growth terminated prior to complete reinnervation of the striatal target. The density of the patchy growth was also much higher than the widespread. Enhanced survival of grafted dopamine neurons after treatment with U- 74006 F did not enhance nerve fiber formation or change the growth pattern in the striatal target, but a hyperinnervation of the ventral mesencephalic graft was found. Using a retrograde tracer to mark neurons innervating adult dopamine-depleted striatum, it was shown that a subpopulation of the dopaminergic neurons dit not send their axons into the striatum, which indicates that an increase in survival of grafted neurons does not necessarily lead to an enhanced innervation of the striatal target. This thesis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} enhance survival of grafted dopaminergic neurons by using the trophic factor GDNF or the lazaroid U- 74006 F and that the extent and density of growlh into the striatal target seem to be dependent on the type of growth pattern formed by the dopaminergic graft...|$|E
