5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} {{said that it was}} probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted <b>that</b> <b>past</b> youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors {{including}} William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels {{of land in}} Oakland {{for the purpose of}} erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, but wanted to use their own East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>past</b> projects of his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930.|$|E
5|$|The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai {{is now the}} {{majority}} in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim <b>that</b> <b>past</b> elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E

5|$|The Party Play mode was {{inspired}} by recognizing <b>that</b> <b>past</b> Guitar Hero games {{made it difficult to}} jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. This aspect of the game was then brought to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in the kingdom of Ivalice, located in a {{peninsula}} surrounded by sea on the north, west and south, with a headland south of the landmass. Its geography features ranging landscapes, from plains to mountains ranges to deserts and forests. It is heavily populated by human beings, although intelligent monsters can be found living in less populated areas. Magic is predominant in the land, although ruins and artifacts indicated <b>that</b> <b>past</b> populace had relied on machinery, such as airships and robots.|$|E
5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims <b>that</b> <b>past</b> hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E

Carter sets off toward this quarry, but his yak, spooked, abandons him.|$|E

The building reflects <b>that</b> <b>past</b> in two other ways. Its interior stair tower is sided in slanted boards that recall the mineshaft towers still standing, {{and the location of}} a prominent local fault beneath the building is marked on the lobby floor.|$|E
25|$|God remains {{active in}} Israel.

25|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly what causes vaginismus, {{but it is}} thought <b>that</b> <b>past</b> sexual trauma (such as rape or abuse) may play a role.

In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex {{which seems to be}} related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. The cause is unknown.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that BPO errors (i.e. use of BPO pantomimes in place of the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in typical adult individuals) are made by patients with schizophrenia. Given that BPO errors are associated with apraxia, and <b>that</b> <b>past</b> research has indicated that schizophrenic patients have apraxia-like symptoms, this is perhaps not a surprising finding. This BPO-schizophrenia association has not been extensively explored to date, and more research is required in order to better understand it.|$|E

25|$|Charles Lyell, a noted {{geologist}} {{and founder}} of uniformitarianism, believed <b>that</b> <b>past</b> processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the British Isles. He similarly argued against mass extinctions, believing that any extinction must be a gradual process. Lyell also showed that Cuvier’s original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits, like those seen in the Paris basin, could be formed by a slow {{rise and fall of}} sea levels.|$|E
25|$|Classical Chinese poetry {{continued}} to thrive during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Ming prosperity {{was accompanied by}} a tremendous increase in population, commerce, and poetry composition. Thanks to educational opportunities made possible by commercial printing and the reinvigorated examination system, a massively larger literate population emerged. This population relied on poetry to express personal emotion and to engage with each other socially. A debate as to whether the Tang or Song poets had achieved the highest heights of excellence solidified a collective opinion <b>that</b> <b>past</b> heights could not be surpassed. With over one million surviving Ming poems, modern critics and researchers have been unable to definitively answer whether that conviction is a prejudice or a fact.|$|E
25|$|In his {{statement}} to the Senate Budget Committee, Mulvaney {{admitted that he had}} failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes from 2000-04 for a nanny he had hired to care for his triplets. Mulvaney said he did not pay the taxes because he viewed the woman as a babysitter rather than as a household employee. After filling out a questionnaire from the Trump transition team, he realized the lapse and began the process of paying back taxes and fees. Senate Democrats noted that Republicans had previously insisted <b>that</b> <b>past</b> Democratic nominees' failure to pay taxes for their household employees was disqualifying, including former Health and Human Services nominee Tom Daschle in 2009.|$|E
