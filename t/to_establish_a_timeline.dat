40|$|With the {{widespread}} permeation of continually advancing technologies into our daily lives, {{it is inevitable}} that the product of those technologies, i. e. digital information, makes its way into the courtroom. This has largely occurred in the form of electronic discovery, or “e-discovery,” where each party involved in an action provides the relevant information they possess electronically. However, in cases where information is hidden, erased, or otherwise altered, digital forensic analysis is necessary to draw further conclusions about the available evidence. Digital forensic analysis is analogous to more traditional forensic analysis. For example, in criminal cases where a firearm was used in the commission of the crime, but the gun is not readily admissible, forensic science is necessary to trace the origin of the weapon, perform fingerprint analysis on it, and compare fired bullet casings to ensure the weapon used and the weapon analyzed are one and the same. In sum, digital forensics is the preservation and analysis of electronic data. These data include the primary substantive data (the gun) and the secondary data attached to the primary data, such as data trails and time/date stamps (the fingerprints). These data trails and other metadata markers are often the key <b>to</b> <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> and correlating important events...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> distinct <b>timeline</b> in {{the development}} of the idea of Eugenics, which is the theory that a superior race of humans can be created through the manipulation of marriage, reproduction, and genetics. The most important changes in eugenic ideology occurred not in the 1900 ’s, but between 1869 and 1883, the years between which Francis Galton published his theories on Eugenics. In 1869, Eugenics was simply a theory on how human traits, such as intelligence and morality, might be hereditary; however, by 1883, the idea had already evolved into a radical philosophy, due to the influence of Darwinism, scientific racism, and Progressive Era activism. This research was conducted by analyzing the works of early Eugenicists and contemporary scholars such as Cesare Lombroso, Ernst Haeckel, and Ludwig Büchner; secondary sources analyzed the existing scientific and social environments that influenced these scholars. Significant changes occurred between 1869 and 1883, leading to a new understanding of Eugenics before it came to prominence in the 20 th Century...|$|R

Lippman had been arrested in California in conjunction with an anti-war demonstration, along with his brother, David, on April 15. [...] His co-defendants in the Seattle case were Chip Marshall, Jeff Dowd, Susan Stern, Michael Lerner, Joe Kelly, Michael Abeles,and Michael Justesen. The latter disappeared before he could be arrested. The charges stemmed from a February 1970 demonstration in Seattle, considered to be the biggest and most violent anti-war demonstration in the city at the time. It was part of a nationwide movement called [...] "The Day After," [...] meant to express solidarity and outrage at the jailing of the Chicago Seven, who organized protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Lippman, while indicted in Seattle with his other alleged co-conspirators, had moved to San Francisco the month before to edit a radical newspaper there.

50|$|The Dilmun Burial Mounds are {{a number}} of {{necropolis}} areas on the main island of Bahrain dating back to the Dilmun, the Umm an-Nar Culture and later eras. Known since ancient times as an island with {{a very large number of}} burials, the (originally) quite a number of square kilometres of mounds were said to be one of the largest cemeteries in the ancient world. The cemeteries are concentrated in the north of the island, on the hard stony areas slightly above the arable farming soils - the south of the island is mainly sandy and desert-like. Recent studies have shown that the estimated/approximately 350,000 ancient grave mounds could have been solely produced by the local population over a number of thousands of years. The graves are not all of the same era, or of exactly the same styles, and can vary considerably in size in different areas of the moundfield.

40|$|Government {{provision}} {{of a financial}} safety net for financial institutions has been {{a key element of}} the policy response to the current crisis, with governments extending existing guarantees and introducing new ones. These measures have been helpful in avoiding a further accelerated loss of confidence. But they are not costless.

Clearly, {{in the midst of a}} crisis, one should not be overly concerned with moral hazard, as the immediate task is to restore confidence, and guarantees can be helpful in that respect. Nonetheless, to keep market discipline operational, it is important to specify when the extra insurance will end, and this timeline needs to be credible. To be able <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> such <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> the root causes of the lack of confidence - that is the effects of troubled assets on financial firms' health - need to be addressed effectively. On a more fundamental level, once a government has ventured down the road of guarantee expansion, there may be a general perception that a government guarantee will always be available during crisis situations. As a consequence, other elements of the financial safety net may need to be strengthened, including the prudential and supervisory framework...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> for {{the appearance of}} different technologies and tools during human cultural evolution. Here I use stochastic character mapping of discrete traits using human mtDNA phylogenies rooted to the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS) as a model to address this question. The analysis reveals that the ancestral state of Homo sapiens was hunting, using material innovations that included bows and arrows, stone axes and spears. However, around 80, 000 y before present, a transition occurred, from this ancestral hunting tradition, toward the invention of protective weapons such as shields, the appearance of ritual fighting as a socially accepted behavior {{and the construction of}} war canoes for the fast transport of large numbers of warriors.

40|$|Biometric {{identification}} for forensic {{investigations and}} security continues {{to depend on}} classic fingerprinting in many instances. Existing techniques rely on either visible deposits or hidden (latent) fingerprints resulting from the transfer of residues from the finger to the surface. However, one {{of the limitations of}} classic fingerprinting, for use as forensic evidence, is in determining a time sequence of events. It is extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>timeline,</b> from fingerprint evidence alone. We present the capability of a new technique which images the electrical charge deposited by tribocharging when a finger contacts an electrically insulated surface. The method is applicable to insulating surfaces and has been tested on PVC, PTFE, Acetate and PVDF sheets. The latent electrostatic charge pattern is detected using a novel, microscopic, electric potential sensor. The sensor is capable of imaging static charge distributions non-invasively, with no discharging effect on the sample. We present data showing the decay of the charge image with time, over a period up to 14 days. This capability has two major implications.

However, regulatory variation that arises through new promoter and transcription factor combinations or epigenetic events may {{also contribute to the}} effects of polyploidization. In this study, gene expression was characterized in a synthetic T. aestivum line and the T. turgidum and Aegilops tauschii parents <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> for such regulatory changes and estimate the frequency of nonadditive expression of homoeologous transcripts in newly formed T. aestivum. Large-scale analysis of nonadditive gene expression was assayed by microarray expression experiments, where synthetic T. aestivum gene expression was compared to additive model values (mid-parent) calculated from parental T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii expression levels. Approximately 16 % of genes were estimated to display nonadditive expression in synthetic T. aestivum. A certain fraction of the genes (2. 9 %) showed overdominance or underdominance. cDNA–single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was applied to measure expression of homoeologous transcripts and further verify microarray data.

The objectives of this study were <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> of the innate immune response in the uterus of healthy horses and to investigate the oestrous cycle effect on this. Endometrial biopsies were collected from five horses before and at 3, 12, 24, 48 and 72  h after inoculation of Escherichia coli, once in oestrus and once in dioestrus. They were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR, microbiology and histology. Neutrophil numbers increased from very low levels in the absence of inflammation to severe neutrophilia 3  h after inoculation. The concentrations of mRNAs for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR 4, NOD-like receptor NLRC 5, tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidases 1 (TIMP 1) and chemokines CCL 2, CXCL 9, CXCL 10 and CXCL 11 were all increased 3  h after inoculation of E. coli compared to levels detected prior to inoculation. Chemokine mRNA levels remained elevated for 48  h. Concentrations of mRNAs for the antimicrobial peptides equine β-defensin 1 (EBD 1), lysozyme, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), lipocalin 2 (LCN 2), lactoferrin and uteroferrin were increased between 3 and 12  h post inoculation. The gene for secreted phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2) was expressed constitutively. P 19 uterocalin mRNA levels were higher in dioestrus than in oestrus over the first 24  h of inflammation. Neutrophils and many innate immune genes responded rapidly to the introduction of E. coli into the uterus, while the oestrous cycle stage had only a relatively minor effect on the response to E. coli.
