Triggers of eryptosis include oxidative stress which may activate erythrocytic Ca 2 + permeable unselective cation channels with subsequent Ca 2 + entry and increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i). The present study explored whether and how <b>Triparanol</b> induces eryptosis. To this end, phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface was estimated from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, hemolysis from hemoglobin release, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, and ROS formation from 2 ’, 7 ’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) dependent fluorescence.

Analysis by t. l. c. of 14 C-labelled non-saponifiable lipids formed from either [14 C]acetate or [14 C]mevalonate during the cell incubations confirmed the sites of action of the drugs used. Beside the 14 C-labelled substrates of the blocked enzymes and 14 C-labelled cholesterol, another non-saponifiable lipid fraction was observed, which behaves as polar sterols on t. l. c.

Very similar results were obtained when cholesterol synthesis was assayed in vivo with acetate- 14 C as a cholesterol precursor.

Molecular cloning of the cDNA revealed that the human enzyme is a membrane-bound protein with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa and six to nine putative transmembrane segments.

40|$|Human {{disorders}} {{caused by}} inborn errors of cholesterol biosynthesis {{are characterized by}} dysmorphogenesis of multiple organs. This includes limb malformations that are observed at high frequency in some disorders, such as the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, indicating a pivotal role of cholesterol in limb morphogenesis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cholesterol can modulate {{the activity of the}} Hedgehog proteins, that act as morphogens to regulate the precise patterning of many embryonic structures, among which the developing limbs. To provide insight in the functions of cholesterol during limb development and in the potential role of Hedgehog signaling in the genesis of limb defects, we developed an in vivo rat model of cholesterol deficiency. We show here that treatment with <b>Triparanol,</b> a distal inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, induced patterning defects of the autopod at high frequency, including pre-axial syndactyly and post-axial polydactyly, thus reproducing limb anomalies frequently observed in humans. Using in situ hybridization, we show that these malformations originate from a modification of Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the limb bud at 13 days post-coitum, leading to a deficiency of the anterior part of the limb. This deficiency results in an imbalance of Indian Hedgehog expression in the forming cartilage, ultimately leading to reduced interdigital apoptosis and syndactyly. Our study thus unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of limb defects associated with cholesterol deficiency in rodents, and most probably in humans...|$|E
40|$|The sigma-drug {{binding site}} of {{guinea-pig}} liver is carried by a protein which shares significant {{amino acid sequence}} similarities with the yeast sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase (ERG 2 protein). Pharmacologically - but not structurally - the sigma 1 -site is also related to the emopamil binding protein, the mammalian sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase. We therefore investigated if sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase inhibitors are high affinity ligands for the (+) -[3 H]-pentazocine labelled sigma 1 -binding site. Among the compounds which bound with high affinity to native hepatic and cerebral {{as well as to}} yeast expressed sigma 1 -binding sites were the agricultural fungicide fenpropimorph (Ki 0. 005 [*]nM), the antihypocholesterinaemic drugs <b>triparanol</b> (Ki 7. 0 [*]nM), AY- 9944 (Ki 0. 46 [*]nM) and MDL 28, 815 (Ki 0. 16 [*]nM), the enantiomers of the ovulation inducer clomiphene (Ki 5. 5 and 12 [*]nM, respectively) and the antioestrogene tamoxifen (Ki 26 [*]nM). Except for tamoxifen these affinities are essentially identical with those for the [3 H]-ifenprodil labelled sterol C 8 –C 7 isomerase of S. cerevisiae. This demonstrates that sigma 1 -binding protein and yeast isomerase are not only structurally but also pharmacologically related. Because of its affiliations with yeast and mammalian sterol isomerases we propose that the sigma 1 -binding site is localized on a sterol isomerase related protein, involved in postsqualene sterol biosynthesis...|$|E
