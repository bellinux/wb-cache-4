5|$|As a freshman, VanVleet contributed {{double digit}} scoring twice (versus Gonzaga and Ohio State) in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament from {{off the bench}} as the 2012–13 Shockers team reached the final four. Against Gonzaga, his 13 points {{included}} basket with 1:28 remaining <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> Shockers secure only the fifth sweet sixteen appearance by a number 9 seed since the tournament went to 64 teams in 1985. His 12 points against Ohio State included a late basket <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> Shockers become the fifth team with a seeding higher than eight {{to make it to}} the final four since 1979 when seeding began.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{collection}} of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading {{to the destruction of}} many manuscripts.

5|$|The {{other major}} factor <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks {{spent much time}} on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed much longer than their opposition.|$|E

Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E

5|$|The tour began {{well for}} the Australians with an innings victory in their opening match at Uckfield against a team chosen by Lord Sheffield which {{included}} W. G. Grace, George Ulyett, Billy Barnes, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. Although Fred Spofforth, Harry Boyle and Billy Midwinter were all playing, the Australian bowling was performed by George Giffen and Joey Palmer only, and they both took ten wickets in the match. However, the key performance in conditions <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> bowling was Alick Bannerman's innings of 94 which alone outscored the Sheffield XI's first innings total of 86.|$|E
5|$|In the offseason, Houston saw {{major changes}} in the roster as the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady in a seven-player deal with the Orlando Magic. The scoring champion McGrady and the strong rebounder Yao formed a well-regarded pair <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> Rockets win 22 consecutive games in the 2007–08 NBA season, which was at the time the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. Still, the duo was plagued with injuries – of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 – and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the Dallas Mavericks in 2005 and the Jazz in 2007. After the 2007 elimination, Van Gundy was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.|$|E
5|$|Meksi was {{a member}} of the Filiki Etaireia, a secret society whose purpose was to {{overthrow}} Ottoman rule over the Balkans and to establish an independent Greek state. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, after his translation had been completed, Meksi joined the Greeks in the Siege of Tripolitsa. Despite suffering from a serious bout of pneumonia, he continued to work as a physician during the war. He is also said to have taken part in the negotiations leading to an agreement proposed by Theodoros Kolokotronis that permitted the Albanians who were defending Tripolitsa to leave unharmed, an arrangement <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> Greeks to capture the town from the Turks.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in better results. A run out was {{narrowly}} avoided from the first ball, and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>the</b> bowlers. Both fell early, leaving England 28/2. Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves. Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer, but edged it into his face. This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting, resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added. They reached lunch at 57/2. Upon the resumption, Crapp accelerated, hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson. Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37. Dollery then fell for one. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich fell to Lindwall. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his wound having been stitched. Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141/6, bringing Evans to the crease. Compton and Evans added 75 runs, before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216/7.|$|E
