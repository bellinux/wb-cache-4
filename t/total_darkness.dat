5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in <b>total</b> <b>darkness,</b> turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in <b>total</b> <b>darkness,</b> loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started.

Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in <b>total</b> <b>darkness</b> if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost <b>total</b> <b>darkness.</b> As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight.

5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in <b>total</b> <b>darkness.</b> Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into <b>total</b> <b>darkness,</b> where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in <b>total</b> <b>darkness,</b> and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in <b>total</b> <b>darkness,</b> the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The time-course of the light-induced {{changes in}} {{membrane}} voltage and resistance were measured for single photoreceptors in the retina of Gekko gekko. In the surgically isolated retina, small stimuli {{directed toward the}} impaled receptor produced a membrane hyperpolarization the time-course of which was identical {{to that of the}} increase in membrane resistance. In the eyecup preparation nearly identical time-courses were evoked only after perfusion of the vitreous surface with solution having high (Mg++). Disparate time-courses were obtained in (a) the isolated retina when large or displaced stimuli were used, and (b) the eyecup preparation when it was treated normally (see Pinto and Pak. 1974. J. Gen. Physiol. 64 : 49) and when it was exposed to aspartate ions or hypoxia. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the receptor potential (elicited in the impaled receptor as a result of quanta only it captures) is generated by a single ionic process that decreases membrane conductance. These measurements provide a means to distinguish the receptor potential from interactions. From direct measurements of membrane time constant and <b>total</b> resistance in <b>darkness,</b> <b>total</b> membrane capacitance was calculated. The mean capacitance was 7. 1 X 10 - 5 F. This high value is consistent with anatomical observations of membrane infoldings at the base of gecko photoreceptors...|$|R

50|$|Cradle of Filth {{was formed}} in Suffolk, England in 1991. The band's {{original}} members consisted of vocalist Dani Filth, guitarist Paul Ryan, keyboardist Ben Ryan (Paul's brother), bassist John Pritchard and drummer Darren Gardner. With this line-up, Cradle of Filth recorded a demo in 1992, titled Invoking the Unclean.

Robin left the band shortly afterwards, but following the departure of John Pritchard, Eaglestone returned {{to take his place}} as bassist. Guitarist Paul Allender joined the band at the same time. Following these changes, another demo was recorded, titled <b>Total</b> Fucking <b>Darkness</b> (released commercially in 2014, bolstered with rehearsal sessions and a surviving track from the abandoned Goetia album). Sarginson left the band soon after, paving the way for the entry of drummer Nicholas Barker.|$|R

An album entitled Goetia was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone {{went out of business}} and could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, was Cacophonous's first release in 1994.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first nightside EUV and FUV airglow limb spectra of Titan showing {{molecular}} emissions. The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed photon emissions of Titan's {{day and night}} limb-airglow and disk-airglow on multiple occasions, including during an eclipse observation. The 71 airglow observations analyzed in this paper show EUV (600 - 1150 Å) and FUV (1150 - 1900 Å) atomic multiplet lines and band emissions arising from either photoelectron induced fluorescence and solar photo-fragmentation of molecular nitrogen (N[SUB] 2 [/SUB]) or excitation by magnetosphere plasma. The altitude of the peak UV emissions on the limb during daylight occurred inside the thermosphere at the altitude of the topside ionosphere (near 1000 km altitude). However, at night on the limb, a subset of emission features, much weaker in intensity, arise in the atmosphere with two different geometries. First, there is a twilight photoelectron-excited glow that persists with solar depression angle up to 25 - 30 degrees past the terminator, until the solar XUV shadow height passes the altitude of the topside ionosphere (1000 - 1200 km). The UV twilight glow spectrum {{is similar to the}} dayglow but weaker in intensity. Second, beyond 120 ° solar zenith angle, when the upper atmosphere of Titan is in <b>total</b> XUV <b>darkness,</b> there is indication of weak and sporadic nightside UV airglow emissions excited by magnetosphere plasma collisions with ambient thermosphere gas, with similar N[SUB] 2 [/SUB] excited features as above in the daylight or twilight glow over an extended altitude range.

40|$|Fresh-cut leafy {{vegetables}} have been gaining {{importance in the}} human diet both for their nutraceutical proprieties and low calories content. The preparation procedures for fresh-cut production and the storage system may lead to severe leaf damages that may affect leaf colour and induce shortened shelf life. The aim of this work was to study the leaf pigment changes in cut and whole Swiss chard leaves under dark or light storage conditions. The effect of treatments was evaluated by chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin determinations. The leaf membrane integrity was estimated by electrolyte leakage. All measurements were performed until 12 days of storage. The chlorophyll reduction was statistically significant in cut Swiss chard leaves stored in <b>darkness.</b> <b>Total</b> carotenoids did not significantly decline. Anthocyanin content strongly declined in cut leaves in both dark and light storage conditions. Leaf electrolyte leakage increased after 8 days of storage and higher leakage was observed in Swiss chard stored in light conditions without any difference between cut or whole leaves. Results suggest that Swiss chard can be stored until 8 days without any visible changes. Dark storage seemed to preserve quality losses and reduce membrane permeability.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: In blind cave-dwelling {{populations of}} Astyanax mexicanus, several {{morphological}} and behavioral shifts occurred during evolution in caves characterized by <b>total</b> and permanent <b>darkness.</b> Previous {{studies have shown}} that sensory systems such as the lateral line (mechanosensory) and taste buds (chemosensory) are modified in cavefish. It has long been hypothesized that another chemosensory modality, the olfactory system, might have evolved as well to provide an additional mechanism for food-searching in troglomorphic Astyanax populations. FINDINGS: During a March 2013 cave expedition to the Sierra de El Abra region of San Luís Potosi, Mexico, we tested chemosensory capabilities of the Astyanax mexicanus of the Rio Subterráneo cave. This cave hosts a hybrid population presenting a wide range of troglomorphic and epigean mixed phenotypes. During a behavioral test performed in situ in the cave, a striking correlation was observed between the absence of eyes and an increased attraction to food extract. In addition, eyeless troglomorphic fish possessed significantly larger naris size than their eyed, nontroglomorphic counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that chemosensory capabilities might have evolved in cave-dwelling Astyanax mexicanus and that modulation of naris size might at least partially underlie this likely adaptive change...|$|R

Total luminescence and synchronous scanning fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were tested with the purpose to check their ability to monitor changes occurring in olive oil during storage in different conditions: in clear and green glass bottles exposed to light, and in <b>darkness.</b> <b>Total</b> luminescence spectra of the initial oil samples in n-hexane solutions exhibited intense peaks, one with a maximum appearing at 320 nm in emission and 290 nm in excitation, attributed to tocopherols, and another appearing at 670 nm in emission and 405 nm in excitation, belonging to the pigments of the chlorophyll group. The intensity of these emissions decreased during storage depending on the storage conditions. Additional bands appeared in oils exposed to light in the intermediate range of excitation and emission wavelengths, arising from unidentified compounds. Bands attributed to tocopherols, chlorophylls and those tentatively ascribed to phenolic compounds were observed in the synchronous scanning fluorescence spectra, allowing monitoring of the storage effects on these constituents and their quantitative assessment after appropriate calibration.
