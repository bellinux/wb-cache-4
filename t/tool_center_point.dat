40|$|The {{determination}} of collision free grips {{is an important}} aspect of random bin picking, which describes the separation of unordered workpieces stored in bins by an industrial robot. Heuristic search algorithms are an appropriate approach to this problem. In this paper, we analyze the influence of relative height and lateral position of workpieces as well as orientation of <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>points</b> on finding valid grips. From these results, we deduce heuristic functions, which can be used to improve the aforementioned heuristic search algorithms.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} robot applications require fewer task constraints than the robot’s degrees of freedom. For welding robots, for example, rotations of the welding torch around its axis do not negatively impact welding quality. Furthermore, the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point’s</b> Cartesian position and desired orientation {{as a function}} of time is often determined by the (manufacturing) process. Nevertheless, programming these robots can be time consuming. Reducing or eliminating this programming cost will allow robots to be used for producing small series. Recently, a promising software package for Cartesian path planning with the name Descartes was released by the ROS-Industrial community. To the authors’ knowledge, an in-depth description of this algorithm and an experimental evaluation is lacking in literature. This paper describes the path planning approach used by the Descartes package. Moreover, the software’s performance is evaluated for several robot welding tasks and the encountered limitations are discussed. In addition, we showed that the planner’s performance can be improved by changing the cost function that the planner’s graph search algorithm minimises. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Today, <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> {{calibration}} {{is mostly}} {{done by a}} manual procedure. The method is very time consuming and the result may vary due to how skilled the operators are. This thesis proposes a new automated iterative method for <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> calibration of industrial robots, by making use of computer vision and image processing techniques. The new method has several advantages over the manual calibration method. Experimental verifications {{have shown that the}} proposed method is much faster, still delivering a comparable or even better accuracy. The setup of the proposed method is very easy, only one USB camera connected to a laptop computer is needed and no contact with the robot tool is necessary during the calibration procedure. The method can be split into three different parts. Initially, the transformation between the robot wrist and the tool is determined by solving a closed loop of homogeneous transformations. Second an image segmentation procedure is described for finding point correspondences on a rotation symmetric robot tool. The image segmentation part is necessary for performing a measurement with six degrees of freedom of the camera to tool transformation. The last part of the proposed method is an iterative procedure which automates an ordinary four point <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> calibration algorithm. The iterative procedure ensures that the accuracy of the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> calibration only depends on the accuracy of the camera when registering a movement between two positions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> {{calibration}} is a known {{problem in}} industrial robotics. The {{major focus of}} academic research is to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of next generation robots. However, operators of currently available robots are working {{within the limits of}} the robot´s repeatability and require calibration methods suitable for these basic applications. This study was conducted in association with Stresstech Oy, which provides solutions for manufacturing quality control. Their sensor, based on the Barkhausen noise effect, requires accurate positioning. The accuracy requirement admits a <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> calibration problem if measurements are executed with an industrial robot. Multiple possibilities are available in the market for automatic <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> calibration. Manufacturers provide customized calibrators to most robot types and tools. With the handmade sensors and multiple robot types that Stresstech uses, this would require great deal of labor. This thesis introduces a calibration method that is suitable for all robots which have two digital input ports free. It functions with the traditional method of using a light barrier to detect the tool in the robot coordinate system. However, this method utilizes two parallel light barriers to simultaneously measure and detect the center axis of the tool. Rotations about two axes are defined with the center axis. The last rotation about the Z-axis is calculated for tools that have different width of X- and Y-axes. The results indicate that this method is suitable for calibrating the geometric <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> of a Barkhausen noise sensor. In the repeatability tests, a standard deviation inside robot repeatability was acquired. The Barkhausen noise signal was also evaluated after recalibration and the results indicate correct calibration. However, future studies should be conducted using a more accurate manipulator, since the method employs the robot itself as a measuring device...|$|E

It is unknown whether the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> on the glenoid surface corresponds {{to the center of}} the glenoid vault at the medial extent of the glenoid prosthesis. We reviewed 20 consecutive computed tomography scans obtained preoperatively in patients with primary osteoarthritis. A glenoid <b>center</b> <b>point</b> was chosen on the glenoid surface and then projected back into the glenoid vault along the scapular axis and perpendicular to glenoid inclination. The difference from the projection of the glenoid surface <b>center</b> <b>point</b> to the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> at a 1. 5 -cm depth into the glenoid vault was then measured. The mean deviation of the glenoid <b>center</b> <b>point</b> at a depth of 1. 5  cm from the <b>center</b> <b>point</b> at the glenoid articular surface was 1. 7  mm anterior and 3. 9  mm inferior.

30|$|If {{the posture}} axis offset is large, when {{changing}} the posture {{of the end}} effector in a fixed state of a <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point,</b> {{the motion of the}} three basic axes for the positioning of the end effector increases. Therefore, the effective working area of the robot including the posture of the end effector cannot be secured effectively. In particular, {{in the case of a}} laparoscopic assist robot, since the three basic axes must be operated under the trocar restriction, large motion of a forceps shaft is needed to change the posture of the end effector in a fixed state of a <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point.</b> Therefore, the influence of the offset is more serious, and to secure a sufficient working area, the three basic axes need to be enlarged. Also, the offset would render the wrist mechanism too large for laparoscopic applications.|$|E

The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>point</b> position as recorded with an in-house non-contact measuring instrument to evaluate the total geometric errors. A method is proposed to decompose the geometric errors in two categories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed rate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the acceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions of contouring error, quasi-static geometric error and dynamic geometric error is evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and dynamic error is highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Chatter is a {{major problem}} causing poor surface finish, low {{material}} removal rate, machine tool failure, increased tool wear, excessive noise and thus increased cost for machining applications. Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately. During cutting operations, due to gyroscopic moments, centrifugal forces and thermal expansions bearing dynamics change resulting in tool point FRF variations. In addition, gyroscopic moments on spindle-holder-tool assembly cause separation of modes in tool point FRF into backward and forward modes which will lead to variations in tool point FRF. Therefore, for accurate stability predictions of machining operations, effects of operational conditions on machine tool dynamics should be considered in calculations. In this study, spindle bearing dynamics are identified for various spindle rotational speeds and cutting forces. Then, for a real machining <b>center,</b> <b>tool</b> <b>point</b> FRFs under operating conditions are determined using the identified speed dependent bearing dynamics and the mathematical model proposed. Moreover, effects of gyroscopic moments and bearing dynamics variations on tool point FRF are examined separately.
