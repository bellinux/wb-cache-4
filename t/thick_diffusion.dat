40|$|We first motivate {{a general}} submesh {{sweeping}} technique that avoids the complications associated with sweeping on meshes with reentrant cells. The scattering sources are constructed on a primary mesh, but sweeps are performed on a submesh that underlies the primary mesh. A critical {{aspect of this}} approach is the projection of the submesh sweep solution onto the primary mesh for purposes of calculating the scattering sources. We define this projection for standard discontinuous finite-element (DFEM) methods and lumped DFEM methods, and discuss our reasons for making this definition. We give computational results for linear-discontinuous and lumped linear-discontinuous discretizations on a 1 -D primary mesh and submesh that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of accuracy and preservation of the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit for a simple but highly relevant case.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit of various spatial discretizations of the one-dimensional, steady-state, monoenergetic, discrete ordinates neutron transport equation. This work specifically addresses the two lowest order nodal methods, AHOT-N 0 and AHOT-N 1, as well as reconsiders the asymptotic limit of the Diamond Difference method. The asymptotic analyses of the AHOT-N 0 and AHOT-N 1 nodal methods show that AHOT-N 0 does not possess the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit for cell edge or cell average fluxes except under very limiting conditions, {{which is to be}} expected considering the AHOT-N 0 method limits to the Step method in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit. The AHOT-N 1 method, which uses a linear in-cell representation of the flux, was shown to possess the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit for both cell average and cell edge fluxes. The <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit of the DD method, including the boundary conditions, was derived entirely in terms of cell average scalar fluxes. It was shown that, for vacuum boundaries, only when {sigma}{sub t}, h, and Q are constant and {sigma}{sub a} = 0 is the asymptotic limit of the DD method close to the finite-differenced diffusion equation in the system interior, and that the boundary conditions between the systems will only agree {{in the absence of an}} external source. For a homogeneous medium an effective diffusion coefficient was shown to be present, which was responsible for causing numeric diffusion in certain cases. A technique was presented to correct the numeric diffusion in the interior by altering certain problem parameters. Numerical errors introduced by the boundary conditions and material interfaces were also explored for a two-region problem using the Diamond Difference method. A discrete diffusion solution which exactly solves the one-dimensional diffusion equation in a homogeneous region with constant cross sections and a uniform external source was also developed and shown to be equal to the finite-differenced diffusion discretization for c = 1 in the system interior, where again the boundary conditions again only agree in the absence of an external source. It was also shown that for c < 1 the exact discrete diffusion solution is written in terms of hyperbolic functions, with expressions which limit to the exact solution for the c = 1 case as c {yields} 1. Finally, a transport discretization is developed which reproduces the exact S 2 solution for the case of a purely scattering homogeneous region with vacuum boundary conditions, and an extension to the discretization for the case of c < 1 is found by considering a Taylor series expansion of the exact answer centered at c = 0...|$|E

We implement our new method, {{as well as the}} lineardiscontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method and the lumped linear-discontinuous Galerkin (LLDG) method. The implementation is in FORTRAN. We run a series of numerical tests to study the robustness, L 2 accuracy, and the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit performance of the new LDLS method. By robustness we mean the resistance to negativities and rapid damping of oscillations. Computational results indicate that the LDLS method yields a uniform second-order error. It is more robust than the LDG method and more accurate than the LLDG method. However, it fails to preserve the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit. Consequently, it is viable for neutronics but not for radiative transfer since radiative transfer problems can be highly diffusive...|$|E

30|$|Over {{the whole}} {{concentration}} range for electrolytes under study, {{the zeta potential}} values indicate a negative charge on the particles at pH above 6. As for zeta potential evolution in a strongly acidic pH, in alkaline medium, the magnitudes of zeta potential at electrolyte concentration for 0.1 and 0.001  M are close. The increase in the electrolyte concentration from 0.001 to 0.01  M increases the zeta potential electronegativity. So, increasing the concentration of ions with maximum hydration shell, but forming the <b>thickest</b> <b>diffusion</b> layer among the studied solutions, {{does not lead to}} a significant reduction in zeta potential and aggregation of the system, as seen in [3]. The positively charged metal ion neutralizes the surface charge on the surfaces of MWCNTs and compresses the double layer, resulting in the reduction of electrostatic repulsion between nanotubes. Thus, the zeta potential depends on the concentration of the electrolyte solution while the surface charge is determined by the specific adsorption properties of the ions. This may explain the different effects of ions of the same valence and stability of coagulation of colloidal solutions.|$|R

The carburising process resulted in a multilayer structure comprising a titanium carbide (TiC) network layer atop of a relatively <b>thick</b> α-titanium oxygen <b>diffusion</b> zone (α-Ti(O)). Initial tribological tests demonstrated that the new surface treatment can significantly enhance the tribological properties of titanium, in terms of much reduced friction, improved wear resistance and enhanced load bearing capacity. The TiC surface structure offers enhanced hardness (2100 HV) and low friction coefficient (µ ≈ 0. 2) when in dry sliding contact with an alumina (Al 2 O 3) ball, while the <b>thick</b> oxygen <b>diffusion</b> zone offers much enhanced load bearing capacity.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we discuss}} the development, implementation, analysis and testing of the Piecewise Linear Discontinuous Finite Element Method (PWLD) applied to the particle transport equation in two-dimensional cylindrical (RZ) and three-dimensional Cartesian (XYZ) geometries. We have designed this method to be applicable to radiative-transfer problems in radiation-hydrodynamics systems for arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral meshes. For RZ geometry, we have implemented this method in the Capsaicin radiative-transfer code being developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In XYZ geometry, we have implemented the method in the Parallel Deterministic Transport code being developed at Texas A&M University. We discuss {{the importance of the}} <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit for radiative-transfer problems, and perform a thick diffusion-limit analysis on our discretized system for both geometries. This analysis predicts that the PWLD method will perform well in this limit for many problems of physical interest with arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral cells. Finally, we run a series of test problems to determine some useful properties of the method and verify the results of our <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit analysis. Finally, we test our method on a variety of test problems and show that it compares favorably to existing methods. With these test problems, we also show that our method performs well in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit as predicted by our analysis. Based on PWLD's solid finite-element foundation, the desirable properties it shows under analysis, and the excellent performance it demonstrates on test problems even with highly distorted spatial grids, we conclude that it is an excellent candidate for radiativetransfer problems that need a robust method that performs well in thick diffusive problems or on distorted grids...|$|E
40|$|Standard second-order self-adjoint {{forms of}} the {{transport}} equation, such as the even-parity, odd-parity, and self-adjoint angular flux equation, cannot be used in voids. Perhaps more importantly, they experience numerical convergence difficulties in near-voids. Here we present {{a new form of}} a second-order self-adjoint transport equation that has an advantage relative to standard forms in that it can be used in voids or near-voids. Our equation is closely related to the standard least-squares or normal form of the transport equation, which is applicable in a void and has a non-conservative analytic form. However, unlike the standard least-squares form of the transport equation, our least-squares equation is compatible with source iteration. It has been found that the standard least-squares form of the transport equation with a linear-continuous finite-element spatial discretization has difficulty in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit. Here we extensively test the 1 -D slab-geometry version of our scheme with respect to void solutions, spatial convergence rate, and the intermediate and <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limits.

The blade morphology of Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh varies with the hydrodynamic environment in which it grows; wave-exposed blades are narrow and thick with small surface corrugations (1 mm tall), whereas wave-sheltered blades are wider and thinner with large (2 – 5 cm) edge undulations. Within the surface corrugations of wave-exposed blades, the DBL thickness, measured using an O₂ micro-optode, ranged from 0. 67 to 0. 80 mm and did not vary with mainstream velocities between 0. 8 and 4. 5 cm • s⁻¹. At the corrugation apex, DBL thickness decreased with increasing seawater velocity, from 0. 4 mm at 0. 8 cm • s⁻¹ to being undetectable at 4. 5 cm • s⁻¹. Results show how the wave-exposed blades trap fluid within the corrugations at their surface. For wave-sheltered blades at 0. 8 cm • s⁻¹, a DBL thickness of 0. 73 ± 0. 31 mm within the edge undulation was 10 -fold greater than at the undulation apex, while at 2. 1 cm • s⁻¹, DBL thicknesses were similar at < 0. 07 mm. Relative turbulence intensity was measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV), and overall, there was little evidence to support our hypothesis that the edge undulations of wave-sheltered blades increased turbulence intensity compared to wave-exposed blades.

40|$|The {{emerging}} technique of DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films) {{is shown to}} be capable of performing new speciation measurements in situ in natural waters. In DGT, metals are bound to a resin layer after passing through a well-defined diffusion layer. Cd was measured in solutions containing glycine, EDTA, and fulvic (FA) and humic acids (HA) by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV), and DGT. DGT measured similar labile fractions to ASV, with detailed differences being consistent with a <b>thicker</b> <b>diffusion</b> layer allowing more dissociation of labile complexes and a slower diffusion of FA and HA complexes through the gel. When single measurements are made in complex solutions with DGT, precise quantification is impossible due to uncertainties concerning the distribution of species with different diffusion coefficients. A new procedure was proposed based on the advantage of DGT of being able to control the pore size of the diffusive gel layer. Small (inorganic) species diffuse freely through all gels but larger FA and HA (organic) complexes diffuse less freely in more constrained gels. When measurements were made on known solutions of Cu and FA or HA, it was possible to quantify the inorganic and organic species separately. They agreed well with predictions made using the WHAM speciation code. Multiple DGT units were also deployed in situ in a stream with high dissolved organic carbon (14. 6 mg/L). The systematic differences between the devices with different gel compositions enabled determination, for the first time, of the in situ concentrations of both labile inorganic and organic species in natural water. A single DGT device with a constrained gel can be used to quantify inorganic species directly, providing absolute accuracy is not required. This ability of DGT to measure well-defined fractions of metals in situ using a simple device gives it considerable potential as a regulatory tool. A direct speciation measurement may be preferable to modeling approaches which require diverse input data that are difficult to determine...|$|R

Finally, we note that the properties of the PWBL basis functions are such that the leading-order piecewise bi-linear discontinuous finite element (PWBLD) solution will satisfy a reasonably accurate diffusion discretization in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit, making the PWBLD method a viable candidate for many different classes of transport problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{characteristics}} (MOC) is a deterministic transport method that {{has been applied to}} large-scale problems including those in reactor physics and radiative transfer. Long characteristics, (LC) methods, have been used extensively to discretize and solve transport problems in the spatial domain. There is a need for an equally adequate time-dependent discretization for these transport problems. The new contributions from this research include the development of a space-time long characteristic (STLC) method with various source approximations including several that employ a piece-wise linear (PWL) approximation spatially. In the prism-PWL (PPWL) method the coefficient of each PWL spatial function is linear in time in each space-time cell. Along with STLC, a PWL-LC method is developed for steady-state problems in (x, y) and (x, y, z). The methods developed in this work use least-squares projections to determine the coefficients of their source approximations. This work presents a detailed asymptotic analysis of the PWL-LC and STLC methods in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit, which is of special interest in radiative transfer problems. This is the first such analysis reported for LC methods and these new methods are the first that are expected to perform well in this limit. Results from test problems executed with {{a modified version of the}} Parallel Deterministic Transport code, PDT, show the PWL-LC and STLC methods are more accurate than current methods for streaming problems. From asymptotic analysis and test problems, it is found that the steady-state PWL-LC method is accurate in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit with solutions similar to those of analogous discontinuous finite element method, DFEM, solutions. Similarly, the PPWL-STLC method is found to be accurate in time-dependent thick diffusive problems. STLC is also a promising method for massively parallel applications because it permits the use of track-based sweeping, which appears to have significant advantages over cell-based sweeping. This is a key topic recommended for further research...|$|E

40|$|The linear {{discontinuous}} {{finite element}} method (LDFEM) is the current work horse of the radiation transport community. The popularity of LDFEM {{is a result of}} LDFEM (and its Q 1 multi-dimensional extensions) being both accurate and preserving the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit. In practice, the LDFEM equations must be ?lumped? to mitigate negative radiation transport solutions. Negative solutions are non-physical, but are inherent to the mathematics of LDFEM and other spatial discretizations. Ongoing changes in high performance computing (HPC) are dictating a preference for increased numbers of floating point operations (FLOPS) per unknown. Higher order discontinuous {{finite element method}}s (DFEM), those with polynomial trial spaces greater than linear, have been found to offer more accuracy per unknown than LDFEM. However, DFEM with higher degree trial spaces have received only limited attention due to their increased computational time per unknown, LDFEM's preservation of the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit, and the relative accuracy of LDFEM compared to other historical spatial discretizations. As solution methods evolve to make the most efficient use of HPC, {{it is possible that the}} increased computational work of higher order DFEM may become a strength rather than a hindrance. For higher order DFEM to be useful in practice, lumping techniques must be developed to inhibit negative radiation transport solutions. We will show that traditional mass matrix lumping does not guarantee positive solutions and limits the overall accuracy of the DFEM scheme. To solve this problem, we propose a new, quadrature based, self-lumping technique. Our self-lumping technique does not limit solution order of convergence, improves solution positivity, and can be easily adapted to account for the within cell variation of interaction cross section. To test and demonstrate the characteristics of our self-lumping methodology, we apply our schemes to several test problems: a homogeneous, source-free pure absorber; a pure absorber with spatially varying cross section; a model fuel depletion problem; and finally, we solve the grey thermal radiative transfer equations...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Characteristic {{methods are}} widely {{known to be}} very {{accurate}} approaches to the solution of numerical transport problems. These methods are most often used for neutron transport applications (i. e. lattice physics calculations) where spatial cells are of intermediate optical thickness (O(1) - O(100) mean free paths, depending on the energy group) and materials are not exceptionally highly scattering (scattering ratios < 0. 999). There has been interest in using characteristic methods for radiative transfer applications, which often involve very optically thick and diffusive regions. Previous work has involved analyses of families of Cartesian geometry characteristic methods in optically thick and diffusive regions. There is a significant body {{of work in the}} Russian literature on curvilinear geometry characteristic methods, but very few analyses of their behavior in thick diffusive regions have been published. This thesis will focus on the diffusion limit of a specific family of 1 -D spherical geometry characteristic methods - the method of tubes (MOT). In these methods, the streaming operator is transformed via a change of coordinates into a slab-geometry-like form. First we present two MOT discretizations published in the Russian literature and two new variants (SC, LC) based on traditional slab geometry characteristic approaches. We have performed asymptotic analyses of these four characteristic methods and have verified these analyses with numerical results. Optically thick and diffusive problems are often very computationally expensive to solve using the traditional "source iteration" iterative method.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} several novel methods based on or related to least-squares {{transport}} residual for solving deterministic radiation transport problems. For {{the first part}} of this dissertation a nonlinear spherical harmonics (PN) closure (TPN) was developed based on analysis of the least-squares residual for time-dependent PN equations in 1 D slab geometry. The TPN closure suppresses the oscillations induced by Gibbs phenomenon in time-dependent transport calculations effectively. Simultaneously, a nonlinear viscosity term based on the spatial and temporal variations is realized and used in the extension to filtered PN method (NFPN). NFPN determines the angular viscosity on the fly and potentially fixed the issue existed in linear FPN that filtering strength needs to be predefined by iteratively solving the problem. We further developed another type of NFPN and demonstrate both of the two NFPN preserve the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit for thermal radiative transfer problems theoretically and numerically. We also developed several novel methods along with error analyses for steady-state neutron transport calculations based on least-squares methods. Firstly, a relaxed L 1 finite element method was developed based on nonlinearly weighting the least-squares formulation by the pointwise transport residual. In problems such as void and near-void situations where least-squares accuracy is poor, the L 1 method improves the solution. Further, a non-converged RL 1 still can present comparable accuracy. We then developed a least-squares method based on a novel contiguous-discontinuous functional. A proof is provided for the conservation preservation for such a method, which is significant for problems such as k-eigenvalue calculations. Also, a second order accuracy is observed with much lower error magnitudes in several quantities of interest for heterogeneous problems compared with self-adjoint angular flux (SAAF) solution. Lastly, we extended the CD methodology with 1 /?t-weighted least-squares functional to derive a CD-SAAF method and developed a SN-PN angular hybrid scheme. The hybrid scheme can employ high order SN in regions with strong transport feature to couple with low order PN in regions with diffusive flux. In k-eigenvalue calculations, it shows superb accuracy with low degrees of freedom...|$|E

Two inertial-acoustic modes in a geometrically thin, radiative cooling dominated disk depart {{from each other}} if very little advection is included.

40|$|Cross-plane superlattices {{composed}} of nanoscale layers of alternating potential wells and barriers have attracted great attention for their potential to provide thermoelectric power factor improvements and higher ZT figure of merit. Previous theoretical works {{have shown that}} the presence of optimized potential barriers could provide improvements to the Seebeck coefficient through carrier energy filtering, which improves the power factor by up to 40 %. However, experimental corroboration of this prediction has been extremely scant. In this work, we employ quantum mechanical electronic transport simulations to outline the detrimental effects of random variation, imperfections and nonoptimal barrier shapes in a superlattice geometry on these predicted power factor improvements. Thus we aim to assess either the robustness or the fragility of these theoretical gains {{in the face of the}} types of variation one would find in real material systems. We show that these power factor improvements are relatively robust against: overly <b>thick</b> barriers, <b>diffusion</b> of barriers into the body of the wells, and random fluctuations in barrier spacing and width. However, notably, we discover that extremely thin barriers and random fluctuation in barrier heights by as little as 10 % is sufficient to entirely destroy any power factor benefits of the optimized geometry. Our results could provide performance optimization routes for nanostructured thermoelectrics and elucidate the reasons why significant power factor improvements are not commonly realized in superlattices, despite theoretical predictions.

40|$|International audienceTheoretical {{analysis}} {{has been developed}} for the reduction reaction of the non-electroactive bromate anion from its aqueous solution at a thin-layer porous electrode {{on the surface of}} a membrane transporting protons from anode under steady-state 1 D conditions. The cathodic process is realized via a cycle composed of the reversible Br 2 to 2 Br− transformation and of the irreversible (owing to high acidity of the solution) comproportionation reaction between bromate and bromide which regenerates bromine. Protons (assumed to be in great excess) are transported to the comproportionation-reaction (kinetic) layer near the electrode both via the membrane and from the bulk solution. As it has been demonstrated by calculations for the dependence of the local value of the maximal current density, jmax, on the local value of the diffusion layer thickness, zd, high values of the current density cannot be achieved for relatively thin diffusion layers. Contrary to intuitive expectations, for sufficiently <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> layers the current density may reach extremely high values comparable with the diffusion-limited flux of bromate anions (if they could react at the electrode), even for a tracer amount of Br 2 in the bulk solution. Such strong steady-state currents originate from the autocatalytic character of this redox-mediating cycle (EC″ mechanism) resulting in progressive accumulation of the components of the Br 2 /Br− mediating redox couple near the electrode surface. Relations between the fluxes of bromate and bromide anions, protons and bromine across the diffusion layer in solution as well as the flux of protons across the membrane have been established. Approximate analytical expressions for all characteristics of the system (concentration profiles, maximal current, etc.) have been derived for two regimes corresponding either to “weak currents” or to “thin kinetic layer”. The quantitative criterion for protons to be considered as being in great excess compared to bromate anions has been derived for both an ion-impermeable electrode/bromate solution cell (corresponding to the rotating-disk electrode system, RDE) and a proton-exchange membrane/porous electrode/bromate solution configuration...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} {{improvements}} to the discrete ordinates (S_N) neutron transport equation using a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) spatial discretization on arbitrary polytope (polygonal and polyhedral) grids compatible for massively-parallel computer architectures. Polytope meshes are attractive for multiple reasons, including their use in other physics communities and their ease in handling local mesh refinement strategies. In this work, we focus on two topical areas of research. First, we discuss higher-order basis functions compatible to solve the DGFEM S_N transport equation on arbitrary polygonal meshes. Second, we assess Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) schemes compatible with polytope grids for massively-parallel transport problems. We first utilize basis functions compatible with arbitrary polygonal grids for the DGFEM transport equation. We analyze four different basis functions that have linear completeness on polygons: the Wachspress rational functions, the PWL functions, the mean value coordinates, and the maximum entropy coordinates. We then describe the procedure to extend these polygonal linear basis functions into the quadratic serendipity space of functions. These quadratic basis functions can exactly interpolate monomial functions up to order 2. Both the linear and quadratic sets of basis functions preserve transport solutions in the <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> limit. Maximum convergence rates of 2 and 3 are observed for regular transport solutions for the linear and quadratic basis functions, respectively. For problems that are limited by the regularity of the transport solution, convergence rates of 3 / 2 (when the solution is continuous) and 1 / 2 (when the solution is discontinuous) are observed. Spatial Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) achieved superior convergence rates than uniform refinement, even for problems bounded by the solution regularity. We demonstrated accuracy in the AMR solutions {{by allowing them to}} reach a level where the ray effects of the angular discretization are realized. Next, we analyzed DSA schemes to accelerate both the within-group iterations as well as the thermal upscattering iterations for multigroup transport problems. Accelerating the thermal upscattering iterations is important for materials (e. g., graphite) with significant thermal energy scattering and minimal absorption. All of the acceleration schemes analyzed use a DGFEM discretization of the diffusion equation that is compatible with arbitrary polytope meshes: the Modified Interior Penalty Method (MIP). MIP uses the same DGFEM discretization as the transport equation. The MIP form is Symmetric Positive De_nite (SPD) and e_ciently solved with Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) with Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioning. The analysis from previous work was extended to show MIP's stability and robustness for accelerating 3 D transport problems. MIP DSA preconditioning was implemented in the Parallel Deterministic Transport (PDT) code at Texas A&M University and linked with the HYPRE suite of linear solvers. Good scalability was numerically verified out to around 131 K processors. The fraction of time spent performing DSA operations was small for problems with sufficient work performed in the transport sweep (O(10 ^ 3) angular directions). Finally, we have developed a novel methodology to accelerate transport problems dominated by thermal neutron upscattering. Compared to historical upscatter acceleration methods, our method is parallelizable and amenable to massively parallel transport calculations. Speedup factors of about 3 - 4 were observed with our new method...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2015. Major: Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. Advisor: Krishnan Mahesh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 122 pages. Autoignition {{is an important}} phenomenon and a tool {{in the design of}} combustion engines. To study autoignition in a canonical form a direct numerical simulation of a turbulent autoigniting hydrogen jet in vitiated coflow conditions at a jet Reynolds number of 10, 000 is performed. A detailed chemical mechanism for hydrogen-air combustion and non-unity Lewis numbers for species transport is used. Realistic inlet conditions are prescribed by obtaining the velocity eld from a fully developed turbulent pipe flow simulation. To perform this simulation a scalable modular density based method for direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) of compressible reacting flows is developed. The algorithm performs explicit time advancement of transport variables on structured grids. An iterative semi-implicit time advancement is developed for the chemical source terms to alleviate the chemical stiffness of detailed mechanisms. The algorithm is also extended from a Cartesian grid to a cylindrical coordinate system which introduces a singularity at the pole r = 0 where terms with a factor 1 /r can be ill-defined. There are several approaches to eliminate this pole singularity and finite volume methods can bypass this issue by not storing or computing data at the pole. All methods however face a very restrictive time step when using a explicit time advancement scheme in the azimuthal direction (θ) where the cell sizes are of the order θ. We use a conservative finite volume based approach to remove the severe time step restriction imposed by the CFL condition by merging cells in the azimuthal direction. In addition, fluxes in the radial direction are computed with an implicit scheme to allow cells to be clustered along the jet's shear layer. This method is validated and used to perform the large scale turbulent reacting simulation. The resulting flame structure is found to be similar to a turbulent diusion flame but stabilized by autoignition at the flame base. Mass-fraction of the hydroperoxyl radical, HO 2, peaks in magnitude upstream of the flame's stabilization point indicating autoignition. A flame structure similar to a triple-flame, with a lean premixed flame and a rich premixed flame flanking a <b>thick</b> <b>diffusion</b> flame is identified by the flame index. Radicals formed in the shear layer ahead of ignition and oxygen from the coflow do not get fully consumed by the flame and are transported along the edges of the flame brush into the core of the jet. Ignition delays from a well-stirred reactor model and an autoigniting diffusion flame model are able predict the lift-off height of the turbulent flame. The local entrainment rate was observed to increase with axial distance until the flame stabilization point and then decrease downstream. Data from probes placed along the flame reveals a highly turbulent flow field with variable composition at a given location. In general however, it is observed that the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is very high in cold fuel rich mixtures and is lowest in hot fuel lean mixtures. Autoignition occurs at the most-reactive hot and lean mixture fractions where the TKE is the lowest...|$|E

This study presents one approach that has been developed to characterize and predict the degradation of polymers used as thermal insulation materials.

For dry sliding low load and speed combinations were chosen to correspond to the mild wear region below the Welsh T 1 transition. Lubricated tests were conducted under flooded conditions using Esso Technical White Oil alone and with a 0. 1 % stearic acid additive, for load and speed ranges that produced substantial amounts of asperity contact and thus a boundary lubricated regime of wear. The test material in all cases was AISI 52100 steel, for unlubricated sliding subjected to loads from 5 to 50 N and a range of speeds from 10 - 3 to 1. 0 ms- 1, and for lubricated sliding loads of 50 to 123 N and for speeds of 10 - 2 to 1. 0 ms- 1. Unlubricated wear debris was found to be a mixture of -Fe_ 2 O_ 3 and -Fe. Unlubricated wear was found to occur via a thin film logarithmic oxide growth followed by agglomeration into thicker oxide plateaux 2 to 10 m in thickness. Lubricated wear occurred via <b>thick</b> film <b>diffusion</b> controlled oxide growth producing homogeneous oxide plateaux 0. 1 to 0. 2 m in thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identified the presence of a surface film on pins worn in White Oil with stearic acid, which is thought to be iron stearate.

However, we recently demonstrated that a pseudocapacitive mechanism occurs when lithium ions are inserted into mesoporous and nanocrystal films of orthorhombic Nb 2 O 5 (T-Nb 2 O 5; refs 1, 2). Here, we quantify the kinetics of charge storage in T-Nb 2 O 5 : currents that vary inversely with time, charge-storage capacity that is mostly independent of rate, and redox peaks that exhibit small voltage offsets even at high rates. We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within {{short periods of time}} because there are no limitations from solid-state <b>diffusion.</b> <b>Thick</b> electrodes (up to 40 [*]μm thick) prepared with T-Nb 2 O 5 offer the promise of exploiting intercalation pseudocapacitance to obtain high-rate charge-storage devices...|$|R
