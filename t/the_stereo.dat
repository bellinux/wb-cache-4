5|$|The band applied {{microphone}} placement techniques {{similar to}} those which many orchestras used. The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately on <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.|$|E

5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of <b>the</b> <b>stereo.</b> It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing.

The Keystone View Company produced more than 100 stereographs of the Gold Rush. The view "Bound for the Klondike Gold Fields" (several slightly different views with this title exist) inspired Charlie Chaplin's motion picture "The Gold Rush," produced in 1923. After Chaplin saw the stereoviews while visiting Douglas Fairbanks at his home "Pickfair," he used <b>the</b> <b>stereos</b> as source material for the film.

5|$|After the Second World War, the Sadler's Wells {{company made}} a 78 r.p.m. set of {{excerpts}} from Simon Boccanegra (1949), but made no more recordings until <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> LP era. In the 1950s and 1960s, the company recorded {{a series of}} abridged sets of operas and operettas for EMI, each occupying two LP sides. All were sung in English. The opera sets were Madame Butterfly (1960), Il trovatore (1962), and Hansel and Gretel (1966). The abridged operetta recordings were Die Fledermaus (1959), The Merry Widow (1959), The Land of Smiles (1960), La vie parisienne (1961), Orpheus in the Underworld (1960), Iolanthe (1962), La belle Hélène (1963) and The Gypsy Baron (1965). A complete recording of The Mikado was released in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> soundscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E

5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of <b>the</b> <b>Stereo</b> 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} LP era little of Holst's music was {{available}} on disc.

In <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> LP and CD eras numerous recordings of The Planets were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By {{the early years of the}} 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD. Of the operas, Savitri, The Wandering Scholar, and At the Boar's Head have been recorded.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} how various viewing conditions affect the accuracy and response {{time of the}} perception of stereopsis. Based on prior research findings, three specific hypotheses have been formulated relative to the main research question: (1) Stereopsis threshold (accuracy) and efficiency (response time in step-vergence) will be best for 3 D-viewing conditions containing only local cues to fusion, intermediate for viewing conditions containing a combination of global and local cues, and worst for the viewing conditions containing only global cues. (2) Subjects with a lower (better) Titmus Stereoacuity threshold at 40 cm will have faster response times and better accuracy on all three types of stereo tests than subjects with a worse stereoacuity. (3) Subjects with a lower Distance Randot stereoacuity threshold at 3 m will have faster response times and better accuracy on all three types of stereo tests than subjects with a worse stereoacuity. METHODS: Ninety adult subjects (ages 19 - 43) with 120 arc seconds of near stereoacuity or better were recruited. Individual stereoscopic threshold and step-vergence efficiency were measured under three different testing conditions: Blank background Stereogram (BBS), Random Dot Stereogram (RDS), and Random Dot with Reference Frame Stereogram (RDRFS) for each subject. These tests were developed at the Vision Performance Institute and will hereafter by referred as <b>the</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests. <b>The</b> derived stereoacuity thresholds were also compared to the traditional clinical standard, <b>the</b> Titmus <b>Stereo</b> Test (for near viewing) and <b>the</b> Distance Randot <b>Stereo</b> Test (for far viewing). RESULTS: Mean stereoacuity threshold performance achieved was lowest (best) for <b>the</b> Titmus <b>Stereo</b> Test, intermediate for <b>the</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests (BBS 3 ̆c RDS 3 ̆c RDRFS), and highest (worst) for <b>the</b> Distance Randot <b>Stereo</b> Test. <b>The</b> majority of the subjects provided verbal feedback that RDRFS was easier to perform than RDS on both the stereoacuity and the step-vergence tasks. Step-vergence performance resulted in the fastest response time for BBS, intermediate response time for RDRFS, and the slowest response time for RDS. Response time {{was found to be}} faster when responding to visual stimuli exhibiting crossed disparity, and slower with uncrossed disparity. The majority of subjects responded fastest to the smallest amounts of disparity demand (20 pixels, 651 arc sec) and slowest to the largest amounts of disparity demand (80 pixels, 2604 arc sec). Threshold stereoacuity performance on both <b>the</b> Titmus <b>Stereo</b> Test and <b>the</b> Distance Randot <b>Stereo</b> Test was not predictive of accuracy or response time performance on any of <b>the</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests. CONCLUSIONS: Using <b>the</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests, <b>the</b> effects of local and global cues on stereopsis were compared directly. Threshold stereo acuity and vergence efficiency with local cues were better than with global cues. The distance measures of stereoacuity with VPI Stereo Tests are comparable with the near-viewing stereoacuity measured with <b>the</b> Titmus <b>Stereo</b> Test, which is considered the traditional clinical standard. <b>The</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests are more sensitive at assessing fusion ability than <b>the</b> Distance Randot <b>Stereo</b> Test, which is one distance-viewing stereo test currently on the market. Future studies should explore the comparison between <b>the</b> Titmus <b>Stereo</b> Test and <b>the</b> VPI <b>Stereo</b> Tests using manipulated viewing distance to lower the threshold scale via a population with normal binocular vision...|$|R
