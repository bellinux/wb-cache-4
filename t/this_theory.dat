5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, <b>this</b> <b>theory</b> subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying <b>this</b> <b>theory</b> on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of <b>this</b> <b>theory</b> to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an indication that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E

5|$|Epicoxal hypothesis: <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> {{suggested}} that a possible origin for insect wings {{might have been the}} movable abdominal gills found in many aquatic insects, such as on naiads of mayflies. According to <b>this</b> <b>theory</b> these tracheal gills, which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal gills are equipped with little winglets that perpetually vibrate and have their own tiny straight muscles.|$|E

5|$|The first {{theory is}} that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an {{unspecified}} reason, and that the Greeks moved {{to take advantage of this}} by attacking. <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the Suda dictionary. The entry χωρίς ἰππεῖς ("without cavalry") is explained thus: The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when Miltiades realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle. There are many variations of <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon. <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred before the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to who}} the statue represents. One theory holds {{that it is a}} relief of the Buddha in a sitting posture. According to <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> those holding the chauris are Bodhisattvas flanking the Buddha. According to George Michell, the halo, the Pipal tree and cloak-like dress suggests that this was originally a Buddha statue. The shrine, states <b>this</b> <b>theory,</b> was converted to Hindu worship in recent times. According to B.V. Shettiarchaeologist and curator of Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, the cave was not converted but from the start represented a tribute to Mayamoha of the Hindu Puranas, or Buddhavatara Vishnu (ninth avatar of Vishnu). <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> is supported by the chakra, conch and jewelry included in its iconography. The style suggests it was likely carved in or before the 8thcentury.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. <b>This</b> <b>theory</b> is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

5|$|A third theory, {{supported}} by both Serbian and Bulgarian researchers, is that despot Michael is an unknown son of Michael Asen IV, the first-born son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371), who was proclaimed co-tsar {{shortly after his}} father's accession and died in a battle against the Ottomans before 1354–1355. Against this identification is the account of Nikephoros Gregoras, who mentions that Michael Asen's widow returned childless to Constantinople after his death. Another issue with <b>this</b> <b>theory</b> is that no source mentions Michael Asen as a despot.|$|E
