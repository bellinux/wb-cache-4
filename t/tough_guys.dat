Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E

Corral (1957), The Devil's Disciple (1959), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), Seven Days in May (1964), Victory at Entebbe (1976) and <b>Tough</b> <b>Guys</b> (1986), which fixed {{the notion of the}} pair as {{something}} of a team in the public imagination. Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of I Walk Alone, in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were {{more or less the same}} size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.|$|E

500|$|James Francis Cagney Jr. (July 17, 1899March 30, 1986) was an American {{actor and}} dancer, both {{on stage and}} in film, though he had his {{greatest}} impact in film. Known for his consistently energetic performances, distinctive vocal style, and deadpan comic timing, he won acclaim and major awards {{for a wide variety}} of performances. He is best remembered for playing multifaceted <b>tough</b> <b>guys</b> in movies such as The Public Enemy (1931), Taxi! (1932), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), and White Heat (1949), and was typecast or limited by this view earlier in his career. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him eighth among its list of greatest male stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

Wheaton later recalled he felt intimidated by Tierney during filming, as he was 15 and Tierney {{had a reputation for}} having a character similar to the <b>tough</b> <b>guys</b> he typically played.

500|$|Film and theatre {{historian}} Ethan Mordden {{has identified}} The Hustler {{as one of}} a handful of films from the early 1960s that re-defined the relationship of films to their audiences. This new relationship, he writes, is [...] "one of challenge rather than flattery, of doubt rather than certainty." [...] No film of the 1950s, Mordden asserts, [...] "took such a brutal, clear look at the ego-affirmation of the one-on-one contest, at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser." [...] Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir, Mordden rejects the comparison based on Rossen's ultra-realistic style, also noting that the film lacks noir's [...] "Treacherous Woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie, hungry bank clerks and lusty wives." [...] Mordden does note that while Fast Eddie [...] "has a slight fifties ring", the character [...] "makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling <b>tough</b> <b>guys</b> of the 'rebel' era... ut he does end up seeking out his emotions" [...] and telling Bert that he is a loser because he's dead inside.|$|E
500|$|Canadian diplomat Pierre Dupuy {{was named}} Commissioner General, after Diefenbaker {{appointee}} Paul Bienvenu {{resigned from the}} post in 1963. One of the main responsibilities of the Commissioner General was to attract other nations to build pavilions at Expo. [...] Dupuy would spend most of 1964 and 1965 soliciting 125 countries, spending more time abroad than in Canada. [...] Dupuy's 'right-hand' man was Robert Fletcher Shaw, the deputy commissioner general and vice-president of the corporation. [...] He also replaced a Diefenbaker appointee, C.F. Carsley, Deputy Commissioner General. [...] Shaw was a professional engineer and builder, and is widely credited for the total building of the Exhibition. [...] Dupuy hired Andrew Kniewasser as the general manager. The management group became known as Les Durs - the <b>tough</b> <b>guys</b> - {{and they were in}} charge of creating, building and managing Expo. Les Durs consisted of: Jean-Claude Delorme, Legal Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation; Dale Rediker, Director of Finances; Colonel Edward Churchill, Director of Installations; Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien, Director of Operations, dubbed [...] "The Mayor of Expo"; Pierre de Bellefeuille, Director of Exhibitors; and Yves Jasmin, Director of Information, Advertising and Public Relations.
