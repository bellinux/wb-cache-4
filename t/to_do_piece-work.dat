The worst passions of our nature are enlisted in support of piece-work. Avarice, meanness, cunning, hypocrisy, all excite and feed upon the miserable votary who works by the task and not by the hour.

60|$|It is, however, to be {{considered}} that the principal defects of the present system in respect to the efficiency of labor may be corrected, and the chief advantages of Communism in that respect may be obtained, by arrangements compatible with private property and individual competition. Considerable improvement is already obtained by piece-work, {{in the kinds of}} labor which admit of it. By this the workman's personal interest is closely connected with the quantity of work he turns out--not so much with its quality, the security for which still has to depend on the employer's vigilance; neither <b>does</b> <b>piece-work</b> carry with it the public opinion of the workman class, which is often, on the contrary, strongly opposed to it, as a means of (as they think) diminishing the market for laborers. And there is really good ground for their dislike of piece-work, if, as is alleged, it is a frequent practice of employers, after using piece-work to ascertain the utmost which a good workman can <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> fix the price of piece-work so low that by doing that utmost he is not able to earn more than they would be obliged to give him as day wages for ordinary work.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on whether we can have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we are unable <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I take as my starting point two papers recently published in Philosophical Studies, by Bart Streumer and Ulrike Heuer, which defend the two dominant opposing positions on this issue. Briefly, whereas Streumer argues that we cannot have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we are unable <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Heuer argues {{that we can have}} reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when we can get closer to success but cannot have reason <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when we cannot get closer to success. In this paper, I reject both positions as they are presented, on the grounds that neither can accommodate an important category of reasons, which are the reasons to realise and to try to realise dimensions of value that lie at the boundary of what is realisable, specifically, genuinely valuable ideals. I defend a third view that we can have reason <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we are unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> even when we cannot, in Heuer's sense, get closer to success. Moreover, I argue that we can have reason to realise and to try to realise genuinely valuable ideals for their own sake and not simply for the sake of achieving mundane, realisable ends...|$|R

50|$|These {{views in}} moral {{psychology}} have various implications. In particular, if motivational internalism is true, then an amoralist is unintelligible (and metaphysically impossible).
