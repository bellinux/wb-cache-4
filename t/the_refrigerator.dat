When <b>the</b> first <b>refrigerator</b> is operated and therefore cold, the first pump which is thermally coupled to it is also cooled and adsorbs gas to withdraw it from the second heat switch, to thereby thermally isolate the sink device from <b>the</b> warm second <b>refrigerator.</b> With <b>the</b> second <b>refrigerator</b> being warm, <b>the</b> second pump is also warm and desorbs gas, so the gas lies in the first switch, to close that switch and therefore thermally couple <b>the</b> cold first <b>refrigerator</b> to <b>the</b> sink device.

5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E

40|$|The {{pulse-tube}} type of two-piston Stirling refrigerator {{can improve}} reliability {{by moving the}} expansion piston from the cold end to the ambient temperature end. More recently, <b>the</b> thermo-acoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> further improves reliability by eliminating the expansion piston. <b>The</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> uses a traveling-wave loop to achieve the Stirling cycle. Both refrigerators have a pulse tube. By means of thermodynamic analysis of <b>the</b> two <b>refrigerators,</b> this paper draws the following conclusions. Firstly, the pulse tube type of Stirling refrigerator can readily achieve any needed phase shifting by controlling the expansion piston, {{and it does not}} have to rely on the flowing resistance of the regenerator and the compliance and inertance effects of the different thermodynamic components that make contributions to phase shifting of the pressure and velocity waves. In contrast, <b>the</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> is not able to perform active phase shifting, and its phase shifting mechanism is completely passive and somewhat dissipative because the flow resistance of the regenerator is a necessary part of the passive phase shifting. As a result, the pulse-tube type of two-piston Stirling refrigerator can achieve a little higher efficiency than <b>the</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator.</b> Secondly, <b>the</b> standing-wave acoustic field in the com-pression space of <b>the</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> is predominant, resulting in smaller power flow for the same pressure wave amplitude and swept volume. In other words, <b>the</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> may give smaller cooling power with the same working conditions and compo-nent sizes. Actually, the calculations show that <b>the</b> two-piston Stirling <b>refrigerator</b> gives a much larger cooling capacity than <b>the</b> thermoacoustic-Stirling <b>refrigerator...</b>|$|R
