5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E

25|$|These {{treatment}} regimens {{last from}} one to four weeks. If joint swelling persists or returns, {{a second round of}} antibiotics may be considered. Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no clinical evidence shows it to be effective.

As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recommended.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{determination}} of cross-dressing is largely socially constructed. For example, in Western society, trousers {{have long been}} adopted for usage by women, {{and it is no}} longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the kilt or sarong, these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be simple}} {{to write down}} the {{equations}} of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always {{the most efficient way}} to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.|$|E

25|$|Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Poland Prosecution Service in Gliwice {{launched}} their own investigation while assisting Canadian police visiting Poland {{as part of}} the Canadian investigation. Polish criminal code allows for the pursuit of foreign nationals suspected of committing crime against the Polish citizens abroad; which could lead to an extradition request. The Prosecution Office forwarded a request for assistance from Canada. The request for documents from the Canadian investigation was denied with the rationale that forwarding <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{in the best interest of}} that country. Under the circumstances, in December 2011 the Polish investigation was terminated.|$|E
25|$|It {{is a fine}} {{thing that}} a man astride two wheels can, in a six-day race, {{distance}} a hound, horse, or a locomotive. It confirms the assumption, no longer much contested, that the human animal is superior to the other animals.
