5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|At its U.S. debut, the {{redesigned}} LS 400 {{retained a}} pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market, launching with a base price of US$51,000. However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers. To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, {{the most expensive}} marketing effort since {{the launch of the}} division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.|$|E

5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

5|$|The Kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar {{were used}} for drawing the {{carriages}} of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals.

5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of the WAVES and Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent {{two or three days}} at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether demobilization meant phasing women out of the military services altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom on vinyl in mid-December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later. A gatefold cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold for about <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to pricing Americanstyle derivatives. By approximating the value function with a piecewise linear interpolation function, the option holder's continuation value can be expressed as <b>a</b> summation <b>of</b> European call option values.

5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{she began}} writing her autobiography, {{with the support}} of a group of American admirers, {{including}} journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, Living My Life, as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf, however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due {{in large part to the}} Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Saturday Review of Literature all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.|$|E

5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however {{the result is a}} bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 2009, {{weeks after}} the stadium opened, part of the ground's away section was {{earmarked}} for conversion into terracing. This was because of high demand from away supporters, who had previously {{had to pay for}} a seating ticket, even though they preferred to stand. Even before this remodelling was complete, Malmö FF lowered the away ticket prices to match <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home terracing ticket. This restructuring was completed before the 2010 season. The terracing for the home supporters was also modified to ease mobility, and combat safety issues in the stands. The old pitch was removed and a new one was installed in preparation for the 2015 Allsvenskan season. The new surface was produced from the same Dutch grass producer who will provide the pitch for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final at Olympiastadion Berlin. UEFA had previously criticized the surface at the stadium following the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage.|$|E
