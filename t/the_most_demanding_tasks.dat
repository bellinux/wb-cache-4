Temperature, strain and ambient vibration records are analysed and two main directions of investigation are pursued. The first and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>task</b> is to develop processing routines able to extract modal parameters from ambient vibration measurements.

After selecting a baseline of modal parameters, the evolution of eigenfrequencies is studied and correlated to environmental and operational factors. The second aspect deals with the structural response to passing trains. Corresponding triggered records of strain and temperature are processed and their assessment is accomplished using the average strains induced by each train as the reference parameter. Three influences due to speed, temperature and loads are distinguished and treated individually. An attempt to estimate the maximum response variation due to each factor is also carried out...|$|R

Unlike mainstream applications which merely demand visually convincing images and short rendering times, physically based rendering emphasises accuracy {{at the cost of}} increased computational overhead.
