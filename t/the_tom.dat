5|$|Wills' unmarked gravesite was {{restored}} in 1980 with a headstone erected by the MCC and by public subscription. He {{was inducted into}} the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989 and was made an inaugural member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996. <b>The</b> <b>Tom</b> Wills Room in the MCG's Great Southern Stand serves as a venue for corporate functions. A statue outside the MCG, sculpted by Louis Laumen and erected in 2001, depicts Wills umpiring the famous 1858 football match between Melbourne Grammar and Scotch College. The AFL commemorated the 150th anniversary of the match by staging <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Wills Round during the 2008 AFL Season. The two schools played in a curtain raiser at the MCG ahead of the round opener between Melbourne and Geelong. That same year, Victoria's busiest freeway interchange, the Monash–EastLink interchange in Dandenong North, was named <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Wills Interchange. Tom Wills Oval, inaugurated in 2013 at Sydney Olympic Park, serves as the training base for the Greater Western Sydney Giants of the AFL.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom as a {{scientist}} {{as well as an}} inventor whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have unexpected and negative repercussions.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa DeSimone had been working as a {{part-time}} barmaid in <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Tackle public house (now called The Encore public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton. By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at the pub {{for less than a}} month, working two evenings each week, partly to widen her social circle and partly to supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her shift at <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discothèque was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving DeSimone's Ford Escort in the pub car park.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean.

5|$|A Tom Swift media project {{finally came}} to {{fruition}} in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom Swift along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, <b>The</b> <b>Tom</b> Swift and Linda Craig Mystery Hour, which was broadcast on July 3. It was a ratings failure. In 2007, digital studio Worldwide Biggies acquired movie rights to Tom Swift. and announced plans to release a feature film and video game, followed by a television series.

5|$|Gay {{holds the}} US {{record in the}} 100m with 9.69s, making him the joint second fastest sprinter, along with Yohan Blake, {{in the history of}} the event after Usain Bolt. His 19.58s makes him history's sixth fastest 200m runner and the USA's fourth fastest. In 2010 Gay was a member of the fifth-fastest 4 x 100m relay team in history, running a 37.45s with {{teammates}} Trell Kimmons, Wallace Spearmon and Michael Rodgers in Weltklasse Zürich 2010. His sprint combination of 100m and 200m in 9.84s and 19.62s, run over two days in 2007, was the best ever combo at that time. During <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Jones Memorial Classic in Gainesville on April 17, 2010 Tyson Gay clocked 44.89 in the 400m event and became the first man in history to dip under 10.00 in the 100m, under 20.00 in the 200m and under 45.00 in the 400m.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
40|$|Turbulent {{convection}} {{is inherently}} non-local and a primary condition {{for a successful}} treatment of the PBL is a reliable model of non-locality. In the dynamic equations governing the convective flux, turbulent kinetic energy, etc, non-locality enters through <b>the</b> third-order moments, <b>TOMs.</b> Since <b>the</b> simplest form, the so-called down gradient approximation (DGA, severely underestimates <b>the</b> <b>TOMs</b> (by up to an order of magnitude), a more physical model is needed. In 1994, an analytical model was presented which was derived directly from the dynamical equations for <b>the</b> <b>TOMs.</b> It considerably improved the DGA but was a bit cumbersome to use. Here, we present a new analytic expression for <b>the</b> <b>TOMs</b> which is considerably simpler than the 1994 expression and which {{at the same time}} yields a much better fit to the LES data...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other film tie-in games, which often closely follow {{the events of}} their source material, the development team of Escape from Butcher Bay focused on differentiating the game from The Chronicles of Riddick. They sought to explore Riddick's character in a prison break setting, and took inspiration from films such as Escape from Alcatraz. Starbreeze was also inspired by video games such as GoldenEye 007 and <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Clancy's Splinter Cell series. The opening sequence, in which Riddick is escorted into Butcher Bay, {{is a tribute to}} Half-Life, and the game's hand-to-hand combat was inspired by Punch-Out!!. Starbreeze focused solely on developing the game's single-player mode, and did not include multiplayer; the company believed that such a mode would require a design team twice as large and another year of development.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} entry in <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Clancy's Rainbow Six series and {{the successor to}} , a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E

He was present at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>Tom</b> Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
