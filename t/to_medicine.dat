40|$|This chapter will {{introduce}} you to key issues and resources in access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> and human rights. In addition, this chapter will help you understand why, more now than ever, access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> must be understood and approached as a human rights issue. Some of these issues are also addressed in Chapter 1 on Patient Care, Chapter 2 on HIV/AIDS, Chapter 3 on Tuberculosis and Human Rights, and Chapter 5 on Palliative Care and Human Rights. The chapter is organized into ve sections that answer the following questions: 1. How is access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> a human rights issue? 2. What is a human rights-based approach to advocacy, litigation, and programming? 3. What are some examples of effective human rights-based work {{in the area of}} access <b>to</b> <b>medicines?</b> 4.

40|$|The sub-Saharan African people {{experience}} the greatest {{burden of disease}} in the world although medicines exist that can treat {{the majority of the}} illnesses afflicting them. In fact, many essential medicines are not accessible for {{most of the people in}} the region. While the lack of resources is apparently a major impediment for access <b>to</b> <b>medicines,</b> man-made deliberations are also consequential, and can to some extent be influenced by regulation. The research question of this thesis therefore is: “can a human right <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> be utilised <b>to</b> solve the problem of access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in sub-Saharan Africa?”. In effect, in the last decade the notion of an international human right <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> has started <b>to</b> develop in the human rights law and literature, prescribing that ultimately all individuals shall have access <b>to</b> <b>medicines.</b> This work contributes to the international human rights law doctrine by studying this area of the law, which is still largely uncharted. The thesis, furthermore, moves from a descriptive analysis of the law and undertakes a critical normative enquiry, underscoring the challenges of utilising human rights law to guide and redress access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. In effect, the contingencies of access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> within complex health systems make it practically difficult to identify the appropriate arrangement of access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in a country. Moreover, policies and regulation for access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> can be morally questionable if conflicting with individuals’ legitimate rights, interests, needs and liberties. The relevance and merits of my arguments are grounded on different instances of critical-analytical research. I will use in particular interdisciplinary and empirical research on access <b>to</b> <b>medicines,</b> including a two-month field work in Tanzania, as well as the theoretical insights drawn from Luhmann’s social systems theory and Foucault’s theory of biopower. Therefore the thesis provides an ethical analysis of the potential operationalisation and implementation of the human right <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis is also a case-study intervention to the debates concerning more generally health care, public health, development and human rights in the region. Moreover, the thesis contributes to socio-legal studies identifying the phenomena of autopoiesis, contingency, power and the limits of steering affecting human rights, law and politics...|$|R

5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct <b>to</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Medicines are {{considered}} one of the main tools of western <b>medicine</b> <b>to</b> resolve health problems. Currently, medicines represent an important share of the countries' healthcare budget. In the Latin America region, access <b>to</b> essential <b>medicines</b> is still a challenge, although countries have established some measures in the last years in order to guarantee equitable access <b>to</b> <b>medicines.</b> A theoretical model is proposed for analysing the social, political, and economic factors that modulate the role of medicines as a health need and their influence on the accessibility and access <b>to</b> <b>medicines.</b> The model was built based on a narrative review about health needs, and followed the conceptual modelling methodology for theory-building. The theoretical model considers elements (stakeholders, policies) that modulate the perception towards medicines as a health need from two perspectives - health and market - at three levels: international, national and local levels. The perception towards medicines as a health need is described according to Bradshaw's categories: felt need, normative need, comparative need and expressed need. When those different categories applied <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> coincide, the patients get access <b>to</b> the <b>medicines</b> they perceive as a need, but when the categories do not coincide, barriers <b>to</b> access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> are created. Our theoretical model, which holds a broader view about the access <b>to</b> <b>medicines,</b> emphasises how power structures, interests, interdependencies, values and principles of the stakeholders could influence the perception towards medicines as a health need and the access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in Latin American countries...|$|R

He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> among displaced and non-displaced {{populations in}} urban areas in Bucaramanga, Colombia. A household survey was carried out to study access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> for self-reported and medically diagnosed health conditions. Multiple Poisson regression with robust variance {{was used to determine}} factors associated with access <b>to</b> <b>medicines.</b> Two thousand and sixty individuals from 514 families participated. Only 29. 1 % (95 %CI: 22. 04 - 37. 08) of the individuals in the sample with prescriptions and 44. 3 % (95 %CI: 40. 42 - 48. 25) with self-reported needs for pharmacotherapy were taking medicines. Greater access was associated with the perceived severity of the illness, higher income, having a health center nearby and not perceiving barriers in accessing services. Social security affiliation and being displaced were not related. Social security coverage alone does not have an effect on access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> because it does not include essential <b>medicines</b> that correspond <b>to</b> the health needs of this population.

40|$|Background Resources to {{help the}} older aged (≥ 65  year olds) manage their {{medicines}} should probably target those in greatest need. The older-aged have {{many different types of}} living circumstances. There are different locations (urban, rural), different types of housing (in the community or in retirement villages), different living arrangements (living alone or with others), and different socioeconomic status (SES) circumstances. However, there has been limited attention to whether these living circumstances affect adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in the ≥ 65  year olds. Aim of the review The aim was to determine whether comparative studies, including logistic regression studies, show that living circumstances affect adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> by the ≥ 65  year olds. Methods A literature search of Medline, CINAHL and the Internet (Google) was undertaken. Results Four comparative studies have not shown differences in adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> between the ≥ 65  year olds living in rural and urban locations, but one study shows lower adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> for osteoporosis in rural areas compared to metropolitan, and another study shows greater adherence <b>to</b> antihypertensive <b>medicines</b> in rural than urban areas. There are no comparative studies of adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> in the older-aged living in indigenous communities compared to other communities. There is conflicting evidence as to whether living alone, being unmarried, or having a low income/worth is associated with nonadherence. Preliminary studies have suggested that the older-aged living in rental, low SES retirement villages or leasehold, middle SES retirement villages have a lower adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> than those living in freehold, high SES retirement villages. Conclusions The ≥ 65  year olds living in rural communities may need extra help with adherence <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> for osteoporosis. The ≥ 65  year olds living in rental or leasehold retirement villages may require extra assistance/resources to adhere <b>to</b> their <b>medicines.</b> Further research is needed to clarify whether living under certain living circumstances (e. g. living alone, being unmarried, low income) has an effect on adherence, and to determine whether the ≥ 65  year olds living in indigenous communities need assistance to be adherent <b>to</b> prescribed <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Elements of Botany (1836), an {{introductory}} textbook, {{was the first}} of Gray's many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that botany was useful not only <b>to</b> <b>medicine,</b> but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the Flora of North America together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding had become so great, and he had become so influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: First Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology (1857) and How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural Botany (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so that high school students and non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Access {{to quality}} assured artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) has remained {{very low in}} most malaria endemic countries. A number of reasons, including unaffordable prices, {{have contributed to the}} low accessibility <b>to</b> these life-saving <b>medicines.</b> The Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria (AMFm) is a mechanism to increase access to quality assured ACT. The AMFm will use price signals and a combination of public and private sector channels to achieve multiple public health objectives: replacing older and increasingly ineffective anti-malarial medicines, such as chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine with ACT, displacing oral artemisinin monotherapies from the market, and prolonging the lifespan of ACT by reducing the likelihood of resistance to artemisinin. Access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> frameworks paint a broad picture of dimensions of access <b>to</b> <b>medicines</b> and juxtapose components that enhance or hinder access <b>to</b> <b>medicines.</b> Access requires various activities [...] funding, institutions, interventions, and thinking [...] from public and private actors at global, national, and local levels.
