40|$|In {{this comment}} {{we discuss the}} problem of {{reconciling}} the linear efficiency of price returns with the long-memory of supply and demand. We present new evidence that shows that efficiency is maintained by a liquidity imbalance that co-moves with the imbalance of buyer vs. seller initiated transactions. For example, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated transactions, there is also more liquidity for buy orders than sell orders, so that buy orders generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell orders. At the moment a buy order is placed the <b>transaction</b> <b>sign</b> imbalance tends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance rapidly increases with time, so that after {{a small number of}} time steps it cancels all the inefficiency caused by the <b>transaction</b> <b>sign</b> imbalance, bounding the price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and temporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue that viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a simpler and more natural view. This is {{in the spirit of the}} original conjecture of Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build up of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction. We discuss the possible strategic motivations that give rise to the liquidity imbalance and offer an alternative hypothesis. We also present some results that call into question the statistical significance of large swings in expected price impact at long times. ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the London Stock Exchange we {{investigate}} the influence of <b>signed</b> <b>transaction</b> order volume on current and future price changes. (Buy orders are given a positive sign, sell orders a negative sign). Empirical {{studies have shown that}} <b>transaction</b> order <b>signs</b> display long memory. Because buying tends to move the price up and selling tends to move the price down, this creates a puzzle regarding efficiency [...] if <b>transaction</b> order <b>signs</b> are highly predictable, why aren't prices predictable? We show that efficiency is maintained by correlated fluctuations in the response of prices to orders.

50|$|A {{theoretically}} {{effective method}} of combating any MitB attack is through an out-of-band (OOB) transaction verification process.

OOB transaction verification is ideal for mass market use since it leverages devices already {{in the public domain}} (e.g. landline, mobile phone, etc.) and requires no additional hardware devices yet enables three-factor authentication (utilising voice biometrics), <b>transaction</b> <b>signing</b> (to non-repudiation level) and transaction verification.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the random walk of prices {{by developing a}} simple model relating {{the properties of the}} signs and absolute values of individual price changes to the diffusion rate (volatility) of prices at longer time scales. We show that this benchmark model is unable to reproduce the diffusion properties of real prices. Specifically, we find that for one hour intervals this model consistently over-predicts the volatility of real price series by about 70 %, and that this effect becomes stronger as the length of the intervals increases. By selectively shuffling some components of the data while preserving others we are able to show that this discrepancy is caused by a subtle but long-range non-contemporaneous correlation between the signs and sizes of individual returns. We conjecture that this is related to the long-memory of <b>transaction</b> <b>signs</b> and the need to enforce market efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{biggest problem}} facing Internet banking {{today is the}} thorny issues of trust and {{security}} of online transactions. In fact, {{the vast majority of}} customers are concerned about the safety of their transaction, and they can’t simply trust the web fearing that their transactions and credentials might not be safe due to the increasing number of online Internet attacks. A new model for processing Internet banking transactions is presented in this paper, it increases trust and security over the existing model, by allowing customers and banks to authenticate each other, and <b>sign</b> processed <b>transactions</b> online, It enhances security through use of a three-tier, trusted, layered, and secure channel. The model ensures that only qualified people can access Internet banking accounts, that the information viewed remains private and can’t be modified by third parties, and that any transactions made are traceable and verifiable.

In contrast, trades for liquid stocks, trades by the crossing network brokerage desk, and members trading large blocks in negotiated crosses contain less information. These results suggest that while crossing networks provide a venue for large block trades to transact with little price impact, they also provide a venue for informed traders to trade, and this information appears to spill over and provide price discovery on the quoting exchanges...|$|R

In 1763 a forty-four-year-old miller in the Essex town of Billericay decided he {{had had enough of}} his obesity. The sense of suffocation Thomas Wood felt after eating only added to his head and stomach aches, disturbed sleep, vertigo, constant thirst, rheumatism, gout and epileptic fits. A local clergyman recommended an ‘exact regimen’. He advised Wood to read ‘Cornaro’s book’, which would ‘suggest to him a salutary course of living’. The simple advice of Alvise Cornaro—to embrace sobriety and avoid excess—evidently retained its appeal, despite being written two hundred years earlier. Wood became so enthused by the book’s contents that he immediately gave up his fatty meats, which ‘he ate voraciously three times a day’, his butter, cheese and large amounts of strong ale, in favour of a strict diet. Within a few years Wood was restored to perfect health, in body and spirit: enough to feature in an article of the London College of Physicians’ Medical <b>Transactions,</b> <b>signed</b> by reliable witnesses. To achieve this, Wood did not give up on physicians—indeed one of the signatories of the article was his doctor, Benjamin Pugh—but the go-it-alone philosophy struck a chord with eighteenth-century eaters, determined to reduce and regulate their intake of food and drink. 1...|$|R

The dynamics in the TARGET 2 are here explained as being due to a fall in the level of confidence in the capacity of the Economic and Monetary Union to survive, rather than to disparities in the level of competitiveness among countries of the Eurozone. This crisis of confidence has to be considered as the consequence of the implicit refusal of the European institutions to create a mechanism working as lender of last resort for the euro area member States; indeed, only when the ECB took this responsibility by launching the Outright Monetary <b>Transactions</b> clear <b>signs</b> of improvement were observed in the sovereign debt crisis...|$|R
