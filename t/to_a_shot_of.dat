5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> {{them on the}} couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture {{hanging on the wall}} of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|The film opens <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> an {{abandoned}} office, where {{the main character}} (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which {{is surrounded by a}} desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E

5|$|The video then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> {{the band}} {{playing the game}} before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E
500|$|Before [...] "Sugar & Spice" [...] aired, CBS, fearing sponsor pullouts and viewer backlash, demanded {{revisions}} to the kissing scene. According to Kelley in a Los Angeles Times interview, the network initially suggested fading to black before the second more intimate kiss, then suggested cutting away before the kiss <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> one of Kimberly's brothers eavesdropping. Eventually, the network and Kelley settled on reshooting the kissing scene in darkness. In the episode as aired, a line of dialog is inserted over {{a shot of the}} exterior of the Brock house to explain why the room is suddenly dark.|$|E
500|$|Welles used an aural {{technique}} {{from radio}} called the [...] "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via {{a series of}} related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into {{a young man in}} just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.|$|E
50|$|During a {{speed bump}} task on episode 11 of Season 15 on The Amazing Race, Brian and Ericka had <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> absinthe and drink it before {{receiving}} their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Yet another {{instance}} is a cut,situation blank in an action film when the hero is in <b>a</b> difficult-to-escape situation, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the item {{he will use}} to save himself.|$|R
5000|$|The video then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> final <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the cropfield in night time, {{where there}} is a large crop circle with the words [...] "KoЯn III" [...] present in the middle.|$|R
500|$|The third chorus {{features}} similar footage to {{the first}} two—a singer walking down a set of stairs. The two military leaders are then seen appearing on a game show, each pressing a buzzer which makes {{an image of a}} skull behind them light up. The video cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> a baby sitting between two nuclear missiles before a zoomed out model of the Earth shows multiple mushroom clouds as the planet explodes (this image was used as the front cover for Digipak CD version of the single). The final shot sees the two opposing commanders holding hands and kissing on a tiny piece of the earth as it floats through space while a red heart lights up behind them. The Numero 6 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the DVD version of the [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] single.|$|E
500|$|One antisemitic {{theme that}} is {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the film is the portrayal of Süß as the typical [...] "Jew in disguise", a concept which Welch describes as [...] "the inherent rootlessness of the Jew and his ability to assimilate himself into whichever society he chooses." [...] Süß is presented to the audience first in traditional ghetto attire and then a quick cutaway <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> him in elegant clothes riding in a carriage on his way to Stuttgart. Thus, Süß is shown to be hiding his true identity as a marginalized Jew and posing as a respected member of German society. However, despite Süß's attempts to fit into Württemberg high society, Harlan will not let the audience forget that he is ultimately depicted as a [...] "dirty Jew" [...] and underlines this point by juxtaposing him with the elderly Rabbi Löw. In an interview with Der Film, a German film magazine, Harlan explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Released on Monday, February 28, 2011, {{the video}} {{begins with a}} brief shot of a unicorn's {{silhouette}} in a steam-filled alley, inside a pink triangle frame. The triangle transitions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, inspired by Janus, the Roman god of transition and beginnings, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. As Bernard Herrmann's prelude to the movie Vertigo plays, Gaga {{tells the story of}} the creation of an extraterrestrial race that [...] "bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom." [...] Gaga sits in the throne, giving birth to a [...] "new race within the race of humanity." [...] She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, [...] "How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?" ...|$|E
50|$|Corbucci lets Clay {{reach the}} horizon, then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> medium <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Clay {{taking off his}} glasses, {{throwing}} them in the air, and shooting holes in both lenses. His sight, miraculously, has been completely restored.|$|R
5000|$|... 127 Hours: the zoom-up scene {{which begins}} with <b>a</b> tight <b>shot</b> on Aron (James Franco) {{as he is}} {{screaming}} and pulls out <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large land area, showing how isolated he was from other humans.|$|R

500|$|Although Treehouse of Horror episodes are Halloween-themed, {{for several}} years new episodes premiered in November {{following}} the holiday, due to Fox's coverage of Major League Baseball's World Series. Season 12's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XI" [...] was the first episode to air in November. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIV" [...] where Kang looks at a TV Guide and says, [...] "Pathetic humans. They're showing a Halloween episode... in November!" [...] and Kodos replies [...] "Who's still thinking about Halloween? We've already got our Christmas decoration up." [...] The camera then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the fireplace with Christmas decorations, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits. Season 21's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XX" [...] aired October 18, before the World Series, but the following year's episode, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXI", aired in November. Season 23's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII aired on October 30, however, as the World Series (which went the maximum of seven games) had concluded on October 28. Subsequent Treehouse of Horror episodes have premiered {{in the month of}} October.|$|E
2500|$|The title {{takes on}} yet another level of meaning {{a quarter of the}} way through the film, when Hanns Eisler's {{chilling}} score that has accompanied images of deportation is disrupted, as the train arrives at Auschwitz. The narrator observes that during the train ride [...] "death makes its first choice" [...] and [...] "a second is made upon arrival in the night and fog". The visuals cut <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> trains arriving in night and fog, which has become a metaphor for the mystery of their situation.|$|E
2500|$|A prologue {{introduces}} the episode with a narrative describing the Tudor King Henry VII {{as one of}} history's greatest liars and establishes the show's premise that he rewrote history to suit his own ends. The narrator dispels the popular depiction of King Richard III of England as a scheming murderer; he appears as a villainous hunchback, hobbling towards his young nephews with a dagger, but the dagger is revealed to be a toy and the hunchback is a sack of presents. A close-up {{of one of the}} children fades <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the bearded Richard, Duke of York (Brian Blessed) roaring with laughter, as the narrator declares that he grew up to be [...] "a big, strong boy", and that it was he who was crowned king after winning the Battle of Bosworth, not Henry.|$|E
5000|$|This {{sequence}} {{opens with}} the show's title in yellow approaching the camera through misty cumulus clouds In {{a dark blue}} sky. The shot cuts through the counter in the letter [...] "P" [...] <b>to</b> <b>an</b> establishing <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the town of Springfield.|$|R
50|$|In Berlin, the pickleback is {{available}} in a few of its best bars for several years now. Most notably in Keith where the owner, a Texan, makes his own pickles and uses the juice <b>to</b> back <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Bulleit Bourbon. Geist im Glas, another Berlin bar, does a pickleback using the brine from house made pickled onions.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} only the band. Cameras {{revolve around the}} band playing their parts in a rehearsal setting. When the horn part is prominent, it cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the band - wearing hats, sunglasses, and jackets to conceal their identity - playing the trumpet, saxophone and trombone.|$|R
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Moss's widow {{returns home}} to find Chigurh inside, waiting for her. After hearing her pleas for mercy, he {{partially}} relents by relying on his coin toss. In the book, she calls heads; it comes up tails, and he shoots and kills her. In the film adaptation, she refuses to call the toss, saying [...] "The coin don't have no say. [...] It's just you." [...] The movie then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Chigurh leaving the house, checking the soles of his boots, implying that he has killed her. [...] While driving away from her house some three blocks away, Chigurh is badly injured in a car accident, sustaining a compound fracture of his left ulna and walking away with a limp. At the collision scene, before the authorities arrive, he offers $100 to a teenager on a bicycle to give him his shirt, seeking to use it to bind up his wounds himself. Chigurh then flees the scene before the ambulance arrives.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{stated that}} the {{decision}} [...] "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington – while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates". Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, [...] "this ruling strikes at our democracy itself" [...] and [...] "I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest". On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, [...] "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities." [...] On television, the camera shifted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the SCOTUS judges {{in the front row}} {{directly in front of the}} President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his head side to side while mouthing the words [...] "Not true".|$|E
5000|$|The {{scene where}} couples are shown {{walking into the}} Sombrero Club on New Year's Eve 1969 is similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> people {{entering}} a party from Welles' film The Magnificent Ambersons.|$|E
50|$|The scene then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wider <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Hell, showing Pinhead {{standing}} on a platform, surrounded by an even larger sea <b>of</b> bodies. The <b>shot</b> flickers in and out, each time zooming further out and finally fading to Hellraiser: Origins and showing the web address for the projects page.|$|R
5000|$|The main camera then tracks forward <b>to</b> <b>a</b> final <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Orlando in <b>a</b> {{lifeboat}} {{with the}} rhinoceros happily munching on hay. [...] "Did you know," [...] confides Orlando, [...] "that a rhinoceros gives very good milk?" [...] Laughing, he once again mans the oars <b>to</b> disappear on <b>a</b> vast plastic ocean.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} Russian Roulette called “Hillbilly Roulette,” which {{involves}} loading a gun with three chambers, and aiming {{as close as}} possible to another person’s head without hitting, and requires the person firing the gun <b>to</b> drink <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> 80 proof or stronger libation (usually whiskey or moonshine) before each round of play, is referenced extensively in the 2016 novel Nobody's Property.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{example is}} a man walking up to a door and {{reaching}} for the knob. Just as his hand touches the knob, the scene cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> the door opening from the other side.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{concludes with}} Jose and Maria reminiscing about their past as Jose says [...] "God {{has been good}} to us, we've been very lucky, and our life it has been very...very good" [...] and the camera pans <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|Red espresso (stylised as red espresso) is {{the brand}} name of The Red Espresso Company Pty Ltd, a South African {{manufacturer}} of Rooibos tea products.

500|$|Not all {{reaction}} to the airing was negative: [...] On an episode of the variety series Cher that aired shortly afterward and featured Stevenson as a guest, the situation was parodied when the episode opened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> studio <b>shot</b> <b>of</b> Stevenson as Blake floating on a smoking raft and shouting, [...] "I'm OK!
