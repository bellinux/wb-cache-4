Under the stewardship of Warren Buffett and Joseph Rosenfield, the college adopted an opportunistic strategy in managing its assets.

25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into <b>the</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E
25|$|Start-ups need {{venture capital}} to thrive. Between 2004 and 2013, <b>the</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> {{industry}} played a fundamental {{role in the}} development of Israel’s high-tech sector, including by financing start-ups. By 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country. Israel's venture capital market attracted US$2 346 million alone in 2013. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest centres for venture capital in the world outside the USA. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world’s largest multinational companies, including Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle Siemens and Samsung. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.|$|E
