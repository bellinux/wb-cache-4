50|$|Pristimantis ridens {{are small}} frogs, with males growing to 19 mm and females to 25 mm in snout-vent length. The dorsal skin {{is smooth and}} pale brown or yellow in colour, with some pink undertones. There is often a {{slightly}} darker W-shaped patch just behind the head. Individuals may have a single or two, parallel dorsolateral stripes. The <b>thighs</b> are <b>barred.</b> The ventral colouration is yellow with some dark specks.|$|R
50|$|It is 30-36 cm in length, {{with the}} female larger than the male. Adult has {{prominent}} black wing tips. The male is grey above, white below and has red eyes. Female has rufous on breast and underwing coverts, and yellow eyes. Juvenile has grey face, brown upperparts and yellow eyes. The top underparts are streaked, while the <b>thighs</b> are <b>barred.</b> The black wing tips are not as prominent and underwings streaked (except for coverts).|$|R
50|$|The five {{adult males}} in the type series measure 52 - 66 mm in snout-vent length. The {{colouration}} is green with darker green, irregular blotches. These blotches become nearly diagonal laterally. The fore- and hindlimbs have subcircular blotches; the <b>thighs</b> have three <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hyloxalus chocoensis {{measure up}} to 28 mm in snout-vent length. Dorsum is gray in preservative. A light dorsolateral line extends from the eye along the upper {{side of the body}} to the rear, where it nearly meet the line from the other side. <b>Thighs</b> are lightly <b>barred.</b> The lip line is white.|$|R
5000|$|The drop kip is a kip {{often used}} in {{gymnastics}} conditioning, both to strengthen the muscles of those who already are able to perform a kip {{as well as to}} help new students learn a kip. This kip utilizes little swing, rather, it requires a great deal of strength {{on the part of the}} gymnast. The gymnast begins in a front support on the <b>bar,</b> <b>thighs</b> on the <b>bar,</b> chest in hollow. He or she then drops backwards with straight arms, [...] "sliding" [...] the bar down his or her legs to his or her feet. His or her shins or feet must stay close to the bar. After completing his or her small swing backwards he or she begins the kipping action by pushing down with straight arms to arrive again in a hollow front support on the bar.|$|R
5000|$|Males {{measure up}} to 56 mm and females to 59 mm in snout-vent length. They have a distinct, triangular-shaped [...] "helmet" [...] on the head. Colour is light brown (sometimes {{yellowish}} or greyish) dorsally, possibly with some darker markings. The <b>thighs</b> are often <b>barred.</b> The ventral surface is brown, becoming darker on the throat and chest.|$|R
50|$|The {{white-banded swallow}} is a {{medium-sized}} swallow, measuring, on average, 15 cm and weighing 12 - 16 g. They {{usually have a}} wingspan of 92 - 108 mm. They decline in size from north to south, {{but this is a}} gradual decline, which suggests that there is no geographical variation. It is black, except for the band on its breast, its <b>thighs,</b> and <b>bars</b> on the edge of its wings, which are all white. It also has blackish-brown underwing coverts. Their feathers have a blue-black luster. This swallow has a deeply forked tail. The sexes are similar, although the females weigh slightly more on average (12 - 14 g for the males, 12.8 - 15.8 g for the females). The juveniles are noted to be duller and browner, with shorter and paler feathers.|$|R
50|$|Incilius melanochlorus are {{moderately}} large toads, with males {{growing to}} 65 mm and females 103 mm in snout-vent length. The dorsal coloration is light brown, often with lighter brown bands toward the sides. There is a thin, light mid-dorsal stripe. In females, the dorsum has darker brown mottling. The sides are dark and bordered above by {{a row of}} light-colored warts. The upper surfaces of the <b>thighs</b> have dark <b>bars.</b> The dorsum is very warty and the cranial crests are well-developed, whereas the paratoid glands are small and triangular. The ventral surface is yellowish. Males have a vocal sac with a greenish cast.|$|R
500|$|This hawk is a medium-sized, slender {{species with}} short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is [...] long, with the tail {{contributing}} [...] The wingspan is [...] across. The adult of the nominate subspecies, Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis, has a blackish-brown crown and upper neck while {{the sides of}} the neck and a broad collar are a dark rufous-brown. The feathers {{on the top of the}} head are slightly pointed, giving this species a hint of a crest. The remaining upperparts are a dark chocolate brown. The cheeks are light brown while the throat is buffy white with streaks. The eyes are large and dark brown or grey in females and yellow in males while the beak is short but deep. It also has a black median streak. The bird's underparts are white with variable amounts of rufous wash and a number of large, round blackish spots. The serpent eagle's <b>thighs</b> are <b>barred</b> sepia-brown and white, while the undertail is white. The underwing is largely white with some black spots and brown coloration. The tail is light brown, with five to six broad black bars. The claws are short and sharp, while the legs are yellow. Sexes are similar, though the female averages about three percent larger than the male. Immatures have a white crown and mantle, while the upper back has rounded brown or black spots that vanish as the bird ages. The wings and tail are greyish-brown and paler than those of the adults and are more darkly barred.|$|R

25|$|A. (s.) ventralis (plain-breasted hawk): Polymorphic. The {{most common}} morph has dark grey upperparts (often appears almost black) and white underparts variably barred, shaded, or mottled with rufous or tawny-buff (extensively marked {{individuals}} may appear almost entirely rufous or tawny-buff below). Occasionally, the barring {{to the lower}} belly and flanks may appear duskier. The white morph has bluish-grey upperparts (similar to the nominate group), but its underparts are all white except for its rufous thighs. The rare dark morph, the only morph which sometimes lacks rufous thighs, is entirely sooty (occasionally with slight white barring to belly and faint grey bands in tail). The underparts of the females average paler than males of the same morph. The iris is typically yellow (contra illustrations in some books), but individuals (mainly sub-adults?) with a darker iris are occasionally seen. Juveniles have dark brownish or dusky upperparts with each feather typically edged rufous, giving a rather scaly appearance. The underparts are white streaked brown, and the <b>thighs</b> are rufous <b>barred</b> white. Occasionally, juveniles with underparts extensively rufous streaked blackish are seen.|$|R
50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} {{are sometimes}} mistaken for species even {{outside of the}} Accipiter genus especially as juveniles of each respective species. In North America, four species of buteonine hawk (all four of which are smaller than goshawks to a certain degree) may be confused with them on occasion despite the differing proportions of these hawks, which all have longer wings and shorter tails relative to their size. A species so similar it is sometimes nicknamed the “Mexican goshawk”, gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus) juveniles (overlapping with true goshawks in the southwest United States into Mexico) have contrasting face pattern with bold dusky eye-stripes, dark eyes, <b>barred</b> <b>thighs</b> and a bold white “U” on the uppertail coverts. The roadside hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) (rarely in same range in Mexico) is noticeably smaller with paddle shaped wings, barred lower breast and a buff “U” on undertail coverts in young birds. Somewhat less likely to confused despite their broader extent of overlap are the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) which have a narrow white-barred, dark-looking tail, bold white crescents on their primaries and dark wing edges and the broad-winged hawk (Buteo playpterus) which also has dark wing edges and a differing tapered wing shape. Even wintering gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) juveniles have been mistaken for goshawks and vice versa on occasion, especially when observed distantly perched, but have many tell-tale falcon characteristics like pointed, longer wings, a brown malar stripe {{as well as its}} more extensive barring both above and below.|$|R
50|$|The Moravia High Jump Tour on 29 January saw him {{start the}} 2011 indoor season in strong form, opening - as he usually does - at 2.20 and {{progressing}} to eventually clear 2.38 m (7 ft 9 1/2 in) {{on his second}} try, and then came close {{in an attempt to}} break Javier Sotomayor's world indoor mark of 2.43. With Sotomayor standing behind him watching, Ukhov first two attempts at 2.44 (8 ft) were excellent, accelerating through his 11-step approach and getting his hips over cleanly before the back of his <b>thighs</b> brushed the <b>bar</b> on the way down, barely bouncing the bar off. On 3 February, he won the Moscow High Jump with Music Cup for the fourth time in his career, with a jump of 2.30, outjumping four other Russian competitors who could manage no higher than 2.27. He repeated his 2.38 performance on 9 February at the Europa SC High Jump meeting in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia. He cleared every height on his first attempt through 2.38, then again had the bar set at 2.44 (8 feet). Ukhov's attempts at the would-be world (indoor) record height were said to be even closer than his previous efforts two weeks earlier in Hustopece. Uhkov skipped the 2011 Russian Indoor Championships (held in Moscow on 16-18 February), in order to compete in the special Hochsprung mit Musik competition in Arnstadt, Germany, on 19 February, which he won with a jump of 2.34 (three cm better than second-place).|$|R
