25|$|Similarly with {{developmental}} dyslexia, {{there has been}} considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect {{can be hard to}} unravel. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why experts such as Moore have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} {{thickness of}} electrolytic capacitors is very slight, {{in the range}} of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficient high dielectric strength the electrolytic capacitors can already achieve a high volumetric capacitance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.|$|E
25|$|A {{firewall}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} outgoing connections made by connect-back shellcode as well as incoming connections made by bindshells. They can therefore offer some protection against an attacker, even if the system is vulnerable, by preventing the attacker from connecting to the shell created by the shellcode. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why socket re-using shellcode is sometimes used: it does not create new connections and therefore is harder to detect and block.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Frøland married Jorunn Ragnhild Bye, {{and they}} {{divorced}} in 1984. Frøland had one son, Ebbe, {{who died on}} 1 January 2002. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he retired from public life.|$|R
5000|$|Maintenance : Especially for steam {{locomotives}} {{but also}} for other types, maintenance facilities can be very dirty environments and it is advantageous {{not to have to}} take passenger accommodation into the same depot. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the demise of the GWR steam railmotors.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Chadwick, one of {{the writers}} of the 1832 Royal Commission hoped to become Commissioner but instead only got the post of Secretary. This caused clashes with the Poor Law Commissioners. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> the Poor Law Commission was {{eventually}} abolishedthere was too much infighting within the organisation.|$|R
25|$|Europeans are {{concerned}} about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of antisemitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said {{that the issue of}} European antisemitism was more important than many economic, financial, and market issues facing Europe.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{organizations}} and institutions, most Mexican artisans are impoverished with little access to quality materials or designs, {{because of lack}} of cultural knowledge. Artisans also must compete with goods manufactured in large factories and copies of Mexican artesania imported from places like China. This keeps prices down, and {{the time it takes to}} make authentic artesanía puts the Mexican craftsmen at an economic disadvantage. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why younger generations have less interest in the craft tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{trends are}} illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs {{also depends on}} other factors {{including}} interactions with Mg2+, B(OH)4− and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects. Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, {{where there is a}} high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that some pool operators prefer borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.|$|E
50|$|Particularly in Upper Canada, {{ordinary}} Militia contingents {{could not}} be kept {{in the field for}} long, especially around harvest time or the planting season when many militia would want to return to work on their farms. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the formation of some of the full-time units.|$|R
5000|$|Godfrey is gay, {{and claimed}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he <b>was</b> fired from BJH. “It was the band’s girlfriends who forced the issue,” he told Classic Rock magazine. ‘‘They {{were from the}} Lancashire/Yorkshire area and couldn’t handle {{the idea of a}} gay man like me with a plummy accent.’’ ...|$|R
60|$|Dan Baxter felt {{particularly}} downcast and desperate. Since {{the capture}} of Lew Flapp, he had been without a companion in whom to confide, and the peculiar loneliness among utter strangers was beginning to tell on him. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he had told Sack Todd {{so much of his}} story.|$|R
25|$|For any finitely {{presented}} group {{it is easy}} {{to construct}} a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm to tell whether two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (even if one is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to tell if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> {{for girls}} leaving {{secondary}} school or missing classes. No privacy {{and lack of}} water supply means that girls prefer {{to stay at home}} during menstruation. Girls may lack knowledge of menstrual hygiene since the subject is taboo. An intervention in four districts of Southern Ethiopia, identified and tested local material for making sanitary pads, trained local tailors to make and mass-produce them, established local supply outlets and lobbied stakeholders to up-scale. Successful testing and raising awareness of the problem resulted in improved facilities for girls in five primary schools and one secondary school.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High intakes of zinc can {{significantly}} decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, reminding {{us of the}} fact that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised. Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.|$|E
50|$|In most Czech {{cities and}} in some others such as Bratislava, Moscow, Riga and Odessa, Tatra-T3 trams became very common. As a result, service and {{maintenance}} workers became very experienced working on them. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for modifying existing trams rather than replacing them with newer stock (the other being cost).|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} the Scottish {{representation}} was manipulated by Henry Dundas, the Scottish {{agent of the}} Tory party, who spent government funds liberally ensuring that Tories <b>were</b> elected. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why the Scottish members were unpopular at Westminster, being regarded as corrupt even {{by the standards of}} the day, as well as uncouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{acid gas}} emitted by the Leblanc Process was a {{considerable}} nuisance. The first successful user of the process, James Muspratt in Liverpool, was forced from Everton due to complaints by neighbours. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why the early alkali makers {{set up in}} then remote spots such as Widnes, which they thought would be distant from litigious neighbours.|$|R
25|$|The NTP packet {{includes}} a leap second flag, which informs the user that a leap second is imminent. This, among other things, allows {{the user to}} distinguish between a bad measurement that should be ignored and a genuine leap second that should be followed. It {{has been reported that}} never, since the monitoring began in 2008 and whether or not a leap second should be inserted, have all NTP servers correctly set their flags on a December 31 or June 30. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> many NTP servers broadcast the wrong time for up to a day after a leap second insertion, and {{it has been suggested that}} hackers have exploited this vulnerability.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> {{that the}} {{probability}} of transmitting many infections is far higher from sex than by more casual means of transmission, such as non-sexual contact—touching, hugging, shaking hands—but {{it is not the}} only reason. Although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals, many STIs seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing. According to a safe sex chart, many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another. With HIV, genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva. Some infections labeled as STIs can be transmitted by direct skin contact. Herpes simplex and HPV are both examples. KSHV, on the other hand, may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used as a sexual lubricant.|$|E
50|$|Both these {{incidents}} are quite believable. Most poisons {{of the period}} were strong alkaloids which would cause cow-horn drinking cups to fray. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for their use. When Egill carved the rune, in all likelihood he had spotted the fraying (which {{he would have been}} looking for) and used it to disguise why he pried at the cup.|$|R
5000|$|Relationship {{of early}} {{time-sharing}} to introduction of HP-35: Before {{the availability of}} powerful handheld calculators in 1972, during the [...] "first decade of time-sharing, one use for a terminal was to request minor calculations {{that needed to be}} carried to more decimal places than possible with a slide rule." [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> time-sharing <b>was</b> so important to scientific and academic users.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} of the succession <b>was</b> really, at <b>this</b> time, in a very curious state. The Duke of Gloucester himself was Henry's heir in case he should die without children; for Gloucester was Henry's oldest uncle, and, of course, in default of his descendants, the crown {{would go back to}} him. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> perhaps, why he had opposed Henry's marriage.|$|R
25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
500|$|The group 11 metals (or coinage metals), copper, silver, and gold, are {{typically}} categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, {{they have the}} relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post-transition metals. [...] "The filled d subshell and free s electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals {{to the left of}} group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility." [...] Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for their previously being labelled as [...] "group IB", paralleling the alkali metals' [...] "group IA". They are occasionally classified as post-transition metals. Their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals. Their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their salts, like those of the alkali metals.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, [...] "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity." [...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E
50|$|He took {{initiative}} to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> {{in contrast to}} rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why his popularity with masses remained high.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the special}} {{characteristic}} about <b>this</b> supercomputer <b>is</b> the ratio between cores and RAM. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why it received the denomination of [...] "singular technical and scientific installation" [...] from the Spanish government, a denomination given to some installations which have some value that makes them singular in some way. Some of those installations include the Canary Island grand telescope, or the Alba synchrotron.|$|R

2500|$|According to one study, {{the belief}} in magical warfare {{technologies}} (such as [...] "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, {{even if it is}} suboptimal at the individual level. The authors of the study argue that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why {{the belief in}} witchcraft persists.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unfortunate}} {{that the value of}} k in Corollary 1 is {{generally}} much larger than the tree width of H (a notable exception is when H = K4, the complete graph on four vertices, for which k=3). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that the graph structure theorem is said to describe the [...] "rough structure" [...] of H-free graphs.|$|E
60|$|Before {{four o'clock}} came {{the call to}} quarters, and the men ran to their various stations, and {{stripped}} for action, most of them wearing {{little more than an}} undershirt and a pair of trousers. The weather was frightfully hot, and the interior of the cruiser was little better than a bake-oven.

50|$|In April 1996 in Oslo, Jansons {{nearly died}} while {{conducting}} the final pages of La bohème, after a heart attack. He recuperated in Switzerland. Later, surgeons in Pittsburgh fitted a defibrillator {{in his chest}} to give his heart an electric jolt if it fails. (Jansons's father died at a 1984 concert, conducting the Hallé Orchestra). Jansons has stated that he suffers from jet lag, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that he left his American position.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1960, the U.S. {{had never}} had a Catholic president. Many Protestants were afraid that if a Catholic were elected president, he would take orders from the Pope; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Al Smith lost the 1928 election. Decades later another Catholic, John F. Kennedy, spoke to a {{convention}} of Baptist pastors in Texas during his election campaign. He assured them that, if elected, he would put his country before his religion.|$|R
