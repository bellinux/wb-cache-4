Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E

Ambassador Bishop, aware of the ongoing strife, believed [...] "the odds were better than even <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances."

[...] A few hours after his visit, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would not allow US troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult.|$|E

Afterward, the reporters were taken to the set of Parks and Recreation where they were able to greet and pose for photos with the actual miniature horse who played Li'l Sebastian. Shortly after the episode aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC website. It was about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations, including an extended cold open with the parks department meeting Li'l Sebastian, and additional scenes of Leslie meeting with Pawnee constituents before the Harvest Festival.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has always been <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E
