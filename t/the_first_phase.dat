5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>phase,</b> those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
