His Rapidan fishing camp in Virginia, which he had donated to the {{government}} in 1933, is now a National Historic Landmark within the Shenandoah National Park. Hoover and his wife are buried at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa. Hoover was honored with a state funeral, the last of three in a span of 12 months, coming as it did just after the deaths of President John F. Kennedy and General Douglas MacArthur. Former Chaplain of the Senate Frederick Brown Harris officiated. All three had <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> common: the commanding general of the Military District of Washington during those funerals was Army Major General Philip C. Wehle and the riderless horse was Black Jack, who also served in that role during Lyndon B. Johnson's funeral.|$|E

2500|$|Iorga's {{contributions}} for Sămănătorul occasionally {{stood as}} manifestations of his antisemitism, {{as was the}} case with a November 1904 article. The text was structured around the allegation that Iași city had been taken over by the non-emancipated Jews and the policies of Zionism: [...] "Iaşi is three-quarter Jewish. They own its wealth, its life, its activity. The flame of Zionism was lit and burns more brightly over there. We [...] only have <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> Iaşi: the school and the church. And the King of Romania arrives into [...] persecuted by the filthy business-minded existence of another nation.

When a CBC interviewer asked Clement to specify the measures the RCMP must take to do so, he refused to answer. Clement later clarified [...] "We are calling for <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> particular.

2500|$|Povenmire and Marsh both wrote [...] "Rollercoaster", {{and used}} it as the pitch for the entire series. Unlike normal series, they did not send a script to the {{overseas}} Disney executives, but set up a storyboard and mixed it over with dialogue by Povenmire, then set up a [...] "play-by-play" [...] and recorded it. The series was accepted after 16 years of development and the episode was produced. Several lines and scenes from the storyboard were removed or altered in the eventual production of the episode. Several such scenes were eventually used in later episodes, such as a scene later used in the episode [...] "Gaming the System", in which Doofenshmirtz waits a few seconds, until precisely 11:00, before initiating his plan. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to include <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> every episode; a song, and an action or chase scene. However, the song in every episode did not begin until Flop Starz, the next episode.|$|E
2500|$|Jerry Goldsmith {{has often}} been {{considered}} one of film music history's most innovative and influential composers. [...] While presenting Goldsmith with a Career Achievement Award from the Society for the Preservation of Film Music in 1993, fellow composer Henry Mancini (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Pink Panther) said of Goldsmith, [...] "...he has instilled <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> his colleagues in this town. [...] One thing he does, he keeps us honest. [...] And the second one is he scares {{the hell out of}} us." [...] In his review of the 1999 re-issue of the [...] soundtrack, Bruce Eder highly praised Goldsmith's ability, stating, [...] "...one of the new tracks, 'Spock's Arrival,' may be the closest that Goldsmith has ever come to writing serious music in a pure Romantic idiom; this could have been the work of Rimsky-Korsakov or Stravinsky — it's that good." [...] In a 2001 interview, film composer Marco Beltrami ( [...] , The Hurt Locker) stated, [...] "Without Jerry, film music would probably be in a different place than it is now. I think he, more than any other composer bridged the gap between the old Hollywood scoring style and the [...] modern film composer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{a case of}} corpse {{contamination}} of <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> succession (where one is rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and one being rendered impure with an impurity until the evening) occurs when a person who touches a corpse is rendered impure with a seven-day impurity, as [...] says, [...] "He who touches the corpse of any human being shall be unclean for seven days." [...] The Rabbis considered a corpse to have the highest power to defile, and regarded a corpse as an originating source of impurity, a [...] "father of fathers of impurity" [...] ( [...] , avi avot ha-tumah). Thus the Mishnah taught that a corpse can confer a generating impurity, a [...] "father of impurity" [...] ( [...] , av ha-tumah), on a person with whom it comes in contact. A [...] "father of impurity" [...] ( [...] , av ha-tumah) requires a seven-day cleansing period. And then a second person who touches {{the first person who}} touched the corpse is rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening, as [...] says, [...] "the person who touches him shall be unclean until evening." [...] The [...] "father of impurity" [...] ( [...] , av ha-tumah) — in this case, the person who first touched the corpse — can, in turn, confer a first-grade impurity ( [...] , rishon l'tumah), which requires a cleansing period lasting only until sundown. In sum, in this case, the first person acquired a [...] "father of impurity" [...] ( [...] , av ha-tumah) from the corpse, and the second person acquired a first-grade impurity ( [...] , rishon l'tumah) from the first person.|$|E
