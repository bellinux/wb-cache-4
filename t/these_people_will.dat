25|$|The {{economic}} policy stance currently dominant {{around the world}} uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.|$|E

25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There {{is little evidence}} of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention {{as an alternative to}} diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2007 presidential election, President Lee Myung-bak {{formed a}} {{government}} of mostly close supporters. Park's supporters argued {{that this was a}} kind of political reprisal, and that they should secede from the Grand National Party. Eventually, they formed parties named Pro-Park Coalition and Solidarity for Pro-Park Independents (친박 무소속 연대; Chin Park Musosok Yeondae). Park herself did not join them, but indirectly supported them by announcing [...] "I hope <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> come back alive." [...] After the mass secession, the rebels announced that they would rejoin GNP after the general election, but the GNP prohibited it. In the following 2008 general election, the rebels won 26 seats: 14 from the Pro-Park Coalition and 12 as independents. Together, they played a pivotal role in the GNP's narrow majority. Park continually insisted that GNP should allow the return of her supporters. As of 2011, most of these rebels had returned to the GNP, resulting in approximately 50 to 60 assembly members who support Park out of 171 in the GNP.|$|E

The FN scores well among people living in poverty, who have a real fear about how to make ends meet." [...] Crépon also analysed the increase of the FN vote in [...] "rural" [...] areas and the recent sociological changes in these areas made up of small provincial towns and new housing-estate commuter belts built on the distant outskirts of the cities: [...] "The rural underclass is no longer agricultural. It is people who have fled the big cities and the inner suburbs because they {{can no longer afford to}} live there. Many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> have had recent experience of living in the banlieues (high immigration suburbs) – and have had contact with the problems of insecurity."

2500|$|Russell Barkley {{believes}} labeling is {{a double-edged}} sword; {{there are many}} pitfalls to labeling but by using a precise label, services can be accessed.

Furthermore studies also show that the education of the siblings and parents has at least a short-term impact on the outcome of treatment. Barkley states this about ADHD rights: [...] "... because of various legislation that has been passed to protect them. There are special education laws with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, mentioning ADHD as an eligible condition. If you change the label, and again refer to it as just some variation in normal temperament, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> lose access to these services, and will lose these hard-won protections that keep them from being discriminated against. ..." [...] Psychiatrist Harvey Parker, who founded CHADD, states, [...] "we should be celebrating the fact that school districts across the country are beginning to understand and recognize kids with ADHD, and are finding ways of treating them. We should celebrate the fact that the general public doesn't look at ADHD kids as [...] "bad" [...] kids, as brats, but as kids who have a problem that they can overcome". However, children may be ridiculed at school by their peers for using psychiatric medications including those for ADHD.|$|E
2500|$|Four American Black Hawk {{helicopters}} (other {{sources say}} 2 Black Hawk helicopters, who were escorted by 2 AH-6 little bird helicopters) entered Syrian airspace around 16:45 local time on October 26 and deployed roughly two dozen soldiers, who attacked a {{building under construction}} {{in the village of}} As Sukkariyah, just north of Abu Kamal. Sky News reported that two of the four American helicopters landed, allowing 10 US Army Special Forces (other sources say they were Delta Force) soldiers to disembark and storm a building under construction. The Syrian government stated that the soldiers killed eight civilians, including a man, his four children, and a married couple. However, reporters said they only saw seven bodies, and no children. [...] U.S. officials contended that all those killed during the raid were associated with Abu Ghadiya, the operation's target. [...] A villager from the area stated that at least two men were seized by the American forces. An eyewitness told the BBC that two of the dead— the married couple— were [...] "very simple people" [...] who [...] "lived in a tent and were being paid to guard building materials such as cement and timber, 24 hours a day. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> have {{had nothing to do with}} the insurgency in Iraq."

2500|$|Goal {{congruence}} {{also plays}} a role in influencing the relationship between one's core self-evaluations and the satisfaction one has with one's job. The theory behind goal congruence argues that people who choose self-concordant (i.e., congruent) goals will be happier with the goals they pursue, be more likely to put in effort towards achieving these goals, and, consequently, {{will be more likely to}} attain their goals. Self-concordant goals include goals that focus on intrinsic factors. [...] For example, a person pursuing a self-concordant goal will choose a goal that they feel is personally important, and that they will enjoy. On the other hand, goals that are non-self-concordant will focus on more external factors. [...] A person who chooses a non-self-concordant goal will focus on avoiding negative emotions (e.g., anxiety or guilt), satisfying someone else's wishes, or on external rewards, like money. [...] Judge, Bono, Erez, and Locke (2005) found that goal congruence, or choosing self-concordant goals, partially mediates the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] The authors explain that individuals with positive self-regard (i.e. high core self-evaluations) believe themselves to be capable and competent and will be less likely to be affected by external factors; thus, they will be more likely to choose self-concordant goals, which will lead to higher satisfaction. [...] On the other hand, individuals with negative self- regard will be susceptible to external factors like anxiety and guilt. [...] <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> be more likely to pursue non-self-concordant goals and will report lower job satisfaction.|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the unusually frank {{tone of the}} report, Hassan Abdi Madar states:"The report is addressed to the President of the SDR, the Minister of Defence, and Minister of Interior. The latter, Mjor-General Ahmed Suleiman Abdalla is also a son-in-law of the President, and Third Deputy Prime Minister. Since President Barre is also the Minister of Defence -- the previous holder of that portfolio, General Mohammad Ali Samatar, having been promoted Prime Minister on January 30, 1987 -- the report is seemingly confined to family members. This would explain its extreme frankness in specifying certain clans as targets for implemented and recommended punitive action." [...] Other aims of the policy included arming other clans {{in the region and}} encouraging them to fight the dominant Isaaq: [...] "Since it has become evident that the Isaaq were, by act and intent, with the SNM; and since we could not see them giving up the line they have pursued so deceptively for some time; and in order to forestall them; we arranged for the other inhabitants of the North continuous meetings and a mobilization campaign designed to rouse them to action and to raise their level of awareness. [...] This was intended to strengthen their unity and to surround Somali unity with a defensive wall. [...] Among those inhabitants are: the Awdal people, the various sections of Western Somalis , the Las Qorey people, and the Daami people, etc. There {{is no doubt that the}} unity of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> restore the balance of the scales which are now tipped in favour of the Isaaq.

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
