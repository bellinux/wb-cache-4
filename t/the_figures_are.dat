5|$|All <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> {{adorned with}} carved {{ornaments}} {{and surrounded by}} borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in {{the back wall of}} the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Although most of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of}} his assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, {{a young man and}} a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. <b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. In his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E

5000|$|On {{terrestrial}} {{planets and}} other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, {{the distance to}} the horizon for a [...] "standard observer" [...] varies as the square root of the planet's radius. Thus, the horizon on Mercury is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on Mars <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> 73%, on <b>the</b> Moon <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> 52%, on Mimas <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> 18%, and so on.|$|R
50|$|According to some, <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> {{supposed}} to represent Brutus, holding the severed heads {{of his two}} sons, while others claim that instead it is {{the portrait of a}} sculptor. Other still believe <b>the</b> prominent <b>figure</b> to <b>be</b> that of Julius Caesar, while many simply claim that <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> an unknown Roman senator.|$|R
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. <b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, {{the best known}} of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E

5000|$|A study {{analysed}} voting {{records of}} the Fifth European Parliament and ranked groups, concluding: [...] "Towards the top of <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> more pro-European parties (PES, EPP-ED, and ALDE), whereas towards the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> more anti-European parties (EUL/NGL, G/EFA, UEN and EDD)." ...|$|R
5|$|The 1430s dating is {{supported}} by the style of the underdrawing, which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s {{with the exception of one}} of the possible donors, tentatively identified as Margaret of Bavaria, who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. <b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{construction}} of the church can be inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost {{of construction}} or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> updated using data from 2010, the latest year for which data is available.|$|E

5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} {{numbering}} the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme {{in the light of}} recent discoveries. The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in Roman and figures in Arabic numerals, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.|$|E

5|$|According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Hispanics were {{recipients}} of every major U.S. military decoration during World War II; {{they have also}} been honored with military awards from other countries. Thirty-one Hispanic-Americans were awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre and three Hispanic-Americans received the French Croix de guerre. The figures in the following table were derived from the book Undaunted Courage Mexican American Patriots Of World War II published in 2005 by Latino Advocates for Education, Inc. and according to Rogelio C. Rodriguez of the LAE, <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> based on listings of military service personnel that have been compiled from military records, historical documentation, or personal accounts.|$|E

5|$|Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin {{is a large}} oil and tempera on oak panel painting, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, {{attributed}} to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. <b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{on the number of}} Bosnian Croat and HV casualties. Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed. The Bosnian Serbs and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war. The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops. <b>The</b> <b>figures</b> <b>are</b> reported to include 19 civilian deaths on each side. Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground, the information proved to be incorrect—the settlements sustained relatively minor damage. Conversely, Croat- or Bosniak-inhabited villages were looted and torched. Zlosela suffered extensive damage—the village school was the only structure with a roof left in place.|$|E
