25|$|Like {{neighboring}} Suffolk County, Nassau County residents primarily {{supported the}} Republican Party in national elections until the 1990s. That decade, {{it began to}} shift toward the Democratic Party. Democrat Bill Clinton carried the county in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996. Later Nassau voters gave a large margin of victory <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> in 2000 (19.4%), but John Kerry's winning margin in 2004 was considerably slimmer (5.6%). In that election, Kerry won the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead, but lost the Town of Oyster Bay.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party holds a {{plurality}} of registrations in Delaware. Until the 2000 presidential election, the state tended to be a Presidential bellwether, sending its three electoral votes to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore.</b> In 2004 John Kerry won Delaware by eight percentage points. In 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Delaware 62.63% to 37.37%. Obama's running mate was Joe Biden, who had represented Delaware in the United States Senate since 1973. Obama carried Delaware again in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E

500|$|Eve is {{recognized}} as [...] "a leader on just about every issue that's important to families", according <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> and for his services to the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, {{as well as to}} the committee of public officials who attempted to resolve the conflict at the Attica State Prison. [...] Eve's major emphasis is on those at the very bottom of society; he believes that a nation should be judged by how it attends to the needs of its lowest citizens—the homeless, the chronically poor, and the working poor, among whom blacks are numbered disproportionately.|$|E
500|$|Trump officially {{released}} his book The America We Deserve on January 1. Dave Shiflett received credit as co-writer. To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions from reporters, once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating soft money contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to give your life savings <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America We Deserve also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] It criticizes Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley as a [...] "phony" [...] for his Senate sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly hurt Trump financially. [...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book." [...] Dave Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as autobiographical and reported that it contains [...] "enough details to paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump presidency might look like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{according}} to sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election {{might have gone}} <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law disenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain suffrage. In their 2002 American Sociological Review article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election. Matt Ford noted their study concluded [...] "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted {{at the same rate}} as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes." [...] The effect of Florida's law is such that in 2014 [...] "ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four African-American Floridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions." ...|$|E

2500|$|After losing New Mexico <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> in 2000 by just 366 votes, President Bush's reelection set its {{sights on}} {{claiming}} {{the only state}} that borders Texas not to go for President Bush in 2000. [...] To that end, the campaign dispatched Jennings to manage its operations. [...] Jennings arrived in early 2004 to find a divided state Republican Party. [...] Shortly after his arrival, the state party chairman, State Senator Ramsay Gorham, resigned both her chairmanship and legislative seat and {{moved out of the}} state. [...] Jennings and Republican Party counterpart Jay McCleskey set about repairing the damaged party, trying to focus activists on the campaign at hand rather than the factionalism. [...] The two worked together to recruit fifteen-thousand volunteers who operated phone banks, went door to door, and executed a grassroots strategy that relied heavily on peer-to-peer, coalition-based activity. [...] The Democratic establishment spent millions of dollars in the state through the Kerry for President Campaign, the state Democratic Party, and through a host of third-party organizations such as American Coming Together and Moveon.org. [...] The Democrats relied primarily on paid workers; the Bush Campaign and Republican Party utilized mostly volunteer manpower. [...] Bush won the New Mexico election by 5,988 votes, {{making it one of the}} closest states in the nation. [...] Along with only Iowa, New Mexico flipped from Democrat to Republican between 2000 and 2004.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing <b>to</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E
