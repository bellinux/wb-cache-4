Two <b>test-pieces</b> were hydrogenated simultaneously, then one was tensioned by a tensile machine, while the other was tested by a hydrogen analyzer. Tensile tests results have shown that as the charging time increases, the material toughness (obtained by the value of reduction in area) decreases, passes through a minimum value and then later tends to recover its original value. Hydrogen-analyzer results have highlighted that, in parallel with the decrease and the recovery in material toughness, there is an increase {{and a decrease in}} the amount of hydrogen extractable at 400 °C, respectively, while at 600 °C and 800 °C respectively, it remains practically constant and subsequently increases.

40|$|Compared to manual Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for {{inspection}} of engineering components, automated robotic {{deployment of the}} same NDT techniques offers an increase in accuracy, precision and speed of inspection while reducing production time and associated labour costs. Traditionally, the robot tool path is either taught or programmed manually. Automation of NDT tool path generation, as presented in this paper, offers further significant time reduction, {{and an increase in}} the flexibility of inspection planning compared to manual robot teaching and programming. Moreover, such a solution helps to maintain a controlled probe orientation with respect to the scanned surface, and thus which can dramatically reducing lift-off noise.

40|$|Laser {{consolidation}} (LC) {{is a novel}} {{computer-aided manufacturing}} process being developed by the Industrial Materials Institute of National Research Council of Canada (NRC-IMI). This rapid manufacturing process produces net-shape functional metallic parts layer-by-layer directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) model by using a laser beam to melt the injected powder and resolidifying it on the substrate or previous layer. As {{an alternative to the}} conventional machining process, this novel manufacturing process builds net-shape functional parts or features on an existing part by adding instead of removing materials. In this paper, laser consolidation of various high performance materials (such as Ni-alloys, tool steels, etc.) will be demonstrated to manufacture functional components or <b>test-pieces</b> (such as shell-based mold inserts, impeller, intersected multihexagon tube, goblet shape, etc.) for potential aerospace, automotive, and other applications.

40|$|Weld {{residual}} stress (RS) measurements are often undertaken on <b>test-pieces</b> {{which have been}} cut out from large components, yet it remains unclear {{to what extent the}} RS in testpieces are representative of those present in the original component. Similarly weld mechanical performance tests are frequently undertaken on cross-weld <b>test-pieces</b> without a proper understanding of the level or influence of retained RS. We present a systematic study of the relaxation of longitudinal RS in thin-plate butt welds produced using different materials and welding methods (FSW, Laser-MIG and pulsed MIG). In each case the RS were measured repeatedly in the same location as the welds were progressively and symmetrically cut down. Although cutting inevitably leads to stress redistribution, significant relaxation of the longitudinal RS was only observed when the weld length or width was reduced to below a certain value. This critical value appears to correlate with the lateral width of the tensile zone local to the weld-line and may be considered to be the characteristic length as defined in St. Venantís Principle. Further, {{it was found that the}} level of stress relaxation as a function of weld length for all the welds studied could be collapsed onto a single empirical curve using a simple approach based on the characteristic length scales of the weld. Given the range of materials and welding methods used, this relation appears to be of general use for thin plate welds, although further work is required to test the limits of its applicability...|$|R

50|$|No {{surface is}} ever {{completely}} flat. Therefore, any errors or irregularities that {{exist on the}} optical flat will affect {{the results of the}} test. Optical flats are extremely sensitive to temperature changes, which can cause temporary surface deviations resulting from uneven thermal expansion. The glass often experiences poor thermal conduction, taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium. Merely handling the flats can transfer enough heat to offset the results, so glasses such as fused silica or borosilicate are used, which have very low coefficients of themal expansion. The glass needs to be hard and very stable, and is usually very thick to prevent flexing. When measuring on the nanometer scale, the slightest bit of pressure can cause the glass to flex enough to distort the results. Therefore, a very flat and stable work-surface is also needed, on which the test can be performed, preventing both the flat and the <b>test-piece</b> from sagging under their combined weight, Often, a precision-ground marble or stone block is used as a work surface, providing a steady table-top for testing upon. To provide an even flatter surface, sometimes the test may be performed on top of another optical flat, with the test surface sandwiched in the middle.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} stress state on the nucleation and growth of damage during hot deformation of free cutting steel. A <b>test-piece</b> was designed to emulate stress states {{similar to those found}} in hot rolling. The novelty of the new design is its ability to maintain a constant spatial stress state during deformation, allowing a true correlation of the damage mechanism to the stress triaxiality; previous sample geometries had a large variation in stress during plastic deformation, which made it impossible to relate an observed damage mechanism to a particular stress state using a single sample. Continuum damage equations were calibrated using uniaxial tensile tests and implemented into finite element models of compressive test-pieces. The stress distributions in each <b>test-piece</b> geometry were compared and a single <b>test-piece</b> design was chosen with an optimised triaxial stress distribution. The <b>test-piece</b> was deformed at elevated temperatures, sectioned and the microstructure was evaluated. The combination of stress state and strain computed via finite element analysis was compared to the damage produced across the <b>test-piece</b> section. The predictions of the damage equations were compared to the results of physical tests and used to identify appropriate damage models. The effect of stress state on damage was evaluated, which can be used to update and improve existing material models. The stress triaxiality was found to be the dominant factor for damage around inclusions, with a minimum stress triaxiality required for damage growth to occur...|$|E
