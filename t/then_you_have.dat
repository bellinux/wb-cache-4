25|$|On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an {{official}} statement {{for the band}} saying that the Stooges are no more."The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I. So it would be sort-of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy and the Stooges when there's only one Stooge in the band and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> side guys. That doesn't {{make any sense to}} me."Williamson also added that touring had become boring, and trying to balance the band's career as well as Pop's was a difficult task.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2017, Cyrus stated that she isn't {{a big fan of}} the music video herself. [...] "'Wrecking Ball' -- I'll do it, but I don't love it... It's when you're so stoked about something and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to sing a song that bums you out. And I'll never live down when I licked a sledgehammer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, a soap-bubble party <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> SOMETHING. The over-harbour people swear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a tea-party, but I'm {{willing to}} take your word. And you used this {{tombstone}} as a table." ...|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Baird had {{graduated}} {{within a matter}} of hours from anonymity to dubious icon. [...] One employment agency head who only hired legal household workers said, [...] "You have no idea, the frustration, sitting here, knocking your head against the wall, trying to do what's right. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a Zoë Baird who exposes the fact that everybody else is breaking the law." [...] The phrase [...] "to have a Zoë Baird problem" [...] became rooted in the vocabulary of the American professional and political classes.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about movies is how conventional they are, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|A botched {{pit stop}} at the Singapore Grand Prix had demoted Massa from first {{position}} {{to the back of}} field. With three races remaining in the Championship and a seven-point deficit, Massa remained confident about his title chances: [...] "If you look at what happened to me in Singapore where my gap went from one point to seven so suddenly, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to consider it could easily go the other way as well." [...] Hamilton emphasised the value that a conservative racing strategy could hold for his title chances: ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the video}} was banned on MTV in the United Kingdom, Allen commented {{regarding}} this in an inverview:I got really offended when my single 'Smile' got banned [...] from MTV in the U.K. {{because it had}} the word fuck in it. They said, 'We don't want kids to grow up too quickly.' But <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Paris Hilton and the Pussycat Dolls taking their clothes off and gyrating up against womanizing, asshole men, and that's acceptable. You're thinking your kids are gonna grow up quicker because they heard the word fuck than from thinking they should be shoving their tits in people's faces? ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger apologised for his team’s behaviour: [...] "I feel {{we should}} not have reacted at all. Overall we are sorry for what happened. When you do not behave like you want to, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is good for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E
500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though {{they go to the}} darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} elder woman; [...] "I thought I was right. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{a husband and}} no child. It now looks as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a child and no husband." ...|$|R

500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that [...] "you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to work really, really hard. That's about it." [...] He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that The Beatles' success {{had more to do with}} [...] "the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of The Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010: ...|$|E
500|$|In England, Wenger {{has used}} his {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration. The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market. He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and Emmanuel Eboué, and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Hector Bellerín, amongst other La Masia graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him. Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who disputed it was tantamount to child trafficking. Wenger refuted the analogy and said: [...] "Look at Santa Cruz at Blackburn. Ask him what age he came to Bayern Munich. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an answer for Rummenigge." ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding {{their way out of}} a situation, looking for love, having some struggle within love, or questioning the big things in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to go home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E

Go to one {{of those}} big shops, and buy {{anything}} <b>you</b> like, and <b>have</b> a good meal. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better take the camels across to Azim's camp. I shall not want <b>you</b> <b>then,</b> till evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll have {{to offer}} it to Lisle," [...] she smiled. [...] "But I'll walk with you to the lodge; and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go in and keep quiet until you get back your nerve." ...|$|R

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's {{the kind of music}} that plants a seed in your mind and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Rolling Stone list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" [...] ranked [...] "Highway 61 Revisited", [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] at number373, number187, and numberone, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. It was also included in Robert Christgau's [...] "Basic Record Library" [...] of 1960s music and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all summer {{to figure out how to}} get yourself out of it".|$|E
6000|$|... 'When the {{business}} is regularly before that Department, whatever it is,' pursued this bright young Barnacle, 'then you can watch it {{from time to time}} through that Department. When it comes regularly before this Department, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> must watch it from time to time through this Department. We shall have to refer it right and left; and when we refer it anywhere, then you'll have to look it up. When it comes back to us at any time, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better look US up. When it sticks anywhere, you'll have to try to give it a jog. When you write to another Department about it, and then to this Department about it, and don't hear anything satisfactory about it, why <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better--keep on writing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Robert, a man {{thoroughly}} {{versed in}} arts of improving money, but thoroughly honest, said to me, [...] "Madam, I am glad you {{approve of the}} method that I proposed to you; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> begun wrong; <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> come for your interest at the half-year, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{had the money to}} put out.

500|$|The {{game was}} heavily criticized for {{its lack of}} originality. Daniel Shannon of GameSpot remarked that [...] "If you have played a first-person shooter {{made in the last}} 10 years, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> already {{experienced}} most of what Alien Rage has to offer.", and continued that [...] "You've seen these weapons before, and you've shot these enemies before". Reviewers especially took issue with the lack of creativity in level design, which Destructoid's Jim Sterling called [...] "tedious corridors full of identical, monotonous, brainless combat encounters". Hardcore Gamers Nikola Suprak commented that several of the levels he played through were visually indistinct from one another, before saying that [...] "level after level of redundant action and repetitive encounters ultimately drag the game down". Critics also noted that the game had a number of technical issues. Sterling ran into two situations where glitches would not allow him to progress without restarting the level, while Sam Turner of The Digital Fix experienced dramatic drops in frame rate during gameplay, and crashed to desktop several times.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{doing well}} in his A-level examinations, because of his report from Harrow {{he was unable to}} obtain a place at any university. After working as a {{gardener}} for two years, and a stint as an office worker which he loathed, he discovered that he enjoyed acting and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). During his time there he appeared in numerous theatre productions, including the lead roles of Gregers Werle in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, Marcus Andronicus in Titus Andronicus, and Stephen Daedalus in an adaptation of James Joyce's novel Ulysses. However, he was disappointed to find that he was treated [...] "like a nonce" [...] for being an Old Harrovian. He also made himself more unpopular by being outspoken and taking on roles in his second and third years despite the practice being forbidden by school policy. One of these was his first break into film – the 2001 horror-thriller The Hole. Fox feels that in landing the role his name [...] "probably helped – it's a combination of timing, luck and contacts". Nonetheless, [...] "the name opens some doors, but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to show you can do the job".|$|E
500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
