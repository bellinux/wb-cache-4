The activity of voltage gated ion channel is electrostatic, where all the charges (charged residues and dipolar <b>terminal</b> <b>charges)</b> {{interact with each other}} and with the transmembrane potential. There are evidences that the role of the charged residues dominate the stabilization of the conformation and the gating process of the ion channel, but the role of the terminal dipolar charges are never considered in such analysis.

40|$|Charge {{linearization}} {{techniques have}} been used {{over the years in}} advanced compact models for bulk and double-gate MOSFETs in order to approximate the position along the channel as a quadratic function of the surface potential (or inversion charge densities) so that the <b>terminal</b> <b>charges</b> can be expressed as a compact closed-form function of source and drain end surface potentials (or inversion charge densities). In this paper, in case of the independent double-gate MOSFETs, we show that the same technique could be used to model the <b>terminal</b> <b>charges</b> quite accurately only when the 1 -D Poisson solution along the channel is fully hyperbolic in nature or the effective gate voltages are same. However, for other bias conditions, it leads to significant error in terminal charge computation. We further demonstrate that the amount of nonlinearity that prevails between the surface potentials along the channel actually dictates if the conventional charge linearization technique could be applied for a particular bias condition or not. Taking into account this nonlinearity, we propose a compact charge model, which is based on a novel piecewise linearization technique and shows excellent agreement with numerical and Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations for all bias conditions and also preserves the source/drain symmetry which is essential for Radio Frequency (RF) circuit design.
