50|$|Many {{previous}} {{systems of}} Tibetan transliteration included internal capitalisation schemes—essentially, capitalising the root letter {{rather than the}} first letter of a word, when the first letter is a prefix consonant. Tibetan dictionaries are organized by root letter, and prefixes are often silent, so knowing the root letter gives {{a better idea of}} pronunciation. However, these schemes were often applied inconsistently, and usually only when the word would normally be capitalised according to the norms of Latin text (i.e. {{at the beginning of a}} sentence). On the grounds that internal capitalisation was overly cumbersome, of limited usefulness in determining pronunciation, and probably superfluous to a reader able to use a Tibetan dictionary, Wylie specified that if a word was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised,</b> the first letter should be capital, in conformity with Western capitalisation practices. Thus a particular Tibetan Buddhist sect (Kagyu) is capitalised Bka' brgyud and not bKa' brgyud.|$|E

40|$|With little current public {{information}} on intangible asset capitalisation in the New Zealand environment, this study uses companies {{listed on the}} New Zealand Stock Exchange to determine current practice. The {{purpose of the study}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide a springboard for further research into the intangible area as well as providing an understanding of how New Zealand companies contend with intangible assets, {{in the light of the}} controversy that has surrounded the introduction of the exposure draft, ED- 87 Accounting for Intangible Assets. The study finds that, apart from goodwill, there are a variety of other intangible assets capitalised by New Zealand listed companies and that the majority of these assets are valued at cost. Capitalisation extends across most industry sectors and company size, although a higher proportion of larger than smaller companies capitalise intangible assets. The contribution to asset value made by capitalisation is quite high for some companies, with intangible assets other than goodwill contributing a greater proportion to asset value than goodwill. Although capitalising intangibles reduces the discrepancy between market and book values of equity, capitalising companies still have higher market-to-book ratios than non-capitalising companies, indicating that the market recognises further uncapitalised intangible value. Whilst companies with higher debt levels have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalising</b> companies, there <b>is</b> no evidence <b>to</b> suggest that companies <b>are</b> <b>capitalising</b> simply because of leverage factors. However, with amortisation periods tending to longer rather than shorter time spans (with many companies not amortising at all), companies may well be using amortisation practices to maintain higher asset levels on the balance sheet. The research supports overseas evidence for the value relevance of capitalised intangible assets and also finds that corporate ownership diversity and size can be influential in that value relevance...|$|R

40|$|A {{congestion}} charge {{was introduced in}} the centre of London in February 2003. At the outset, the charge was justified by local policy makers on the basis of an expected reduction in car journeys which would result in improvements in environmental amenity, relating to increased journey speeds across all transport modes, reduced accidents and reduced pollution. In so far as this proved to be the case we would expect the improved environmental amenity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised</b> into increased local residential property values. Simultaneously, vocal 'anti' traffic {{congestion charge}} lobbies suggested that the introduction of such a scheme would be detrimental to local residents in terms of increased motoring costs and the inability of road pricing to deliver expected benefits.

A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised</b> in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws...|$|E
40|$|EDITED VERSION SOON <b>TO</b> <b>BE</b> PUBLISHED In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{decoupling}} on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland are analysed using a dynamic rental equations estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining the extent <b>to</b> which subsidies <b>are</b> <b>capitalised.</b> In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies <b>were</b> highly <b>capitalised</b> into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 58 to 80 cents per euro of subsidies <b>were</b> <b>capitalised</b> into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period {{the rate at which}} Pillar 1 subsidies <b>are</b> <b>capitalised</b> into Irish agricultural rents <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> have declined. This change <b>is</b> likely due <b>to</b> short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate entitlements established on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that <b>is</b> unlikely <b>to</b> have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Our {{paper is}} centred on {{exploring}} {{the experiences of}} opening up closed doors to strangers {{in the context of}} home exchange. Methodology/approach: This paper is based on a year-long research project which has drawn on multiple qualitative methods of data collection. A bricolage approach was adopted to enable the authors to gather data which is sensitive to multivocality and conscious of difference within the consumer experience. Findings: Our findings demonstrate that home exchangers treat their home as an asset <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised,</b> to allow them to travel to places and communities otherwise unreachable. Home exchangers simultaneously engage in the symbolic creation of home in a temporary environment and utilise the kinship and community networks of their home exchange partner. Practical implications: Our paper adds depth and insight to the increasing media coverage of the home exchange phenomenon. Social implications: As a consumption practice that is witnessing widespread appeal, home exchange uncovers evidence of trust amongst strangers. While it is common practice to open the home in order to build friendship, it is less common for this invitation to be extended to strangers. Originality/value of paper: We extend the extensive theorisation of the home as a symbolic environment and reveal that the home can also be used in an enterprising fashion...|$|E
40|$|Homeownership {{rates have}} {{increased}} significantly in many OECD countries over recent decades. Using micro-econometric decomposition techniques, this paper shows {{that part of}} this increase {{can be explained by}} changes in the characteristics of households, including age, household structure, income and education. Nevertheless, {{a significant portion of the}} change in homeownership rates remains unexplained by shifts in household characteristics, leaving a potential role for public policy in explaining developments in homeownership rates. Panel estimates suggest that the relaxation of down-payment constraints on mortgage loans has increased homeownership rates among credit-constrained households over recent decades, resulting in a rise in the aggregate homeownership rate that is comparable with the impact of population ageing. In countries where tax relief on mortgage debt financing is generous, however, the expansionary impact of mortgage market innovations on homeownership is smaller. This is consistent with the tendency for such housing tax relief <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised</b> into real house prices, which may crowd-out some financially constrained households from homeownership at the margin. The impact of housing policies regulating the functioning of the rental market, such as rent regulation and provisions for tenure security, on tenure choice is also explored.

40|$|This paper explores city dweller {{aspirations}} for {{cities of the}} future {{in the context of}} global commitments to radically reduce carbon emissions by 2050; cities contribute the vast majority of these emissions and a growing bulk of theworld's population lives in cities. The particular challenge of creating a carbon reduced future in democratic countries is that the measures proposed must be acceptable to the electorate. Such acceptability is fostered if carbon reduced ways of living are also felt to bewellbeing maximising. Thus the objective of the paper is to explore what kinds of cities people aspire to live in, to ascertain whether these aspirations align with or undermine carbon reduced ways of living, as well as personal wellbeing. Using a novel free associative technique, city aspirations are found to cluster around seven themes, encompassing physical and social aspects. Physically, people aspire to a city with a range of services and facilities, green and blue spaces, efficient transport, beauty and good design. Socially, people aspire to a sense of community and a safe environment. An exploration of these themes reveals that only a minority of the participants' {{aspirations for}} cities relate to lowering carbon or environmental wellbeing. Far more consensual is emphasis on, and a particular vision of, aspirations that will bring personal wellbeing. Furthermore, city dweller aspirations align with evidence concerning factors that maximise personal wellbeing but, far less, with those that produce lowcarbonways of living. In order to shape a lower carbon future that city dwellers accept the potential convergence between environmental and personal wellbeing will need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised</b> on: primarily aversion to pollution and enjoyment of communal green space...|$|E
40|$|Males {{and females}} often have {{divergent}} evolutionary interests, sparking {{two forms of}} sexual conflict: 1) interlocus sexual conflict (IRSC), an antagonistic interaction between the sexes that is mediated by different loci in each sex; 2) intralocus sexual conflict (IASC), where genes have opposite fitness consequences depending on the sex expressing them. Both forms of conflict appear to be common, yet there are large gaps {{in our understanding of}} their evolutionary dynamics. I focus on IASC and begin by synthesising theoretical concepts and empirical findings to better understand its evolutionary dynamics in a critical review of the topic (Chapter 1). I take a multifaceted approach by considering the maintenance, resolution, and consequences of this evolutionary feud. I then explore the extent of sexually antagonistic genetic variation for fitness in a large-scale study of Drosophila melanogaster, using hemiclonal analysis (Chapter 2). I compare results to data collected from the same population five years previously and show that the strength of the conflict has declined over time. Next, I show that subtle changes in temperature during the adult life-stage can dramatically affect sex-specific fitness and alter the direction of the conflict, which could contribute to the maintenance of IASC in natural populations (Chapter 3). I also present a new theoretical model that incorporates IASC into traits that are involved in IRSC arms races (Chapter 4). Surprisingly, IASC can have dramatic and contrasting effects on sexually antagonistic coevolution: stabilising arms races or drawing the sexes into repeated bouts of arms race escalation and stasis. Finally, I extend IASC theory to explore an analogous conflict between castes in social animal societies (Chapter 5) and suggest unique research opportunities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capitalised</b> upon in species with a division of labour. I summarise the work in this thesis by highlighting the broad and varied biological consequences of such a pervasive conflict (Chapter 6) ...|$|E
