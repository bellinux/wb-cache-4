5|$|Roman {{clothing}} styles {{changed over}} time, {{though not as}} rapidly as fashions <b>today.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Dominate, clothing worn by both soldiers and government bureaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embroidered stripes (clavi) and circular roundels (orbiculi) applied to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements consisted of geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures. The use of silk increased, and courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of cultural life based on urban ideals, affected habits of dress: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and the toga was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Silver is very {{important}} in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used <b>today</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E

Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found <b>today</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
