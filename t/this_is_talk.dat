During the two hours' {{market the}} poor beasts, still fastened to their little [...] "chariots," [...] {{rest in the}} open space about the neighbouring Bourse. They snatch at what you throw them; they do not even thank you with a wag of the tail. Gratitude! Politeness! What mean you? We have not heard of such. We only work. Some of them amid all the din lie sleeping between their shafts. Some are licking one another's sores. One would they were better treated; alas! their owners, likewise, are overworked and underfed, housed in kennels no better. But if the majority in every society were not overworked and underfed and meanly housed, why, then the minority could not be underworked and overfed and housed luxuriously. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> to which no respectable reader {{can be expected to}} listen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades!" [...] he cried, in a {{voice that}} made every man jump out of his boots, [...] "have we come here for this? Do we live {{underground}} like rats in order to listen to talk like this? <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat. Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us, 'Be good, and you will be happy,' 'Honesty is the best policy,' and 'Virtue is its own reward'? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory's address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure (hear, hear). But I am not a curate (loud cheers), and I did not listen to it with pleasure (renewed cheers). The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute, forcible, and efficient Thursday (hear, hear)." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why did {{you tell}} her? She could not but have spoken her mind when you told her. There must have been much between you when <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> of." ...|$|R
60|$|All <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> {{over and}} commented upon by our people {{as the days}} wore on, and the more timid seemed to find delight in picturing what would take place if the fort was captured.|$|R

60|$|But, {{as we said}} before, all <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> about; {{and ladies}} in their letters, chronicling {{the events of the}} passing hour, sent the tidings up and down the country; and so Miss Letitia Ferguson got a letter from Mrs. Wilcox with full {{pictures}} and comments; and she brought the same to Grace Seymour.|$|R
60|$|Reggie blinked. His misgiving returned. Either his ears, {{like his}} eyes, were playing him tricks, or else <b>this</b> waiter-chappie <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> pure drivel.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> album <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> {{less about}} innate {{feelings}} {{and more about}} the impact between myself or ourselves and the world around us. -Juanita Stein, Repeat ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Crosseyed and Painless" [...] was {{a promotional}} single from the album Remain In Light by new wave band Talking Heads. Although the single {{failed to reach}} on the US main charts, it reached to 20 on the US Dance charts. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>Talking</b> Heads's highest {{charting}} dance single of all time. It was also the second music video to be released by the band in 1981.|$|R
50|$|WJIA's United We Stand Campaign (9/11/01 until 10/1/01): <b>This</b> <b>was</b> a <b>talk</b> {{show that}} {{provided}} {{coverage of the}} attacks.|$|R

50|$|The {{merit of}} <b>this</b> poem <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about melancholy in a mild and subtle way with using autumn. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> one reason people love this poem and quote it ever so often today.|$|R
2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> a <b>talk</b> Palmer gave at Temple University in February 1999, and was {{originally}} published in [...] (Issue 2, 2003).|$|R

5000|$|In Baba Metziah: [...] "Im oveer v'lo ashalem alpha zuzey" [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about {{a person}} who is {{counting}} on not having to pay a sum to the person he owes it to. If Kenny says he will pay money to Simon if he does not do the work Simon assigns to him. But Kenny does not really want to commit to paying money to Simon, so he is committing to something {{he does not want to}} do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh--pooh, Dick, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> {{more like}} a poet than a seaman. If only {{one-half}} the sovereigns who deserve to be execrated had their names erased, the list of even our English kings would be rather short; and some countries would be without historical kings at all. However much Richard III. may deserve cashiering in this summary manner, his peers and laws are {{just as good as}} any other prince's peers and laws. Witness the Duke of Norfolk, for instance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh stop," [...] cried Barrow; [...] "give {{the man a}} chance." [...] He turned, {{and said}} with some severity, [...] "Tracy, what's the matter with you? What kind of foolishness <b>is</b> <b>this</b> you've <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b> You ought to have more sense." ...|$|R

Every year, around 90,000 professionals are estimated to take a career break. It is most common in the UK, where it grew out of the gap year concept. The career break is sometimes referred to as an 'adult gap year', which reflects the commitment towards developing skills and gaining experience while out of the workforce. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> about by Stefan Sagmeister in his TED talk [...] "The power of time off".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see now,' {{continued}} Mr Mifflin, 'that {{there was}} a flaw in my original plan. My idea <b>was</b> <b>this.</b> We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> in the train about the bathing down here, and Jane happened to say she could swim some, and it suddenly came to me.' ...|$|R
50|$|A {{section of}} X-Force {{headquarters}} is {{set aside for}} Doop's family, who are never seen in panel. <b>This</b> part <b>is</b> <b>talked</b> about very little by the team. The team hides in this area when they believed themselves to be in supernatural danger.|$|R

6000|$|This last word, {{falling into}} Mrs Verloc’s ear, {{produced}} a definite impression. <b>This</b> man <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of going abroad. The impression was completely disconnected; and {{such is the}} force of mental habit that Mrs Verloc at once and automatically asked herself: “And what of Stevie?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace! O brothers!" [...] Tyee {{swept the}} {{assembly}} with his hands. [...] "Let {{the women and}} children go to their igloos. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> the <b>talk</b> of men; let it be for the ears of men." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} said one word {{here about the}} physic or {{preparations}} that we ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion--I mean we that went frequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> of in the books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have said enough already. It may, however, be added, that the College of Physicians were daily publishing several preparations, which they had considered of {{in the process of}} their practice, and which, being to be had in print, I avoid repeating them for that reason.|$|R
40|$|<b>This</b> {{dissertation}} <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about rewarding {{and motivational}} system of employees in a selected company.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} fool game you think you're playing, but I can't {{see why you}} couldn't have told me <b>this</b> when we <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> after lunch." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Easterfield was silent. She {{was trying}} to make up her mind whether <b>this</b> girl <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> sense or nonsense. What she said seemed to be {{extremely}} nonsensical, but as she said it, it was difficult to believe that she did not consider it to be entirely rational.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> tall <b>talk,</b> sir," [...] said O'Leary; [...] "the {{long and}} short of it is, what will the cove, yourself, or whoever {{it is that you}} speak for, come down for one way or another?" ...|$|R
