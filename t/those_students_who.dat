Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, George Padmore, who {{was working}} for the Soviet-run Comintern. Over time, he became Padmore's protégé. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before the end of the year, the duo {{relocated}} to Moscow, where Kenyatta was instructed in becoming a professional revolutionary at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There, he was among <b>those</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. During his time in the Soviet Union, Kenyatta also visited Siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour. The emergence of the Nazi administration in Germany shifted political allegiances in Europe, as the Soviet Union sought to establish formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, thereby reducing its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in Africa. As a result, Comintern disbanded the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, to which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, with the latter returning to London in August 1933.|$|E

5000|$|Willis {{uses the}} {{qualitative}} research methods of participant observation and group interviews to study an informal (but socially cohesive) group of twelve lads at Hammertown Boys. He distinguishes between two distinct, informal {{groups of the}} working-class students at Hammertown Boys: lads and 'ear'oles. Whereas the lads are <b>those</b> nonconformist <b>students</b> <b>who</b> defy authority, 'ear'oles are <b>those</b> conformist <b>students</b> <b>who</b> invest themselves in formal learning and academic achievement, and therefore in the authority of teachers and the school system. The term [...] "'ear'ole" [...] recalls the earhole or earlobe, signifying conformist students' passive reception of learning. This contrasts with lads' rowdy, active behavior in school. The lads perceive themselves as more manly, more authentic, and more independent than the 'ear'oles.|$|R

25|$|A {{typology}} of academic misconduct has been devised by Perry (2010).

The artist had not known any of these men personally, and thus had to rely on photographs and descriptions from their colleagues to complete their likenesses. Many of Washington's portraits are still on display in Preston Library on the VMI campus. Also in the Institute's collections are a number of landscapes and genre paintings he completed after poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Washington was also active in promoting the Institute's cultural life; he founded an art gallery on campus, for which he secured funding from William Wilson Corcoran, and taught fine arts to <b>those</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> desired such instruction.

25|$|In 1906, {{after the}} {{abolition}} of the imperial examinations, the Qing government established many new schools and encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan. A new class of intellectuals emerged from <b>those</b> <b>students,</b> <b>who</b> contributed immensely to the Xinhai Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were all Chinese students in Japan.

25|$|In 1883 Dewey became {{librarian}} of Columbia College, and in {{the following}} year founded there the School of Library Economy, the first institution for the instruction of librarians ever organized. The proposal to establish the school was approved by the college's Board of Trustees on 5 May 1884. After a period of preparation, the school was officially opened on 5 January 1887, with an enrollment of 20 students—three men and 17 women. Women were admitted to the program at Dewey's insistence and against the wishes of the college's Regents. Although the school had a promising start, Dewey's conflicts with the university officials, in particular over the issue of the presence of women, led to its future being cast in doubt, and by 1888 it was apparent that Columbia intended to close it. However, at that point, Dewey, upon accepting a position with the New York State Library in Albany, successfully secured the agreement of its Regents to have the school transferred there. The formal transfer was accomplished in 1889, and the school, which was ultimately very successful, was re-established in Albany as the New York State Library School under Dewey's direction. (The school returned to Columbia's Manhattan campus in 1926.) Dewey did not forget his Columbia students. He petitioned the University of the State of New York, which granted degrees to <b>those</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> agreed to submit to examinations and produce a bibliography and thesis. Two students participated, including future ALA registrar and college archivist Nina Browne.|$|E
