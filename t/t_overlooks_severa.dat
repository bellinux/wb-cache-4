Have you ever thought of letter writing {{as one of the}} fine arts? It is, really. If you have a reputation as a writer of clever letters, you have achieved at least a small degree of fame. Your letters are more of a clue to your personality than you may imagine, because if they are sincere they contain a part of your own self. They should have a distinctive flavor-and although they may be demure, racy or a bit on the sophisticated side, they are truly a part of you. A letter is a substitute for your presence.

40|$|The {{conventional}} view of {{the knowledge}} economy based on high technology industries and frontier technologies, like biotech and nanotechnology, presents an incomplete picture. Don 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>overlook</b> the significance of low and medium technology industries in services and manufacturing (eg. food processing, transport, financial services, timber and metal products) that are innovative, knowledge-intensive and growing steadily. In Australia, like most advanced economies, high technology or science-based industries and the technologies underlying them are very important, {{but they are also}} very small. Such high technology industries account for only around 3 per cent of GNP in most OECD economies. More significant {{to our understanding of the}} knowledge economy is the way innovation and growth occurs in the low and medium technology sectors, which form the bulk of the economy in Australia and in the OECD. These sectors include food processing, metal products, chemicals, timber products, printing and publishing, transport, mechanical engineering, mining, the hospitality industry, financial services, health and the like. Innovation in such industries is not based on investment in research and development, but on the painstaking development of new product concepts that either solve consumer problems or meet market demands. The reality of innovation is that it rests not on scientific discovery, but on learning and problem-solving by firms...|$|R
40|$|This {{remarkable}} ethnographic {{study of}} the Syrian-Lebanese in North Dakota is unique. The data and information are original, {{never mind that the}} voices heard are nearly those of the early settlers, certainly those of their children. The authors use the records of the late 1930 s (early 1940 s) Federal Writers Projects and the Works Progress Administration to understand the reasons for Arab migration to North Dakota and the Great Plains, their employment practices, life styles (marriage patterns, culinary habits), and religious traditions, their distribution, settlements, institutions (or lack thereof), and finally their near total assimilation. If it were homesteading that attracted many Syrians to the Midwest, it was peddling that made them successful Homesteading also explains why more Lebanese than Syrians settled there. Syrians from Mt. Lebanon came from smaller, rural communities and farmed. Those from Syria proper were often from Damascus and Aleppo, established cities. An old Arab proverb states 2 ̆ 2 Trade takes a man far 2 ̆ 2 and if Syrians do anything well it is buying and selling. An entire economic chain developed among them wherein Syrian wholesalers in the Northeast supplied 2 ̆ 2 peddlers 2 ̆ 2 with goods that they brought to needy customers throughout the West. To facilitate economic success, the community published a Syrian Business Directory (1908), which included the names and addresses of every Syrian enterprise in the United States. Peddling Syrians is not a stereotype. It was their signature occupation. Another distinguishing characteristic of this book is its inclusion and respect for the early, oft-ignored Arab Muslim settlers. If anything, emphasis has always been on the Christian emigrants (of all denominations and rites) who settled in large Northeastern cities. Today 2 ̆ 7 s Arab-American scholarship, of course, can 2 ̆ 7 t and doesn 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>overlook</b> Muslims, but to see how the Syrian Muslims {{at the turn of the}} century accommodated rural American society (and vice versa) is an eye-opener.

25|$|After an {{ineffective}} first <b>Test,</b> Best was <b>overlooked</b> for the West Indies' overseas {{tours and}} drifted out of contention {{with the emergence}} of fellow fast bowlers Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor. Back at domestic level, he fell out of favour and struggled to be selected for Barbados' Red Stripe Bowl side. While he was infrequently chosen for the one-day team, he improved on his previous season's wicket tally in the first-class competition and finished with 49wickets including three five-wicket hauls, and was rewarded with a call up to the West Indies side to face England in March 2004. Best's first international wickets came in his second Test, the first in a four-match series against England; his maiden dismissal was that of batsman Graham Thorpe. England won the series 3–0 and Best finished as the West Indies' leading wicket-taker in the series (and third overall) with 12 from four matches at a cost of 25.08runs each.|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{specific}} guidance on {{the implementation of}} cost-effectiveness modelling at the early stage of test development. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the literature in this field to examine the methodologies and tools that have been employed to date. Areas Covered: A systematic review to identify relevant studies in established literature databases. Five studies were identified and included for narrative synthesis. These studies revealed that there is no consistent approach in this growing field. The perspective of patients and the potential for value of information (VOI) to provide information on the value of future research is often <b>overlooked.</b> <b>Test</b> accuracy is an essential consideration, with most studies having described and included all possible test results in their analysis, and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses on important parameters. Headroom analysis was considered in some instances but at the early development stage (not the concept stage). Expert commentary: The techniques available to modellers that can demonstrate the value of conducting further research and product development (i. e. VOI analysis, headroom analysis) should be better utilized. There is the need for concerted efforts to develop rigorous methodology in this growing field to maximize the value and quality of such analysis...|$|R
40|$|Infection by the {{gastroduodenal}} pathogen Helicobacter pylori elicits {{a complex}} immunologic {{response in the}} mucosa involving neutrophils, plasma cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, of which T cells are the principal orchestrators of immunity. While so-called classical T cells (e. g. T-helper cells) that are activated by peptide fragments presented on antigen-presenting cells have received much attention in H. pylori infection, there exists a diverse array of other T cell populations that are potentially important for {{the outcome of the}} ensuing immune response, some of which have not been extensively studied in H. pylori infection. Pathogen-specific regulatory T cells that control and prevent the development of immunopathology associated with H. pylori infection have been investigated, but these cells can also benefit the bacterium in helping to prolong the chronicity of the infection by suppressing protective immune responses. An <b>overlooked</b> <b>T</b> cell population, the more recently described Th 17 cells, {{may play a role in}} H. pylori-induced inflammation, due to triggering responses that ultimately lead to the recruitment of polymorphs, including neutrophils. The so-called innate or unconventional T cells, that include two conserved T cell subsets expressing invariant antigen-specific receptors, the CD 1 d-restricted natural killer T cells which are activated by glycolipids, and the mucosal-associated invariant T cells which play a role in defense against orally acquired pathogens in the intestinal mucosa, have only begun to receive attention. A greater knowledge of the range of T cell responses induced by H. pylori is required for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of this bacterium and its ability to perpetuate chronic infection, and could reveal new strategies for therapeutic exploitation.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of three different}} techniques for determining proton rotating frame relaxation rates (T 1 pH) in charred and uncharred woods is compared. The variable contact time (VCT) experiment is shown to over-estimate T 1 pH, particularly for the charred samples, due {{to the presence of}} slowly cross-polarizing C- 13 nuclei. The variable spin (VSL) or delayed contact experiment is shown to overcome these problems; however, care is needed in the analysis to ensure rapidly relaxing components are not <b>overlooked.</b> <b>T</b> 1 pH is shown to be non-uniform for both charred and uncharred wood samples; a rapidly relaxing component (T 1 pH = 0. 46 - 1. 07 ms) and a slowly relaxing component (T 1 pH = 3. 58 - 7. 49) is detected in each sample. T 1 pH for each component generally decreases with heating temperature (degree of charring) and the proportion of rapidly relaxing component increases. Direct T 1 pH determination (via H- 1 detection) shows that all samples contain an even faster relaxing component (0. 09 - 0. 24 ms) that is virtually undetectable by the indirect (VCT and VSL) techniques. A new method for correcting for T 1 pH signal losses in spin counting experiments is developed to deal with the rapidly relaxing component detected in the VSL experiment. Implementation of this correction increased the proportion of potential C- 13 CPMAS NMR signal that can be accounted for by up to 50 % for the charred samples. An even greater proportion of potential signal can be accounted for if the very rapidly relaxing component detected in the direct T 1 pH determination is included; however, it must be kept in mind that this experiment also detects H- 1 pools which may not be involved in H- 1 -C- 13 cross-polarization.
