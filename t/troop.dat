5|$|Each <b>troop</b> {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly <b>troop</b> meeting. The patrol's independence from the <b>troop</b> varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the <b>troop</b> attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the <b>troop.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Court of Honour is {{a regular}} meeting of Patrol Leaders (PLs) and the <b>Troop</b> Scouter, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of decisions regarding <b>troop</b> discipline, patrol management, <b>troop</b> programme and other matters. The <b>Troop</b> Scouter is the only adult leader regularly attending these meetings, although the Court of Honour may invite other Scouters to attend. The <b>Troop</b> Scouter has the right to veto decision, but should generally only act in an advisory role, allowing the Scouts themselves to make important decisions.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{leader of}} a Scout <b>Troop</b> is the <b>Troop</b> Scouter (TS), {{assisted}} by Assistant <b>Troop</b> Scouters (ATS) and Junior Assistant <b>Troop</b> Scouters (JATS). Scout Troops often give their adult leaders nicknames related to their branch of Scouting (Land Scout, Air Scout, or Sea Scout).|$|E

He had two groups under his command: the 374th <b>Troop</b> Carrier Group at Ward's Field and the 375th <b>Troop</b> Carrier Group at Dobodura, plus the 65th and 66th <b>Troop</b> Carrier Squadrons of the 403rd <b>Troop</b> Carrier Group at Jackson's Field. In addition, Prentiss could draw on the 317th <b>Troop</b> Carrier Group at Archerfield Airport and RAAF Base Townsville, {{although it was not}} under his command. Postponing the operation from August to September 1943 allowed for the arrival of the 433rd <b>Troop</b> Carrier Group from the United States. Each squadron was equipped with 13 C-47 aircraft, and each group consisted of four squadrons, for a total of 52 aircraft per group.|$|E
5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. As {{there were not}} enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for <b>troop</b> transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 <b>troop</b> sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 <b>troop</b> kitchen cars.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor has {{groups in}} several Scouting organizations, {{including}} Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout <b>Troop</b> 18.

The village's first Boy Scout <b>troop</b> was <b>Troop</b> 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout <b>troop</b> in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie <b>troop</b> was founded in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Each sabre {{squadron}} {{is approximately}} 90-strong, and {{is divided into}} three troops (Water <b>Troop,</b> Free-Fall <b>Troop</b> and Vehicle Mounted <b>Troop).</b> A <b>troop</b> comprises four patrols with five or six operators in each patrol, and is commanded by a captain with each patrol commanded by a sergeant. For surveillance operations the SASR usually operates in patrols; however, for CT operations it usually employs larger force elements. Support personnel include signallers, mechanics and technicians, medical staff, storemen, drivers, caterers and various specialists. It was reported in 2012 that six female soldiers were being trained in the United States. As of 2003, 152 Signal Squadron comprised four troops. Military dogs, designated Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), have been members of the SASR since 2005, seeing service in Afghanistan and have their own memorial.|$|E
5|$|Every <b>troop</b> has two {{separate}} leadership structures: one consisting of Scouts and another consisting of adults. The adult leadership manages {{the logistics of}} <b>troop</b> activities, administers rank advancement and awards, maintains <b>troop</b> records and finance, and recruits new Scouts and adult leaders.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch <b>Troop,</b> No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons <b>troop</b> was No. 4 <b>Troop.</b> The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 <b>Troop,</b> to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 <b>Troop</b> and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 <b>Troop</b> would secure the left flank and No. 2 <b>Troop</b> the right.|$|E

50|$|The first {{obstacle}} to cross was the Chienti river. Polish <b>troops</b> reached it on 21 June, and heavy fighting lasted {{in that region}} until 30 June. The main offensive on Ancona began on 17 July. Polish armored <b>troops</b> took Monte della Crescia and outflanked German <b>troops</b> defending Ancona. Next, Polish <b>troops</b> secured Casenuove, and neighbouring British and Canadian <b>troops</b> took Montecchio and Croce di San Vincenzo. By the evening of 17 July, Polish <b>troops</b> were near Agugliano, and the following morning they took Offagna. Later that day, Polish <b>troops</b> took Chiaravalle, and armored <b>troops</b> reached the sea, cutting the German defenders of Ancona from the north-west. The Germans were falling back towards the sea, and Polish <b>troops</b> encountered little resistance entering Ancona at 14:30 on 18 July.|$|R
5|$|MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington {{to provide}} more <b>troop</b> carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a high {{priority}} for transport aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked to bring it up to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th <b>Troop</b> Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd <b>Troop</b> Carrier Squadron was held up in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st <b>Troop</b> Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd <b>Troop</b> Carrier Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Often {{the most}} senior and {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as <b>Troop</b> Leader (TL), who no longer runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme. Since a <b>Troop</b> Leader {{is not required to}} plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts who are in their final year of school choose to become <b>Troop</b> Leaders to have more time to concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E
5|$|Pilot-testing and {{experimentation}} continued {{for three more}} years. An experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969.

The No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was formed from volunteers from the {{occupied}} territories and enemy aliens. It was the largest Commando unit formed, and contained troops from France, Belgium, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and No. 3 (X) <b>Troop.</b> The No. 3 (X) <b>Troop</b> consisted of enemy aliens; it was also known as the English, Jewish, or British <b>troop</b> and was officially renamed the Miscellaneous <b>Troop</b> in 1944.

5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the <b>troop</b> is the senior patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the <b>troop.</b> He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the <b>troop,</b> runs <b>troop</b> meetings and ensures that the program for <b>troop</b> meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders.
