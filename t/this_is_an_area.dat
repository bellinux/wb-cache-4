The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land. North of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of mostly forested land and {{the central part of the}} watershed is mostly agricultural land. The northern part includes both forested and agricultural land. The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> {{that has long been}} criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of}} a deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> with <b>a</b> {{peculiar}} history; its 1640s rector Robert Maxwell told pamphleteers that 154,000 Protestants {{had been}} massacred {{there in the}} 1649 Rising. This figure would have represented one-tenth of the entire island of Ireland (historians put the number of Protestants killed at somewhere between 527 and 1,259; many hundreds of Catholics were killed in reprisals by the Protestant incomers). <b>This</b> figure <b>was</b> used by Oliver Cromwell {{as the basis for}} his invasion of Ireland during the English Civil War.|$|R
25|$|Despite their {{relative}} abundance, fairyflies are unpopular among modern insect collectors {{because of the}} great difficulty in collecting them.

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{interest}} in Tang poetry {{in the field of}} gender studies. Although most of the poets were men, there were several significant women. Also, many of the men wrote from the viewpoint of a woman, or lovingly of other men. Historically and geographically localized in Tang dynasty China, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> which has not escaped interest from the perspective of historical gender roles.|$|E
25|$|These time {{intervals}} {{would seem}} to be reversed; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Glasgow most of {{the city}} centre is not pedestrianised, with the {{exception}} of Rose Street (parallel to Princes Street), which is pedestrianised along its length. A section of the Royal Mile - one of the main tourist streets in Edinburgh - from the junction of George IV Bridge (Melbourne Place) to the junction with North Bridge, is pedestrianised through the use of automatic bollards which only give access to authorised vehicles. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> with pavement cafes and bars with tables outside.|$|E

Most activity is located in the densely populated areas of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Haifa (Matam), and Jerusalem (Technology Park, Malha, Har Hotzvim and JVP Media Quarter in Talpiot), and the Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area, although some secondary with additional activity include the corridor to Beer Sheba, including Kiryat Gat, and the Western Galilee.

Directly ahead of the Members' Hall is the Ministerial Wing, housing the office suites of the Prime Minister and government Ministers. The Members' Hall has access to the House of Representatives and the Senate buildings to the left and right of the main entrance to the halls respectively. Public access to the visitors' galleries and the Main Committee Room is via an upper level reached by impressive marble staircases ascending from the entrance foyer. There are also 19 committee rooms which {{are open to the public}} and a highly secure Cabinet Room on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> {{within the}} visual cortex {{that has been}} found to play an {{important}} role in the target selection of saccades. In other words, this area is important for determining which objects our eyes shift to when they move. Studies have shown that there is a large amount of activation within the visual area V4 before the saccade even takes place. This occurs in the form of shrinking receptive fields. The receptive fields of these brain cells tend to shift towards the object that the eye is about to move towards, generally more so if the object is close to the original fixation point. This dynamic change in receptive fields is thought to enhance the perception and recognition of objects in a visual scene. Because the receptive fields become smaller around the targeted objects, attention within the visual scene is very focused on these objects. Increased attention to target objects within a visual scene help direct eye movements from one object to another. Understanding of the visual scene becomes more efficient because these attention shifts guide the eyes towards relevant objects as opposed to objects that may not be as important.|$|E
