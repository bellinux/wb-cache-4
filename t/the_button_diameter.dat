40|$|Induced {{charges on}} a four-button beam {{position}} monitor (BPM) system attached on a beam chamber of narrow rectangular cross sections are calculated as a 2 -D electrostatic problem of image charges. The calculation shows {{that for a}} narrow chamber of width/height (2 w/ 2 h) {much_gt} 1, over 90 % of the induced charges are distributed within a distance of 2 h from the charged beam position {{in the direction of}} the chamber width. Therefore, a four-button system with a <b>button</b> <b>diameter</b> of (2 [...] 2. 5) h and no <b>button</b> offset from <b>the</b> beam position is the most efficient configuration. The four-button BPMs used for 8 -mm and 5 -mm chambers in the APS have relatively low sensitivities because <b>the</b> <b>button</b> locations are outside the range where the induced charge densities are low and <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>diameters</b> are less than 2 h. Using derived formulae, button sensitivities and beam position coefficients are calculated for <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> of <b>the</b> most efficient case and of the 8 -mm and 5 -mm chambers.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o cultivo de bastão-do-imperador sob diferentes espaçamentos de plantio em clima subtropical. Os espaçamentos utilizados entre plantas na linha e entre linhas foram: 2, 0 x 2, 0 m; 2, 5 x 2, 0 m e 3, 0 x 2, 0 m. Após 16 meses do plantio, iniciaram-se as avaliações do comprimento e diâmetro da haste da inflorescência, diâmetro basal da inflorescência (com brácteas abertas), diâmetro do botão da inflorescência, comprimento da inflorescência, número de hastes vegetativas por touceira, área de ocupação da touceira, altura da maior haste vegetativa e produção média de inflorescências por touceira. Os diferentes espaçamentos influenciaram no diâmetro da haste da inflorescência e na área de ocupação da touceira. Durante o período da pesquisa, houve aumento no comprimento da haste da inflorescência e nos diâmetros basal e botão da inflorescência. Nas condições de clima subtropical, é possível obter inflorescências de bastão-do-imperador com características comerciais adequadas. A maior produção foi observada utilizando-se o espaçamento de 3, 0 x 2, 0 m.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between thumb muscle activity and thumb operating tasks on a smartphone touchscreen in elderly users (right hand posture). Three thumb muscles were targeted in the experiment, namely, abductor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis longus (APL) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI). The {{results showed that the}} elderly participants developed fatigue rapidly and tapped more slowly when operating on smaller <b>buttons</b> (<b>diameter</b> 3.0  mm compared with 9.0  mm) and moving in the flexion–extension (compared with adduction–abduction) orientation.

This study suggests that the use of small touch-buttons and flexion–extension movement should be minimised in the handheld touchscreen interface design for elderly users.|$|R

50|$|A thread shank {{is created}} by loosely {{stitching}} a shankless button onto fabric. This is usually done by keeping a toothpick or other small object in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric while <b>the</b> <b>button</b> is stitched on. Once <b>the</b> <b>button</b> has been sewn through a few times, the toothpick is removed and the needle is moved down {{through one of the}} buttonholes, placing the needle and its thread in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric. <b>The</b> sewer takes care to not tighten the thread too much. While holding <b>the</b> <b>button</b> away from <b>the</b> garment, the thread is then firmly wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>button</b> (in between <b>the</b> <b>button</b> and fabric) a few times to form a sturdy wrapper for the other threads. The needle is then pushed through the fabric to the underside of the garment, where it can then be securely fastened off. A thread shank's length depends on the thickness of the fabric that will be <b>buttoned.</b> <b>The</b> ideal thread shank is long enough to <b>button</b> <b>the</b> fabric and still have the garment draping nicely, but short enough that <b>the</b> <b>button</b> does not flop around when buttoned.|$|R

Desta forma, o objetivo deste trabalho é realizar um estudo sobre a eficiência energética das máquinas CA e MFDC, dividindo em três partes de atuação. A primeira contempla o desenvolvimento de um modelo matemático para cada máquina. Em seguida, ambos os modelos são validados por meio de um planejamento fatorial 3 k, onde os fatores são a corrente e espessura da chapa. As respostas observadas foram o efeito na corrente do primário, que comparada com a corrente simulada validou os modelos matemáticos. A terceira fase trata da análise do rendimento, através de um planejamento composto central (PCC), onde os fatores foram o tempo, a força, a corrente e a espessura da chapa, e como resposta adotou-se os parâmetros rendimento elétrico e diâmetro do botão de solda. É possível concluir que a máquina CA apresentou melhor rendimento em relação à máquina MFDC, tendo como principal efeito as máquinas de soldagem a resistência por pontos.
