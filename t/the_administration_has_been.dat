Even if you honestly think <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> at fault, it won't do any good to grumble.

50|$|As of mid-August 2017, Congress has not {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} a wall, and no further wall construction has started beyond what was already planned during the Obama administration. Since the middle of May, the effort by the White House to pursue building a wall {{appears to have been}} put on-hold, at least temporarily, as <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> spending more time defending Trump from allegations of inappropriately dismissing James Comey (now former Director of the FBI), and carelessly disclosing classified information to Russia.|$|E
5000|$|Critics of {{the bill}} {{expressed}} concern, that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> guided {{by the same people}} who previously lobbied for patent reform on behalf of IBM and Microsoft, and that their appointments were a violation of the Obama Administration's [...] "Revolving Door Ban". USPTO Director David Kappos represented IBM, Marc Berejka (Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce) lobbied on behalf of Microsoft, and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, to whom the USPTO reported until Locke was made Ambassador to China on August 1, 2011, also has extensive ties to Microsoft.|$|E

Acting {{under the guidance of}} what we believe to be an erroneous opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> employing this misguided approach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the advice and consent of the Senate.

50|$|Construction of {{the tower}} began in 1956 when Italy was {{experiencing}} an economic boom. The tower was {{to be surrounded by}} low lying buildings on a pentagonal plot of land. Upon its completion in 1958, it became a symbol not only of Milan, but also of the economic recovery of Italy after the devastation of World War Two. At 127 m, it was the tallest building in Italy after Mole Antonelliana and so remained up to 1995. The building was sold to the Lombardy regional administration in 1978.

50|$|The SESAMO_Win {{methodology}} {{is provided}} with a software for administering the questionnaire and creating a multifactorial multilevel evaluation Report.This software analyses and decodes the answers obtained through direct administration on the computer or entered into the computer from printed forms and produces an anamnestic report about the subjects' sexual and relational condition. Once <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> completed, the software does not allow the questionnaire and its respective report to be altered or manipulated. This is necessary for deontological reasons and, above all, to assure its validity in legal appraisals and screenings.The software processes a report for each questionnaire. Each report can be displayed on the computer monitor or printed out. It is also possible to print out the whole report or its single parts.|$|E

5000|$|Biden's most {{important}} role within <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that, [...] "The {{best thing about}} Joe {{is that when we}} get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1-1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.Throughout, Joe and Jill Biden maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining some of their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{conceding that}} our {{consumption}} {{of fossil fuels}} is causing serious damage and despite implying that current policy is inadequate, the Report fails {{to take the next}} step and recommend serious alternatives. Rather, it suggests that we simply need to accommodate to the coming changes. For example, reminiscent of former Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal that the government address the hole in the ozone layer by encouraging Americans to make better use of sunglasses, suntan lotion and broad-brimmed hats, the Report suggests that we can deal with heat-related health impacts by increased use of air-conditioning ... Far from proposing solutions to the climate change problem, <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> adopting energy policies that would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, even as the Report identifies increased air conditioner use as one of the 'solutions' to climate change impacts, the Department of Energy has decided to roll back energy efficiency standards for air conditioners.

50|$|Muri came {{nominally}} under British {{control in}} 1900. The principal effort of <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{to control and}} open the trade routes. In 1904 an expedition against the northern cannibals resulted in the capture of their principal fortresses and the settlement and opening to trade of a large district, the various routes to the Benue being rendered safe. In 1905 an expedition against the Munshi, rendered necessary by an unprovoked attack on the Niger Company's station at Abinsi, had a good effect in reducing the riverain portion of this tribe to submission. The absence of any central native authority delayed the process of bringing the province under administrative control. Its government was organized on the same system {{as the rest of}} Northern Nigeria, and under a British Resident. It was divided into three administrative divisions -east, central and west- with their respective headquarters at Lau, Amar and Ibi. Provincial and native courts of justice were established. The telegraph was carried to the town of Muri. Muri is one of the provinces in which the slave trade was most active, and its position between German territory and the Hausa states rendered it {{in the early days of}} the British administration a favorite route for the smuggling of slaves.|$|E

50|$|The Ramos {{administration}} had budget surpluses for {{four of its}} six years in power. The government benefited from the massive sale of government assets (totalling to about ₱70 billion, the biggest among the administrations) and continued {{to benefit from the}} 1986 TRP. The administration invested heavily on the power sector as the country was beset by power outages. The government utilized its emergency powers to fast-track the construction of power projects and established contracts with independent power plants. This period also experienced a real estate boom and strong foreign direct investment to the country {{during the early years of}} the administration, in effect overvaluing the peso. However, with the onset of the Asian financial crisis, the peso depreciated by almost 40%. The Ramos administration relied heavily on external borrowing to finance its fiscal deficit but quickly switched to domestic dependence on the onset of the Asian financial crisis. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accused of resorting to “budget trickery” during the crisis: balancing assets through the sales of assets, building up accounts payable and delaying payment of government premium to social security holders. In 1997, the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) was enacted. Republic Act (RA) 8184 and RA 8240, which were implemented under the program, were estimated to yield additional taxes of around ₱7.4 billion; however, a decline in tax effort during the succeeding periods was observed after the CTRP was implemented. This was attributed to the unfavorable economic climate created by the Asian fiscal crisis and the poor implementation of the provisions of the reform. A sharp decrease in international trade tax contribution to GDP was also observed as a consequence of the trade liberalization and globalization efforts in the 1990s, more prominently, the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) and membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The Ramos administration also provided additional incentives to export-oriented firms, the most prominent among these being RA 7227 which was instrumental to the success of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.|$|E
