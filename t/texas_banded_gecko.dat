50|$|Birds, lizards, {{and mice}} are also preyed upon, with lizards mostly being eaten by young snakes. Avian prey include mockingbirds (Mimidae), quail, a nearly full-grown Gambel's quail, a {{burrowing}} owl (Athene cunicularia), a fledgling horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) a black-throated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), and an eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Lizard prey include a whiptail lizard (Cnemidophorus), spiny lizards (Sceloporus), a <b>Texas</b> <b>banded</b> <b>gecko</b> (Coleonyx brevis), and a side-blotched lizard (Uta palmeri). One case reported by Vorhies (1948) involved a juvenile specimen that {{had attempted to}} eat a horned lizard (Phrynosoma solare), but died after the lizard's horns had punctured its esophagus, leaving the lizard stuck there.|$|E

50|$|<b>Texas</b> <b>banded</b> <b>geckos</b> are small, {{terrestrial}} lizards, rarely exceeding 4 in in length. They have alternating {{bands of}} yellow and brown or pink colored banding down their body, generally with black accenting on the bands, and sometimes {{with varying degrees of}} black speckling. Hatchlings and Juveniles display a banded pattern; banded pattern gets a more mottled appearance as the gecko becomes an adult.|$|R

50|$|He is {{honored by}} having several reptile species named after him, {{including}} the Western <b>Banded</b> <b>Gecko,</b> Coleonyx variegatus bogerti, and the genus of rat snakes, Bogertophis.

50|$|The Central American <b>banded</b> <b>gecko</b> is crepuscular {{and hides}} in a burrow {{in the soil}} during the day. It emerges at dusk to forage for insects. If threatened, like most geckos, it can lose its tail. Most will {{regenerate}} lost tails within a year.|$|R

50|$|The western <b>banded</b> <b>gecko</b> is a {{terrestrial}} lizard, {{ranging in}} total length (including tail) from 4 - 6 in. Hatchlings measure 1 in.

40|$|Aggregating {{has been}} widely studied {{in a variety of}} animals and found to have {{important}} benefits in terms of sociality, courtship, predator avoidance and physiology. Several species of nocturnal geckos form diurnal aggregations; however, {{little is known about the}} benefits of these groupings. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the benefit of aggregation for the desert-dwelling western <b>banded</b> <b>gecko,</b> Coleonyx variegatus. We found that <b>banded</b> <b>geckos</b> benefit from aggregation by a reduction in evaporative water loss (EWL). No social or mating benefits were detected, and geckos did not group to avoid predators. Geckos did not select diurnal retreat sites based solely on the scent of conspecifics, although they aggregated readily when conspecifics were present. Thus, C. variegatus appear to achieve physiological but not social benefits from grouping. <b>Banded</b> <b>geckos</b> belong to an ancestrally tropical lineage whose descendants invaded present-day North American deserts at a time when these regions were more mesic. This may explain their relatively high rate of EWL. Aggregating seems to be a solution to this physiological handicap. Our study also suggests a path for the evolution of social behaviour: as animals aggregate for physiological benefits, the stage is set for the evolution of more complex social interactions.

The formation of social aggregations is widespread in animals and can have important reproductive, ecological and fitness implications (Boersma 1982; Cohen & Alford 1996; Avilés & Turfiño 1998; Caro 1998). Some species aggregate to mitigate physiological stresses imposed by their abiotic environment, such as low moisture availability (e. g. Cohen & Alford 1996) or thermal extremes (e. g...|$|R
