5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> are realistic, unidealised {{and frank}} {{descriptions}} of the men.

They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E
