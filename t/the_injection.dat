5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> mould of a plastic part is called <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, {{injection moulding}} can produce flawed parts. In {{the field of}} injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> process.|$|E

5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. <b>The</b> <b>injection</b> of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E

5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, {{all of which}} have lava flows; the last one also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent flows from Licancabur and flows from Sairecabur. Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests.

Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Heartworm {{disease in}} dogs is a {{life-threatening}} parasitic disease. Although adulticide treatment with melarsomine {{has been proven}} {{to be the most}} effective, complications associated with adulticide treatment are major concerns for clinicians. Methods This study evaluated the change in levels of D-dimer, interleukin- 6, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I in 12 dogs with different severities of heartworm infection treated by the American Heartworm Society (AHS) recommended protocol during the treatment period. The serum levels of several markers were measured on the day of diagnosis (T- 60), before the initiation of melarsomine therapy (T 0), 1  day after <b>the</b> first <b>injection</b> (T 1), 1  week after <b>the</b> first <b>injection</b> (T 7), 1  month after <b>the</b> first <b>injection</b> (T 30), 1  day after <b>the</b> second <b>injection</b> (T 31), 1  day after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 32), 1  week after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 39), 1  month after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 62), 2  months after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 92), 3  months after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 122), and 6  months after <b>the</b> third <b>injection</b> (T 182). Results The serum levels of these markers were significantly different at the test time point after melarsomine treatment and also differed significantly according to the stage of heartworm disease in the dogs. Conclusion This study found that monitoring of inflammatory and hemostatic markers in dogs with heartworm disease being treated with melarsomine might be beneficial in predicting the clinical outcomes and complications associated with melarsomine treatment...|$|R

40|$|Myelin sheaths {{of rapidly}} growing rats were {{sequentially}} labeled with the 3 H and 14 C isotopes of leucine as precursors of protein synthesis. <b>The</b> two <b>injections</b> {{were separated by}} time intervals ranging from 2 to 12 d.

After 5 d of degeneration, myelin was purified and the ratio of isotopes was determined in the delipidated protein.

By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> of money directly into the economy – via the APF.

On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during <b>the</b> <b>injection</b> and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced.
