5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills {{to subsidize the}} Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste.

The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.|$|E

5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España instead. After first {{indicating}} a reluctant willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be nice, as would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only banking on riding for the overall at the Vuelta a España.|$|E

The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities through getting them tickets <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> Air Force one but she was denied of this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip of the then California's Governor and wife led to the closeness of the Reagans and Marcoses.|$|E

Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't have been allowed <b>to</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to {{a person with a}} disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the majority}} of the company's workers appeared for duty, but many were absent. The 65 crews of workmen were able to operate half of the normal routes, and were dispatched to continue operations. The strikers, supported by thousands of other pro-union men, continued their campaign. They blocked streetcar tracks, harassed workers, and demanded that the union be recognized by the company. Dozens of streetcars were vandalized, some were completely destroyed, the overhead electric cables that powered the cars were cut, and passengers were threatened to not <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> cars. Some company employees were forcibly taken multiple times to Labor Hall to repeat their oaths of loyalty to the union before they were convinced or intimidated to join the strike.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine.

5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to jump out of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
