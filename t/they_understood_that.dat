5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
25|$|Like fellow South African {{jazz musicians}} Dollar Brand and Hugh Masekela, <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> {{the only way}} they could play freely was by {{escaping}} the oppressive social and political climate of their home country. As a mixed-race band (McGregor the sole white member), they were especially prone to police harassment. In mid-1964, they left South Africa.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, six Breslov Hasidim were {{deported}} after attempting {{entry into}} Jordan {{in order to}} visit the tomb of Aaron / Sheikh Harun on Mount Hor, near Petra, because of an alert from the Ministry of Tourism. The group had taken a ferry from Sinai, Egypt because <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Jordanian authorities were making it hard for visible Jews to enter from Israel.

50|$|Many Cedar Crest {{students}} {{choose to}} combine {{a major in}} media studies with business, marketing, political science, English, or education, because <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> employees with communication and media literacy skills are in high demand. Graduates with these skills are prepared to become leaders in tomorrow's workforce.|$|R
5000|$|Mañjuśrī, people churn milk because <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{butter is}} present therein. Why do people not churn water ? Because that {{substance}} {{is not present}} there. Likewise, Mañjuśrī, people maintain moral discipline (śīla) and engage in the holy life (brahmacarya) because {{of the existence of}} the Tathāgata-garbha.|$|R
25|$|The African {{population}} {{on the island}} began to hear of the agitation for independence by the rich European planters, the grands blancs, who had resented France's limitations on the island's foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> if Saint-Domingue's independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The plantation owners {{would be free to}} operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, NCMC voted {{unanimously}} to approve the memorial foundation's preferred site on Washington Avenue SW. NCMC gave active consideration to six of the sites proposed by the foundation. District of Columbia officials strongly supported the preferred site in their testimony before the commission. D.C. officials expressed concern about two issues, however. The first {{was the number of}} pedestrians crossing 2nd Street SW to the east and Independence Avenue SW to the north to reach the memorial. The second was the weight of the planned memorial. The man-made below-ground structure supporting the existing parkland and streets was not designed to carry a heavy granite or bronze memorial, nor the weight of a fountain. They cautioned that the District of Columbia supported the preferred site only because <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the memorial would consist of a garden rather than sculpture or a monument. City officials, however, pledged to work with memorial designers to overcome these problems. Brown testified that the DVLMF supported the site because it had a direct line of sight with the U.S. Capitol, and would remind members of Congress of their weighty responsibilities when considering issues of war and peace.|$|E
500|$|High yield Champa paddy seeds, Korean yellow paddy, Indian green pea, and Middle East {{watermelon}} {{were introduced}} into China during this period, greatly enhancing {{the variety of}} farm produce. Song farmers {{emphasized the importance of}} night soil as fertilizer. <b>They</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> using night soil could transform barren wasteland into fertile farmland. Chen Pu wrote in his Book of Agriculture of 1149: [...] "The common saying that farmland becomes exhausted after seeding three to five years is not right, if frequently top up with new soil and cure with night soil, then the land becomes more fertile".|$|E

500|$|After Sesame Streets initial success, its {{producers}} {{began to}} think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the source of their funding, which they considered [...] "seed" [...] money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.|$|E
500|$|The match {{has been}} cited as a pivotal turning point in English football. Author Jason Cowley noted how instead of rioting, as had {{occurred}} at Heysel with fatal consequences, Liverpool fans stayed on after the game and applauded Arsenal [...] "as if <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> {{we were at the}} start of something new; {{that there would be no}} returning to the ways of old". Cowley describes the match as [...] "the night football was reborn" [...] and that the event [...] "repaired the reputation of football". Dominic Fifield suggested Arsenal's win [...] "had shattered the myth that Liverpool were invincible," [...] while Si Hughes in The Daily Telegraph wrote it [...] "...set in motion the decline of one of football’s grandest institutions." ...|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street's creators {{recognized}} that television lent itself {{well to the}} use of modelling as a teaching tool. <b>They</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. [...] One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. [...] If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.|$|E

500|$|The {{independent}} Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP) {{was established}} alongside the Vietnamese and Laotian parties following {{the dissolution of}} the Indochinese Communist Party in 1955. The Kampuchean movement was the weakest of the three. When the Vietnamese began formal military aid to the Khmer Rouge in 1970, the Khmer leadership remained skeptical. On the orders of Võ Chí Công two regiments were sent into Kampuchea. Võ Chí Công promised Khmer leader Ieng Sary that Vietnamese troops would withdraw when the conflict had been won by the communists. The entry of Vietnamese troops led many Vietnamese officials to believe that Khmer Rouge officials had begun [...] "to fear something". In a conversation with Phạm Hùng, Lê Duẩn told him that despite some differences in opinions, the [...] "authentic internationalism and attitude" [...] of the sides would strengthen their party-to-party relations. However, by reading reports by Võ Chí Công, Lê Duẩn probably concluded that [...] "authentic internationalism" [...] in Kampuchea was in trouble. At the time, the Vietnamese leadership hoped this situation would change, but privately <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the Kampuchean situation was different from the Lao situation.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 May 2015, the Spanish Defense Ministry {{confirmed}} that Spain's military air crash investigation agency, CITAAM, had taken {{charge of the}} investigation of the crash. The Spanish government had initially charged a civilian team, made up of experts from the transport and defense ministries, with the task, but the civilian team [...] "took the decision to withdraw because <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the plane has specific characteristics due to its military configuration which they were unfamiliar with," [...] according to a Defense Ministry spokesman.|$|E
2500|$|Peace Now's logo was {{designed}} by Israeli graphic designer David Tartakover in 1978. The logo emerged from a poster created by Tartakover for a mass rally, held {{in what is now}} Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on 1 April 1978, titled [...] "Peace Now." [...] It became the name of the organization, and was used on the first political bumper sticker in Israel. It is still one of Israel's most popular stickers. Tartakover, commenting in 2006, said [...] "The movement activists liked the logo, ut they thought there should also be a symbol. I told them it wasn't needed - this is the symbol. It took time until <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> this was the first political sticker in Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many ABA track {{operators}} were of {{the same}} opinion. [...] Also, since most track operators were businessmen themselves, <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the ABA filing for Chapter 11 protection wasn't the disastrous thing most laymen think it is. Many {{took it as a}} good thing since filing Chapter 11 would get rid of most of the executives who mismanaged the ABA in the first place, as was Gary Ellis Sr.'s opinion. They knew other companies in the industry that were in the same position as the ABA was but came out of it. The Van Doren Rubber Co., the maker of Vans tennis shoes that were then a favorite with BMX racers and freestylers and skateboarders alike, filed for bankruptcy {{a couple of years before}} and eventually came out of it solvent. However, nearly 160 track operators did switch to the USBA, effectively splitting the world of BMX racing three ways.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{an issue}} of funding and equity. Although {{academic}} praise reforms for moving the higher education sector from a unified, centralized and closed system to one that allows openness and diversification, <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> decentralization and semi-privatization has led to further inequity in educational opportunity. Graduate unemployment rates are also a growing concern.|$|R

2500|$|As {{provided}} by the secret treaty, the allies agreed in a [...] "Protocol of Subsidies" [...] that Bolivia had to bear {{the costs of the}} war. The agreement, which bound the tax income for many years, caused resentments and fears in Bolivia, where the deployment of Bolivian forces to Tacna was seen as a help to Peru and, moreover, when they knew that the Bolivian army wouldn't be sent to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru. As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica, they didn't see the expected Peruvian military strength and <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the allied armies. Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza used the Chilean offer of Tacna und Arica for Bolivia in order exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable [...] "Protocolo de Subsidios", which is what he got.|$|E

2500|$|Firing and {{fighting}} began April 14 between Moslems and Armenians, {{which resulted in}} a number of casualties on both sides... the next morning April 15, a fresh outburst of smoke near the girls' school showed that we were threatened by fire...Mr. Maurer and I took a crowbar and an axe to the destroy the wooden porches, shutters and stairways of the houses between the fires and the girls' school...When I first climbed to the roofs near the flames armed Moslems appeared...When <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> I was not firing on them, but had come to work against the flames, they lowered their rifles and assured me with many pledges that I might go unmolested...we repeatedly begged some Armenian young men who were lurking around the street corners shielded from the Moslem fire to put away their arms and come and save the school building... we came back to the school and asked for volunteers, Mr. Rogers came at once... We had thus worked a considerable time without being harmed by the Moslems when the Armenians {{on the other end of}} the street commenced firing on the houses where the looters were at work.
