5000|$|Necking, in {{engineering}} or materials science, is {{a mode of}} <b>tensile</b> <b>deformation</b> where relatively large amounts of strain localize disproportionately in a small region of the material. The resulting prominent decrease in local cross-sectional area provides {{the basis for the}} name [...] "neck". Because the local strains in the neck are large, necking is often closely associated with yielding, a form of plastic deformation associated with ductile materials, often metals or polymers. The neck eventually becomes a fracture when enough strain is applied.|$|E
5000|$|In {{materials}} science, superplasticity is a {{state in}} which solid crystalline material is deformed well beyond its usual breaking point, usually over about 200% during <b>tensile</b> <b>deformation.</b> Such a state is usually achieved at high homologous temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine-grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such as silica glass ("molten glass") and polymers also deform similarly, but are not called superplastic, {{because they are not}} crystalline; rather, their deformation is often described as Newtonian fluid. Superplastically deformed material gets thinner in a very uniform manner, rather than forming a [...] "neck" [...] (a local narrowing) that leads to fracture. Also, the formation of microvoids, which is another cause of early fracture, is inhibited.|$|E

40|$|Adhesion {{properties}} of polymer coatings on metals are {{of great interest}} in various industrial applications, including packaging of food and drinks. Particular interest is focused on polymer-metal interfaces that are subjected to significant deformations during manufacturing process. In this work steel samples laminated with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were subjected to uniaxial <b>tensile</b> <b>deformations</b> followed by annealing treatments. The measurements have demonstrated degradation of adhesion of the metal-polymer interface as the strain introduced by the deformation increased. Moreover, {{it was observed that}} within the geometry used in the experiments <b>tensile</b> <b>deformations</b> of the metal substrate introduced in-plane compressive stresses in the bulk of the coating. After applying a thermal treatment restoration of the adhesion has been achieved. Laser induced delamination technique was used to monitor the adhesion properties. In this technique a coating is subjected to a series of infrared laser pulses with a stepwise increase of intensity. Upon increasing the laser pulse intensity, the pressure which is formed inside the blisters reaches a critical value, resulting in further delamination of the coating. To process the experimental data an elastic model was developed. From the analysis of the experimental data the critical stresses required for the delamination and the practical work of adhesion are derived. The model accounts for the compressive in-plane stress present in the coating of the deformed samples. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
