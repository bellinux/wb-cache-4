50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>milling</b> was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), milling machines evolved into machining centers (milling machines with automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC control, coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|E

40|$|Hardmetal {{products}} are frequently fatigue loaded in service, such as e. g. cutting <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>milling</b> or percussion drills. In the present work, the fatigue behaviour of hardmetals was investigated into the gigacycle range using ultrasonic resonance fatigue testing at 20  kHz in push-pull mode at R = -  1. Liquid cooling was afforded using water with {{addition of a}} corrosion inhibitor. Hourglass shaped specimens were prepared, the surface being ground and polished with subsequent stress-relieving anneal to remove the high compressive residual stresses introduced during grinding. S-N curves with fairly low scatter were obtained, which indicates microstructure-controlled and not defect-controlled failure. Low binder content as well as fine WC grains were found to improve the fatigue endurance strength. In no case, however, a horizontal branch of the S-N curve was observed, i. e. there is no fatigue “limit” at least up to 1010  cycles. The initiation sites were in part difficult to identify; in such cases when the site was clearly visible, decohesion of the binder from large WC grains seems to have caused crack initiation. This further corroborates that microstructural features and not singular defects as e. g. inclusions are the initiation sites, which underlines the high purity of the hardmetal grades used. Based on fracture mechanical consideration a damage diagram was determined allowing to deduce critical defect sizes. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|Sandvik Coromant in Gimo, Sweden, is a world- leading {{supplier}} of tools and know- how for the metal cutting industry. This thesis {{was carried out}} on the maintenance division at the production plant producing <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>milling</b> and drilling. The maintenance division {{is responsible for the}} maintenance of the machinery operating at all eight production units on the tool production plant. This thesis aims to map the value flow and non- value adding activities on the maintenance division and come up with suggestions for improvement. The study only focuses on the organizations work procedures and routines. The thesis began with a current state analysis of the maintenance division to find out how the activities, databases and service technicians interacts in daily operations. A time study showed that the proportion of non-value adding activities in some isolated cases was as low as 30 %. The thesis ended in a root cause analysis, in form of a workshop, which aimed to, with help from the service technicians’ expertise and the researchers’ knowledge of lean production come up with solutions worth implementing on the maintenance division. The root cause analysis resulted in three solutions, which the researchers along with the service technicians sees as simple actions that will reduce the non-value adding time associated with the use, and handling of documentation. The analysis also resulted in sex actions seen as worth implementing, which however is more recourse demanding for the organization.  Sandvik Coromant i Gimo, Sverige, är en världsledande leverantör av verktyg och know- how för metallbearbetningsindustrin.

40|$|The {{formation}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), such as methanol, in kraft mills has been an environmental concern. Methanol is soluble in water and can increase the biochemical oxygen demand. Furthermore, {{it can also be}} released into atmosphere at the process temperatures of kraft mill-streams. The Cluster Rule of the EPA now requires the control of the release of methanol in pulp and paper mills. This research program was conducted to develop a computer simulation <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>mills</b> to predict VOC air emissions. To achieve the objective of the research program, much effort was made in the development of analytical techniques for the analysis of VOC and determination of vapor liquid partitioning coefficient of VOCs in kraft mill-streams using headspace gas chromatography. With the developed analytical tool, methanol formation in alkaline pulping was studied in laboratory to provide benchmark data of the amount of methanol formation in pulping in kraft <b>mills</b> and <b>for</b> the validation of VOC formation and vapor-liquid equilibrium submodels. Several millwide air and liquid samplings were conducted using the analytical tools developed to validate the simulation tool. The VOC predictive simulation model was developed based on the basic chemical engineering concepts, i. e., reaction kinetics, vapor liquid equilibrium, combined with computerized mass and energy balances. Four kraft mill case studies (a continuous digester, two brownstock washing lines, and a pre-evaporator system) are presented and compared with mill measurements.
