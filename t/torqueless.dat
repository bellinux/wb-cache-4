2500|$|A {{suitable}} powerplant for {{a compact}} rotorcraft {{had been identified}} {{in the form of}} the Turbomeca Palouste turbojet engine, for which arrangements had already been independently reached with British firm Blackburn to produce the engine under licence from Turbomeca. Fairey adopted the Palouste engine, which provided compressed air through the hollow rotor blades to the tip jets. According to aviation author Derek Wood: [...] "the Fairy Ultra Light was a masterpiece of simplicity. It dispensed with a tail rotor since the tip-driven main rotor was <b>torqueless</b> and it eliminated the shafts, gears, and clutches associated with piston-engined designs".|$|E
50|$|Anton Flettner was {{an early}} rotary-wing pioneer in Germany, he {{developed}} a <b>torqueless</b> rotor by powering it with small engines fixed directly to the blades driving propellers. this arrangement drove the rotor without transmitting torque (other than bearing friction) to the fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|The Lotus 907 was {{an engine}} {{designed}} and manufactured for automotive applications by Lotus Cars. It was an original design, dual overhead cam, 16 valve all alloy powerplant. It displaced 1973 cc and developed approximately [...] with dual side-draft Dell'Orto carburetors or horizontal Zenith Stromberg carburetors for US cars. It was nicknamed [...] "The <b>Torqueless</b> Wonder" [...] for {{its lack of}} bottom end but good high end horsepower.|$|E

50|$|For takeoff and landing, {{the rotor}} {{was driven by}} tip-jets. The air was {{produced}} by compressors driven through a clutch off the main engines. This was fed through ducting in {{the leading edge of}} the wings and up to the rotor head. Each engine supplied air for a pair of opposite rotors; the compressed air was mixed with fuel and burned. As a <b>torqueless</b> rotor system, no anti-torque correction system was required, though propeller pitch was controlled by the rudder pedals for low-speed yaw control. The propellers provided thrust for translational flight while the rotor autorotated. The cockpit controls included a cyclic and collective pitch lever, as in a conventional helicopter.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the concept, design {{and testing of}} a micro air vehicle rotor testbed capable of independently controlled blade rotation and powered blade flapping. The design, dubbed the "Flotor", combined {{the benefits of a}} conventional MAV helicopter rotor with avian based flapping motion. The Flotor was tested as a conventional rotor, a conventional rotor with powered blade flapping, and a <b>torqueless,</b> freely rotating rotor with powered blade flapping. As a conventional rotor with a maximum figure of merit of 0. 5, the results from the Flotor were similar to previously published experiments. With conventional rotation plus powered blade flapping at up to 8 per rotor revolution at a reduced frequency of 0. 6, the maximum thrust increased by up to 15 % due to delayed stall. The torque required at moderate thrust levels was reduced by up to 30 %. The results from a 2 -D quasi-steady blade element momentum analysis predicted average rotor loads accurately below 20 ° collective. As the first attempt at a <b>torqueless</b> flapping MAV rotor, the Flotor was capable of producing thrust and blade loadings comparable to flying animals, but less than current MAVs...|$|E
40|$|Using <b>torqueless</b> drills, {{recoilless}} hammers, and {{the largest}} robot arm ever built, a futuristic construction team is making history hundreds of miles above the Earth. In this program, NASA's Daniel Goldin; John Pike, of the Federation of American Scientists; and astronauts and cosmonauts describe the challenges faced during {{the initial stages of}} the International Space Station's construction. In addition, visits to the Johnson Space Center's robotics, neutral buoyancy, and virtual reality labs reveal the engineering and training that underpin the project's remarkable successes.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 27 - 28) This project {{consists of}} the structural analysis of a universal joint suspension system used to provide a frictionless, <b>torqueless,</b> disturbance free support for the spinning mass of a tuned rotor strapdown gyro. The analysis assumed 10 G accelerations along the x, y and z axes for computation. Compliances to determine isoelasticity conditions, G-capabilities and buckling critical stress were calculated using finite element techniques and classical mechanics. The minimum G-capabilitiy was computed to be 261 G's (32. 6 gram rotor) along the z or gyro spin axis. With the force due to the rotor in the +z direction the flexures would fail in buckling, the critical stress being 154, 260 psi. Compliances were computed as 46 micro-inches/lb radially and 38 micro-inches/lb axially, an anisoelastic condition. To achieve isoelastic conditions an estimated flexure angle of 57 ?? 15 ??? would be required...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 13 th International Conference, Dynamical Systems - Theory and Applications (DSTA ' 2015), Lodz, Poland, 7 - 10 Dec. 2015 We {{propose a}} model of the Earth’s <b>torqueless</b> precession, the “Chandler wobble,” as a {{self-oscillation}} driven by positive feedback between the wobble and the centrifugal deformation of the portion of the Earth’s mass contained in circulating fluids. The wobble may thus run like a heat engine, extracting energy from heat-powered geophysical circulations whose natural periods would otherwise by unrelated to the wobble’s observed period of about fourteen months. This can explain, more plausibly than previous models based on stochastic perturbations or forced resonance, how the wobble is maintained against viscous dissipation. The self-oscillation is a deterministic process, but stochastic variations in the magnitude and distribution of the circulations may turn off the positive feedback (a Hopf bifurcation), accounting for the occasional extinctions, followed by random phase jumps, seen in the data. This model may have implications for broader questions about the relation between stochastic and deterministic dynamics in complex systems, and the statistical analysis thereof.
