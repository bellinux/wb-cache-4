5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E

5|$|Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintain}} that the dentary is referable to Ferugliotherium and that the p4s of Argentodites and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to Ferugliotherium in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of Ferugliotherium teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) {{do not belong to}} Ferugliotherium, then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (Ferugliotherium and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and Argentodites p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.|$|E
5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but more rewarding because the details on Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass blowing in the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction.

25|$|The {{order of}} the superconducting phase {{transition}} was long a matter of debate.

However, {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase.

25|$|Distinguishing turbidites, contourites, and bottom-current {{modified}} turbidite deposits {{is essential}} for reconstructing the paleoenvironment in deepwater settings.

25|$|Which {{elements}} {{start to}} be counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end. In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency. Where the post-transition metals end depends on where the metalloids or nonmetals start. Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids; other authors treat {{some or all of}} these elements as nonmetals.|$|E
