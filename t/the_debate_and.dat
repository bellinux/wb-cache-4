Without any kind of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature a tower. Hoffmann's design was accepted in 1901, and demolition of the existing buildings began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E

5|$|The BDF and its {{superior}} headquarters, the Seventh Area Army, initially disagreed {{over where}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade should be deployed. In July 1944 the BDF {{believed that the}} Allies were likely to invade northern Borneo in January 1945 or later, and wanted to station the brigade in this area. However, the Seventh Area Army judged that Allied forces {{were more likely to}} attack the Brunei Bay region in western Borneo to support a drive on Singapore. Moreover, the area army believed that {{it would be difficult to}} transfer units from northern to western Borneo due to the island's rugged terrain. The BDF eventually won <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> <b>and</b> the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's units were landed in the Sandakan area of north-east Borneo as they arrived from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>and</b> is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, {{argues that the}} Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> <b>and</b> was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, {{but there is little}} evidence to give such a definite date. Mason argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information.|$|E

5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>and</b> asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1524, five cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug, {{formed an}} alliance, die fünf Orte (the Five States) to defend {{themselves}} from Zwingli's Reformation. They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including John Eck, who had debated Luther in the Leipzig Disputation of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on {{the selection of the}} judging authority, the location of <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> <b>and</b> the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to Baden. Although Zurich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by Johannes Oecolampadius of Basel, a theologian from Württemberg who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, Glarus, Solothurn, Fribourg, and Appenzell as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Zurich supported him.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>and</b> the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of retroversion of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E

Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself was not allowed to ask any questions, but only to present <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>and</b> guarantee respect of the rules.
