40|$|This article {{presents}} a model {{suggesting that the}} pattern of a country's intermediate goods imports affects its level of productivity because a country that imports such goods primarily from <b>technological</b> <b>leaders</b> receives more technology than a country that im-ports primarily from follower countries. The importance of trade patterns in determin-ing technology flows is quantified using industry-level data for machinery goods im-ports and productivity from eight member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development between 1970 and 1991. Three conclusions emerge from this work. First, the eight countries studied appear to benefit more from domestic research and development (R&CD) than from R&D of the average foreign country. Sec-ond, conditional on technology diffusion from domestic R&CD, a country's import com-position matters {{only if it is}} strongly biased toward or away from <b>technological</b> <b>leaders.</b> Third, differences in technology inflows related to the pattern of imports explain about 20 percent of the total variation in productivity growth.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evidence on}} technology diffusion through trade in differentiated intermediate goods. Because intermediates are invented through costly research and development (R&D) investments, employing imported intermediates implies an implicit sharing of the technology that was created in other countries. The model predicts that the import patterns of countries matters for productivity, because a country that imports primarily from <b>technological</b> <b>leaders</b> receives more technology embodied in intermediate goods than another that imports primarily from follower countries. I try to quantify the importance of trade patterns in determining technology flows that affect productivity by using industry level data for machinery goods imports and productivity in eight OECD countries between 1970 - 91. First evidence that these countries benefit more from domestic R&D than from R&D of the average foreign country. Second, conditional on technology diffusion from domestic R&D composition of a country matters, but {{only if it is}} strongly biased towards or away from <b>technological</b> <b>leaders.</b> Third, I estimate that differences in technology inflows related to the countries' patterns of imports explain about 20 % of the total variation in the countries' productivity growth.

50|$|In {{industrial}} policy, Aiginger advocates {{the concept}} of a systemic industrial policy which cooperates with innovation policy, labor market and competition policy with the final goal of serving societal needs. If it is designed strategically, a “green industrial policy” must not reduce price competitiveness but should actually create a competitive advantage. Higher costs for energy or emission at an industrial location should be offset by lower taxes on labor and a better supply of research resources, universities and technical colleges. In this way, a country gains competitive advantages that are important for the future, it becomes a <b>technological</b> <b>leader</b> in renewable energies and energy efficiency, and saves costs associated with making up for environmental damage.|$|E

It is shown that a <b>technological</b> <b>leader</b> has an incentive to locate in isolation only if her advantage exceeds a certain threshold, which is increasing in firms' discount rate, in industry dispersion, and in the intensity of knowledge spillovers.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} of a competitive industry in which a fixed number of firms reduce costs by innovating and by imitating their rivals' technologies. As the firms' technologies gradually improve, industry output expands and price falls. <b>Technological</b> <b>leaders</b> tend to rely on innovations to reduce their costs, whereas the laggards rely more on imitation. Imitation causes technology to spread from the leaders to the followers and forces some convergence of technology among firms as the industry matures.
