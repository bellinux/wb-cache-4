5|$|Written {{language}} {{was introduced to}} Japan around 400 AD {{in the form of}} Chinese books written in Classical Chinese. Japanese interest in Chinese writings and culture gradually increased {{towards the end of the}} 6th century when Japanese rulers sent missions to the mainland for cultural studies, and to bring back books. During circa 300 years in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a large number of Chinese books were brought to Japan. By the 8th century, Chinese works were customarily copied at Japanese libraries to satisfy the demand for education of the male aristocracy. Until the early 17th century, copying in Japan was largely by hand. However, Chinese printed editions of the Song Dynasty were imported following an increased <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> at the start of the Kamakura period (after 1192). The designated manuscripts are either transcriptions of the original works produced in China or in Japan or are Chinese printed editions. The Chinese manuscripts, both handwritten and printed editions, were imported to Japan at the time. The designated treasures are housed in temples, museums, libraries, shrines, universities and in private collections.|$|E

By testing the impact of contemporaneous (lagged) speculative <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> for futures return and conditional volatility, we examine tax and seasonal effects for speculative <b>trading</b> <b>activities.</b> Our empirical results reveal a positive relationship of contemporaneous speculative <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> for daily futures return and conditional volatility, and a negative relationship of lagged speculative <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> and conditional return volatility. Furthermore, we incorporate speculation ratio into Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GJR-GARCH) model and find asymmetric volatility in conditional return of TX futures. In addition, evidence shows that speculative <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> significantly increased in the period following {{the reduction in the}} rate of transaction tax, and significantly decreased on Monday.
