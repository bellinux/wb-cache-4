5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> <b>and</b> carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E

Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward, who drove <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> cooked meals.|$|E
5|$|Hurley finds beer in <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> a {{returned}} Sawyer outside. He learns from Sawyer {{that he and}} Kate escaped but Jack {{is still}} prisoner.

Locke reveals he has compass readings from Mr. Eko's stick. Kate's recruiting of Rousseau seems to fail until she mentions her suspicions about Alex, who helped Kate escape, being Rousseau's daughter.|$|E
5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Minsk in August 1941, Himmler {{witnessed}} an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also decided a transition {{should be made to}} gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos, because removing the dead bodies from <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> <b>and</b> Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E

Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> <b>and</b> the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away.

25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon.

With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults.

25|$|During the summer, the {{occupation}} of Turkish Armenia sponsored a conference to consider emergency measures and adopted plans to form a twenty-thousand-man militia under Andranik to be ready in December 1917.

Admiral Tourville, finding himself with few adversaries in the centre, pushed forward his own leading ships, which Torrington's dispositions had left without opponents, further strengthening the French attack in the van.

25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway.

When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into <b>the</b> <b>van</b> <b>and</b> closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
