5|$|Bacon {{ice cream}} (or bacon-and-egg ice cream) is {{an ice cream}} {{generally}} created by adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture. The concept of bacon ice cream originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke; however, it was eventually created for April Fools' Day. Heston Blumenthal experimented {{with the creation of}} ice cream, making a custard similar to scrambled eggs then adding bacon <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one</b> of his signature dishes. It now appears on dessert menus in other restaurants.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and how to set up a system <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one,</b> and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E

5|$|The Ferus show {{closed on}} August 4, 1962, {{the day before}} Marilyn Monroe's death. Warhol went on to {{purchase}} a Monroe publicity still from the film Niagara, which he later cropped and used <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one</b> of his most well-known works: his painting of Marilyn. Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.|$|E
5|$|The herd {{has been}} studied {{periodically}} since the late 1980s, with researchers recommending various management strategies depending on the focus of their study. Current herd levels {{have been shown to}} {{have a negative effect on}} their environment, and researchers focused on environmental issues recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers. Other researchers, looking at genetic variability, state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also state the herd is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation. The National Park Service has no current management plan for the horses, and their one effort <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one</b> was blocked by Jack Kingston, a Georgia member of the US House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{disputes}} over the modern façade {{of the proposed}} new building, which some felt did not properly match the Jewish Quarter's aesthetic, an Englishman named Charles Clore took the initiative to fund a new design projects. He commissioned Denys Lasdun, who drew up plans between 1978 and 1981 that more closely adhered to the original Hurva. His plans were still considered insufficient, as they were rejected by Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the Minister of Interior, who refused to sign papers enabling construction to begin. No further progress was made and when Clore, who had wished to see the synagogue completed in his lifetime, died, his daughter provided funds <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one</b> of the few open spaces in the Jewish Quarter adjacent to the Hurva.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>one</b> seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E
