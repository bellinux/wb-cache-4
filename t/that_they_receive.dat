5|$|On 19 June 2017, Sparagna {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Portuguese club Boavista. It was reported that Marseille agreed to terminate Sparagna's contract prematurely in order for him to join Boavista, with the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> a percentage of any fee received by the Portuguese club for his future sale. He made his debut for the club on 27 August, starting in a 1–0 win over Desportivo Aves which saw Boavista register their first win of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has had {{occurrences of}} {{actors and actresses}} {{nominated}} for two different Academy Awards in acting categories in a single year, with the first instance in 1938. Provided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> enough votes from the Academy in both categories to earn a nomination, there are no restrictions on actors being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor or actresses being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in any given year. The sole rule with regard to multiple nominations is that an actor or actress cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance. This rule was introduced in 1944 after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor nomination and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Going My Way.|$|E

The Commission further recommended the Patriarch, Mar Eshai Shimunbe, be given full authority over his people.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a decline of hunting {{partially}} {{due to the fact}} that young people lack the skills to survive off the land. They are no longer skilled in hunting like their ancestors and are growing more accustomed to the Qallunaat ("white people") food <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> from the south. The high costs of hunting equipment—snowmobiles, rifles, sleds, camping gear, gasoline, and oil—is also causing a decline in families who hunt for their meals.|$|E

25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> during winemaking. There is on-going study into {{the health benefits of}} wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> today more than money {{they get in the}} future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} could {{give rise to}} {{neuronal}} or glial progenitors, {{depending on the type}} of signals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> - gliogenic or neurogenic signals, respectively. Glial progenitor cells could differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. However, lineage commitment of neural progenitors involves the suppression of alternative fates. Therefore, vertebrate proneural genes promote neuronal fates and simultaneously inhibit glial fates. For example, the downregulation of the expression of proneural gene ngn2 in the spinal cord represses oligodendrocyte differentiation. In the context of restricted glial progenitors, proneural genes might have functions that are distinct from their better-characterized role in lineage specification, perhaps in the differentiation of glial lineages.|$|E

25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount of mail they receive each day may notice <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|E
25|$|When the 1970 Roman Missal allowed laypeople {{to receive}} both species {{of bread and}} wine, it insisted that priests should use the {{occasion}} to teach the faithful the Catholic doctrine on the form of Communion, as affirmed by the Council of Trent: they were first to be reminded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> the whole Christ when they participate in the sacrament even under one kind alone, and thus are not then deprived of any grace necessary for salvation. The circumstances in which this was permitted were initially very restricted, but were gradually extended. Regular distribution of Communion under both kinds requires {{the permission of the}} bishop, but bishops in some countries have given blanket permission for the administration of Communion in this way.|$|E
25|$|Sneha Deepthi {{was born}} in 1996 in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Although not {{interested}} {{in any kind of}} sport in her childhood, she started playing gully cricket along with her father and brother. At the insistence of her fatheran employee of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, she started to play the game seriously, and by the time when she reached fourth grade she started taking coaching classes. Her father enrolled Sneha Deepthi and her younger sister Ramya Deepika to a summer coaching camp. The family shifted from Ukkunagaram (Visakhapatnam Steel Plant) to Pothinamallayya Palem, another suburb of Visakhapatnam, in order to ensure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> proper training under their coach Krishna Rao and make use of the facilities at the Dr. Y.S.

25|$|Title {{insurance}} {{is available in}} many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, Korea and throughout Europe. However, while {{a substantial number of}} properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share of U.S. title insurers' revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders. The U.S. companies involved buy title insurance to obtain the security of a U.S. insurer backing up the evidence of title <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> from the other country's land registration system, and payment of legal defense costs if the title is challenged.|$|E
25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{employees}} in the control tower worked for the Civil Aviation Administration. In October 1991, they went on strike demanding <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> better working conditions. However, the airport owner and the Civil Aviation Administration could not agree on who had the responsibility {{to build a new}} tower. Since 1987, the airport operator kept all landing fees, while the Civil Aviation Administration collected the navigation fees. The air force stated that it had no need for an upgrade to the airport, and was not willing to pay for further investments. The Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the Civil Aviation Administration had previously decided that the state would not give subsidies to Sandefjord Airport, and that such investments must be carried by the operating company. Plans were made, but construction was stopped by the military in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> a license within a few years.|$|E
