40|$|ABSTRACT. Our {{investigation}} explored a pedagogy for supervision {{through a}} case study of one prospective middle school mathematics <b>teacher</b> during her <b>student</b> teaching semester. Classroom observations by the university supervisor, teaching episode interviews between <b>the</b> supervisor and <b>student</b> <b>teacher,</b> and focused journal reflections by <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> were coordinated to challenge <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> existing models of teaching. The emerging pedagogy of the teaching episodes, a central focus of this study, was characterized by (a) the use of open-ended questions that centered <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in <b>the</b> process of sense making; (b) a shift away from the supervisor’s direct, authoritative evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> practice; (c) a sustained focus throughout supervision derived from <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> classroom experiences; and (d) an effort to maintain sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> zone of proximal development. We found our approach to be coincident with the notion of instructional conversation (IC) advanced by Gallimore and Goldenberg (1992). The nature of the teaching episodes seemed to open <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> zone of proximal development so that her practice of teaching could be mediated with the assistance of a more knowing other...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of the mentor’s approach and <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes, measured by his perceived knowledge productivity. In a comparative case-based design including 12 couples of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and their mentors we compared <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived knowledge productivity for groups based on the experienced mentor’s approach in the mentoring conversation and <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor. The findings of this study suggest that: •	The mentor’s approach in the mentoring conversation does not significantly influence <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived knowledge productivity. We compared two approaches: a scaffolding and prescriptive ‘high road’ approach and an exploring ‘low road’ approach. •	<b>Student</b> <b>teachers</b> who have a positive relationship with their mentor have higher perceived knowledge productivity. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor was measured on three variables: <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> satisfaction with his mentor, experienced effect of the mentoring and closeness in the mentoring relationship. Our findings indicate that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> and mentor influences <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes. Therefore more attention in matching <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and mentors is desirable. A high closeness in the relationship also has a positive influence on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes. It would be recommendable to reconsider the detached way a teacher educator is currently mentoring his <b>student</b> <b>teacher.</b> Although no significant influence for mentor’s approach to perceived knowledge productivity is found, we did see slightly higher scores for <b>the</b> group of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> who experienced a ‘low road’ approach. This suggests that our ‘low road’ might facilitate learning. If this finding can be generalized to all mentoring, mentors can deliberately use this approach to increase <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> learning outcomes. We also found that the experimental model on mentor’s approach used in this study might not be correct or complete. We suggest improving the instrument used to measure the mentor’s approach by adding a category ‘explanation of practical knowledge’ and suggest changing the level of measurement from propositions to paragraphs or turns taken in the conversation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{evolving}} event-structured knowledge of one <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in a second grade classroom containing a diverse population of students. His understandings, interpretations, and reflections were documented before, during, and after enactment of units of content in the classroom. Weekly interviews designed to elicit <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher's</b> "well-remembered events" provided the primary data for the study. In addition, daily observations by the researcher supplemented analysis of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher's</b> interpretations. Interviews with the cooperating teacher to establish an understanding of the context in which <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> was learning to teach completed data collection. Findings indicated that <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> faced major difficulties in the areas of instructional time and unit context. Based on the demands of <b>the</b> curriculum, <b>students,</b> and cooperating <b>teacher</b> and his interpretations of difficulties encountered, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> concluded that <b>the</b> second grade curriculum was above grade level, that it was constraining on planning and teaching, and that it contained discrepancies. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> resolved these difficulties by moving <b>students</b> back in <b>the</b> curriculum or by condensing or eliminating portions of the curriculum before and during the enactment of content. Analysis of the data suggests that other factors may have contributed to the problems faced by <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in learning to teach. For example, he reported having limited knowledge of the curriculum as well as teaching methods. These limitations may have affected the struggles he experienced as he learned, represented, and enacted the curriculum with a group of students in a complex environment...|$|R

40|$|Experienced {{teachers}} are often perceived as skillful performers of improvisational activities in <b>the</b> classroom. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> has a narrower basis {{for carrying out}} the activity with the same level and quality of improvisation {{due to the lack}} of experience and repertoire. A key question is: Does <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> improvise at all? Furthermore, how can this improvisational activity be described? This study aims at describing improvisational teacher knowledge and skills. The study uses principles from an exercise within improvisational theater performance. Furthermore, the study examines how <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and experienced teachers use teacher knowledge and skills in project based practice. The practice is an area where student creativity is fostered to a larger degree. The study attempts to explain how <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and experienced teachers apply this individually, but also in relation to each other. The research questions are as follows: 1. How can one describe improvisational teacher knowledge and skills in music pedagogic practice? 2. How do <b>teachers</b> and <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> use improvisational teacher knowledge and skills in project-organized practice? Findings show that experienced teachers use structures and frameworks effectively to create an open space where the pupil in guidance with the teacher, are given the opportunity to discuss curricular goals and conceptual comprehension. The teacher applies different approaches and examples to progress the conversation, so that <b>the</b> <b>students</b> can develop their own ideas in a creative process. The dialogue is open for <b>student</b> input, and <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> progress the conversation based on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> input. By doing this, the teacher can control the conversation through an open dialogue guide. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> lacks both experience and repertoire to teach with the same level of flexibility and structures as the experienced teacher. A more one-way 4 conversation dominates <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> teaches. Generally, it is observed that <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> controls <b>the</b> conversation with a closed dialogue guide, because the conversation does to a much lesser degree allow for input and adaptive development. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> does, however, show tendencies towards an open dialogue guide but stalling at an early phase of the conversation. The discussion suggests that the teacher education needs to incorporate the term ¨improvisation¨, viewed as an effective teaching activity, towards conceptual knowledge. The term improvisation, and improvisation as an activity, should be a subject that is both discussed and exercised in practice...|$|R
