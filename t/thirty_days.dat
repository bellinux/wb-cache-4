5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within <b>thirty</b> <b>days.</b> McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the <b>thirty</b> <b>days</b> before releasing Stone.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{specification}} for closure torques that can be used on a production line. The specification must assure that torque will remain adequate to effect a leak free seal while resulting in an ultimate removal that can be achieved by the consumer without difficulty. The challenging aspect of this study is the complexity introduced by using two closure colorants, two distinctly different product formulations, and a capping mechanism that operates at a variable speed of up to three hundred bottles per minute. The research and testing involves dimensional evaluation of bottles and closures, line testing at low, medium, and high production speeds with wet and dry bottle finishes, and five minute, twenty-four hour, seven <b>day,</b> and <b>thirty</b> <b>day</b> removal torque testing. Several conclusions are drawn from the study. First, the bottle finishes must be kept free of product on the filling line. Second, torque decay decreases with time throughout the <b>thirty</b> <b>day</b> period. Third, the two colorants used for the closures do not affect the dimensions or torque values. Finally, the specified removal torque ranges used for production must be associated with the line speed at the time of application...|$|R

In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights.

Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis.
