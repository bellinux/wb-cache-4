5|$|After nearly 40 {{minutes of}} brutal, close-quarters fighting, {{the two sides}} broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of Helena and senior {{surviving}} U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage. Admiral Abe had one battleship (Kirishima), one light cruiser (Nagara), and four destroyers (Asagumo, Teruzuki, Yukikaze, and Harusame) with only light damage and four destroyers (Inazuma, Ikazuchi, Murasame, and Samidare) with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (Helena) and one destroyer (Fletcher) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting {{what he saw}} {{was a lack of}} drive among <b>the</b> <b>troops,</b> <b>and</b> even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning the respect of <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> succeeding in reducing {{the impact of their}} more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} to inspect <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> to report {{back with the}} condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Each evening, Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched {{a battalion of}} the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem {{as well as a}} contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of the debacle on the morale of <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.|$|E

5|$|He {{was made}} {{commander-in-chief}} in the Leeward Islands Station {{and given the}} task of transporting a large troop convoy. Twice he attempted the crossing of the Atlantic, and twice he was forced back by severe gales which ravaged his fleet and wrecked {{a number of the}} merchant ships in the convoy. He made a third attempt in 1796, and succeeded in shepherding the fleet to its destination. He was then active in using <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> his naval forces to capture the islands of Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenada, before returning to England. He was made second in command at the Cape of Good Hope in 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year, and he died while in command there in November 1798.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sir Archibald Murray, the Imperial Commander in Chief of Egypt, {{partially}} {{addressed the}} threat of von Kressenstein's forces to the Suez Canal by organising the defences into three sectors. No. 1 (Southern) sector, with its headquarters at Suez, covered the area from Suez to Kabrit, No. 2 (Central) sector, with its headquarters at Ismailia, covered the area from Kabrit to Ferdan, and No. 3 (Northern) sector, with its headquarters at Port Said, covered the area from Ferdan to Port Said. The No. 3 sector also had an advanced headquarters at Kantara. To support these forward defences, the British Empire improved their lines of communication by doubling the single railway line that ran from Cairo to the Suez Canal, and also pumped water from the River Nile along the Sweet Water Canal to supply <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> the towns on the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of}} the transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.|$|E

While his column was passing the Soviet airfields {{near the city of}} Brody, German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground. Several hours later, they arrived in Ternopil, having been strafed twice by the planes. Three days after the invasion, the plans for the counter-offensive were implemented, but disorder engulfed <b>the</b> <b>troops,</b> <b>and</b> the counter-attack collapsed.
