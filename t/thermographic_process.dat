40|$|Transient thermography, {{which employs}} pulse surface heating of an {{inspected}} component followed by {{acquisition of the}} thermal decay stage, is gaining wider acceptance {{as a result of}} its remoteness and rapidness. Flaws in the component s material may induce a thermal contrast in surface thermograms. An important issue in transient thermography is estimating the depth of a subsurface flaw from the thermal response. This improves the quantitative ability of the thermal evaluation: from one scan it is possible to locate regions of anomalies in thickness (caused by corrosion) and estimate the implications of the flaw on the integrity of the structure. Our research focuses on thick composite aircraft components. A long square heating pulse and several minutes observation period are required to receive an adequate thermal response from such a component. Application of various time-related informative parameters of the thermal response for depth estimation is discussed. A three-dimensional finite difference model of heat propagation in solids in Cartesian coordinates is used to simulate the <b>thermographic</b> <b>process.</b> Typical physical properties of polymer graphite composites are assumed for the model...|$|E
5000|$|Perylene dyes {{are useful}} for their intense visible light absorption, high stability, {{electron}} accepting ability, and unity quantum yields. Due to these properties, they are actively researched in academia for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, <b>thermographic</b> <b>processes,</b> energy-transfer cascades, light-emitting diodes, and near-infrared-absorbing systems. [...] A bathochromic shift of about 100 nm is recorded per additional naphthalene unit.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} form a raised three {{dimensional}} image makes possible the use of modified processes, inks and substrates in fine art work, such as children’s books, business cards, postcards, and special type printing processes. If the raised image attains the required height and firmness, {{it can be used}} in printing of Braille characters. Production of three dimensional (3 D) images on a substrate can be accomplished by old fashioned embossing procedures, a process using hectographic or spirit duplicating masters, or raised Xerographic printing with thermally intumesced electroscopic powders. It may also be done employing three-dimensional imaging paper with randomly distributed fibers with uniformly dispersed unexpanded synthetic thermoplastic polymeric microspheres, <b>thermographic</b> <b>processes,</b> special printing processes, which work by building parts of light curable photo-polymer in layers, or heat transfer printing with thermally-expandable ink layer. Results from our laboratory show a modified formula of hot melt ink {{that can be used in}} 3 D thermal wax printing process to create raised images on the substrates. An extensive study of thermal behavior of the components of proposed phase change ink has been carried out...|$|R
50|$|Engraving is {{a process}} that {{requires}} a design to be cut into a plate made of a relatively hard material. It is a technology with a long history and requires significant skill and experience. The finished plate is usually covered in ink, and then the ink is removed from all of the un-etched portions of the plate. The plate is then pressed into paper under substantial pressure. The result is a design that is slightly raised {{on the surface of the}} paper and covered in ink. Due to the cost of the process and expertise required, many consumers opt for <b>thermographic</b> printing, a <b>process</b> that results in a similarly raised print surface, but through different means at less cost.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to <b>process</b> <b>thermographic</b> image sequences recorded after pulsed excitation {{in order to achieve}} noise reduction of data {{and at the same time}} a reduction of the necessary storage space. In contrast to existing methods like TSR, the algorithm does work on adjacent pixels both in space and time. The filter parameters are controlled by a physical model, based on the thermal broadening behavior of an instantaneous point source. Input parameters are the thermal diffusivity of the material and the maximum depth of observation. The results show efficient data smoothing, in particular at late times, where weak contrasts have to be evaluated. The data volume is compressed by 90 %...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method is}} based on the following environmental assumptions: (1) the indoor building environment is assumed to have a quasi-steady-state condition of heat transfer during the <b>thermographic</b> inspection <b>process.</b> This is consistent with all recent works on non-destructive measurement of thermal properties (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]; Ham and Golparvar-Fard [2014]; Madding [2008]). For achieving a quasi-steady-state condition of heat transfer, the building envelopes were not exposed to direct solar radiations and wind loadings as the inspections were conducted before sunrise on a non-windy and cloudy day. This minimizes the influence of the convective heat loss and the surface temperature rise on the exterior of building envelopes. As such, the possible increase in building surface temperatures caused by the release of the absorbed solar energy throughout a day was minimized; 2) it was further assumed that the heat transfer between the indoor surfaces and the thermal camera lens is due to thermal convection and radiation. This assumption is consistent with prior works (Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]; Ham and Golparvar-Fard [2014]; Madding [2008]). In addition, the building interior spaces were heated for a few hours prior to thermographic inspections, which allowed to clearly capture the as-is heat transfer conditions through building façades during the winter season.|$|R
30|$|Today, {{building}} practitioners widely use Infrared (IR) thermography {{to identify}} {{sources of energy}} loss in building envelopes. The IR thermography –which detects and measures heat variations from surfaces in a non-destructive manner– is particularly known for its usefulness for identifying thermal defects. Nonetheless, current <b>thermographic</b> inspection <b>processes</b> have several inefficiencies. For example, thermal images captured using consumer-level IR thermal cameras typically have low spatial resolutions (160 × 120 or 320 × 240 pixel) and small fields-of-view compared to their digital counterparts (> 1 megapixel). As a result, sensing thermal performance data for buildings, even a single room, requires large numbers of thermal images (e.g., ~ 300 to 400 thermal images for around 4 m × 5 m room based on experiments). Considering significantly large collections of 2 D thermal images {{that need to be}} manually analyzed for the purpose of assessing thermal conditions, their direct application for practical building diagnostics can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In order to improve the process of sensing thermal performance using raw 2 D thermal images, several studies (Borrmann et al. [2013]; [Ham and Golparvar-Fard 2013]; Lagüela et al. [2013]; Wang et al. [2013]) have recently focused on developing methods for 3 D thermal modeling of building environments by leveraging digital photogrammetry or laser scanning, and promising results have been reported.|$|R
40|$|Model-based {{analysis}} and inversion of thermography data relies on knowledge of thermal diffusivities. Through-thickness diffusivity is readily measured using the flash method [1]. In composite materials, lateral diffusivities may be drastically {{different from the}} through-thickness values, {{but there is no}} comparable simple and standard approach for measuring those lateral thermal diffusivities. Welch, Heath, and Winfree [2] proposed a technique based on laser line pulse excitation, but that approach requires a reasonably powerful laser and thermal camera with the concomitant costs and safety requirements. In this presentation, we show a simple and low cost (but not entirely nondestructive) system and method for in-plane thermal diffusivity measurement for composites. It is conceptually similar to the flash method but uses a mechanical heat source (belt sander) rather than a flash and multiple layers of the specimen are laminated together and encased in insulating foam. A thermistor measures the temperature and embedded software performs a curve-fitting (<b>thermographic</b> signal reconstruction) <b>process</b> to measure the inflection point of the temperature-time curve [3] and therefore the thermal diffusivity. The device is built from open source hardware and software, with a materials cost well under $ 200 (not including the belt sander) ...|$|R
40|$|Lock-in {{thermography}} (LIT) is {{a sensitive}} imaging technique generally used in engineering and materials science (e. g. detecting defects in composite materials). However, it {{has recently been}} expanded for investigating the heating power of nanomaterials, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Here we implement LIT as a rapid and reproducible method that can evaluate the heating potential of various sizes of SPIONs under an alternating magnetic field (AMF), {{as well as the}} limits of detection for each particle size. SPIONs were synthesized via thermal decomposition and stabilized in water via a ligand transfer <b>process.</b> <b>Thermographic</b> measurements of SPIONs were made by stimulating particles of varying sizes and increasing concentrations under an AMF. Furthermore, a commercially available SPION sample was included as an external reference. While the size dependent heating efficiency of SPIONs has been previously described, our objective was to probe the sensitivity limits of LIT. For certain size regimes it was possible to detect signals at concentrations as low as 0. 1 mg Fe/mL. Measuring at different concentrations enabled a linear regression analysis and extrapolation of the limit of detection for different size nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{need for}} {{improving}} automotive assembly, energy-efficiency, performance, durability and quality is intensifying as customer demands and competitive pressures drive the industry toward unrelenting improvements in energy conservation, cost, quality and speed to market, without compromising the vehicle capacity, performance, appearance and affordability to which North Americans have become accustomed. This presentation describes {{the need for}} and the {{development and use of}} infrared detection methods to assure the joint quality of friction welds in thermoplastic assemblies and to monitor adhesive bond-joint curing in metal assemblies. Some remaining barriers to the wider applications of this technology in the quality assurance of joints in automotive body structures will also be presented as indicators of further research and development opportunities. Introduction: The use of infrared (IR) detection to monitor surface temperatures {{in order to determine the}} progress and state of thermally dependent processes is a well-known nondestructive inspection (NDI) technology in the automotive industry. It was an easy and short technology “leap ” from the use of thermography for preventative-maintenance health monitoring of industrial machinery to use of <b>thermographic</b> NDI for <b>process</b> monitoring of manufacturing processes.

40|$|The {{elastomeric}} anti-trauma pad (EA-TP) {{based on}} shear thickening fluid (STF) has been developed. Dynamic oscillatory shear experiment {{was conducted at}} constant strain amplitude of 5 %. STF composed of 25 % of volume fraction of 7 nm Fumed Silica, dispersed in polypropylene glycol with molar mass 400 gmol− 1 shows elastic properties in entire investigated range of the frequency. Ballistic tests of EA-TP with 7. 62 mm × 39 mm PS bullets were performed according to the PN-V- 87000 : 2011 standard. The studies revealed about 60 % reduction of the average backface signature depth (BSD) for the EA-TP, {{when compared to the}} nowadays commonly used soft insert. The ATR-FTIR analysis confirmed slight impact of the elevated temperature and air (oxygen) on the chemical degradation of the EA-TP surface. The UV-VIS spectroscopy has allowed to notice colour deviation of the aged samples towards green and yellow, as well as lack of dye resistance to accelerated aging <b>process.</b> <b>Thermographic</b> analysis has shown no visible changes of the EA-TP surface and sub-surface during accelerated aging process. The aforementioned small changes on the surface of EA-TP did not affect the ballistic properties of composite armour.

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} {{models from}} different manufacturers have already structural components made of CFRP (fuselage and wing shell, rudder, flaps), {{which must be}} reinforced by special profiles. In {{the state of the}} art processes, these profiles are pre-bonded with conduction- and convection-based heating methods, which are time consuming and inefficient. At the Center for Lightweight Production Technology (ZLP) of the German Aerospace Centre in Stade a new method for pre-bonding was patented and the foundation for industrialization was laid by extensive research. By using inductive heating, the process time for the pre-bonding of stringers is reduced from 30 - 45 seconds to 3 - 5 seconds per adhesive point. In cooperation with Premium Aerotec GmbH the applicability to Airbus A 350 fuselage panel manufacturing was investigated. A comparison to ultrasonic heating and {{the state of the art}} pre-bonding method as well as the development and testing of automation concepts were performed. While the technique reached the next phase on the way to series production several findings emerged, which may require further process adaptions. To control the temperature on the bottom side repeatable and independent from stringer type or side attempts to regulate the process were made. Based on optical temperature measurements on the stringer’s top surface, the induction generator power was adjusted using different algorithms. Then several experiments were performed to establish a relation between top and bottom side temperatures in fast <b>processes.</b> <b>Thermographic</b> analysis showed that hotspots occurred during the heating process of A 350 stringers, which worsened the temperature homogeneity and shrunk the process window. The problem was considered to be related to the junctions between different plies and could be solved by using an alternative induction coil design. Additionally, this new coil design is supposed to increase overall temperature homogeneity and decrease material dependencies significantly. It makes the process much more controllable. This paper summarizes the methods used to confront inductive heating with ultrasonic and the state of the art technology. Furthermore the automation concepts and thoughts on quality assurance are presented. Finally it shares the insights and results of the performed experiments as well as the future focus of research...|$|R
