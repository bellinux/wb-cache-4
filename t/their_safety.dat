5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E

They also defeated Atlético Madrid on aggregate before being knocked out by Sporting Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were too rough to ensure <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The sixteen contestants {{were divided}} into two tribes of eight: Tagi and Pagong. Both tribes fared equally in {{challenges}} but differed in organisational structure. Pagong was dominated by the younger, more carefree members, whereas four contestants on Tagi—Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan—formed an alliance, choosing to vote as a voting bloc to ensure <b>their</b> <b>safety.</b> When ten players remained—five from each tribe—the tribes merged into one, named Rattana. The alliance strategy proved to be successful, and the four took advantage of the other contestants' lack of voting strategy to gain dominance. There was dissension in the alliance as Kelly was deemed untrustworthy, but she won four consecutive immunity challenges and was ineligible for elimination.|$|E
