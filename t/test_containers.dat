The purpose of the GGE is to determine the different quantities and types of gases that would be produced and the gas-generation rates that would develop if brine were introduced to CH-TRU waste under post-closure WIPP disposal room conditions. The experiment requires that a prescribed matrix of CH-TRU waste be placed in a 7. 5 liter <b>test</b> <b>container.</b> After loaded with the CH-TRU waste, brine and inoculum mixtures (consisting of salt and microbes indigenous to the Carlsbad, New Mexico region) are added to the waste.

As a result, BCT obtained from testing at standard TAPPI environment may be inadequate to protect the products inside from damages during real-life distribution. The corrugated containers users need to understand this concept in order to design a proper corrugated containers at a cost-efficient price that can retain BCT in these extreme {{temperature and humidity}} changes environments. Wax curtain coating {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques to retain BCT of corrugated containers that are distributed in short-term high humidity environment, and usually found in the fresh produce, poultry and meat industries. In this study, standard and wax curtain coated corrugated containers were top-loaded with two different safety factors and conditioned in three different cyclic environments. Every 24 hours, moisture contents and heights of these loaded <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> were determined to investigate life-span and relationship between moisture content change and reduction in height. In addition, unloaded standard and wax curtain coated corrugated containers were conditioned in three different cyclic and constant environments. The reduction in BCT of these unloaded <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> in each cyclic and constant environment was investigated after the loaded <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> in that cyclic environment reached the critical deflection. The results of the experiment showed that there was a notable difference in reduction in BCT of the standard unloaded <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> after exposure to every cyclic and constant environments, but not of the wax curtain coated unloaded <b>test</b> <b>containers.</b> The life-span of loaded wax curtain coated <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> were also greater than of loaded standard <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> in every cyclic environment.

40|$|Underground {{structures}} {{perform an}} important role in transportation systems in many seismically active regions around the world, but empirical data regarding the seismic behavior of these structures is limited. This research works towards filling that empirical gap through the use of scale model shake table testing. Underground seismic soil-structure interaction (USSSI) effects were investigated for a stiff rectangular tunnel cross-section embedded within soft clay. San Francisco Young Bay Mud was used as a prototype soil for developing a scale model soil mixture consisting of kaolinite, bentonite, class C fly ash, and water. A single cell Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) cut-and-cover subway tunnel was used as the prototype for the 10 th scale model subway cross-section. A flexible walled <b>test</b> <b>container</b> originally developed for a pile study at UC Berkeley was modified for use at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The flexible container allows for close approximation of one-dimensional (1 D) free-field site response by significantly limiting the rigidity of the boundary conditions and allowing the soil to deform under simple shear. The study was conducted over two shake table testing phases: Phase I consisted of shaking a model soil column to evaluate the ability of the <b>test</b> <b>container</b> to produce adequate 1 D free-field site response, and Phase II tests explored the horizontal racking distortion of a shallow rectangular tunnel cross-section subjected to strong transverse ground shaking. Phase I test results and comparison with SHAKE models indicate that the <b>test</b> <b>container</b> can sufficiently mimic 1 D free-field conditions, specifically for the primary shear deformation mode. Similarly, the equivalent linear soil-structure interaction code FLUSH was found to adequately model site response for the Phase II soil-structure system. Comparison of recorded horizontal racking distortions of the model structure with those from numerical modeling suggest that current simplified design methods may overestimate distortions to some degree for cases similar to those examined in this research. Overall, the flexible wall <b>testing</b> <b>container</b> shows promise as a viable means for gaining further insight into USSSI topics, as well as various other geotechnical and soil-structure interaction problems...|$|R

The support and control systems used to operate and maintain the Gas Generation Experiment (GGE) include the following: glovebox atmosphere and pressure control, test container support, glovebox operation support, and gas supply and exhaust systems. The glovebox atmosphere and pressure control systems consist of various components used to control both the pressure {{and quality of the}} argon atmosphere inside the glovebox. The glovebox pressure is maintained by three separate pressure control systems. The primary pressure control system is designed to maintain the glovebox at a negative pressure with the other two control systems serving as redundant safety backups. The quality of the argon atmosphere is controlled using a purifying bed system that removes oxygen and moisture. Glovebox atmosphere contaminants that are monitored on a continuous or periodic basis include moisture, oxygen, and nitrogen. The gas generation experiment requires the <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> to be filled with brine, leak tested, maintained at a constant temperature, and the gas head space of the test container sampled on a periodic basis.

This project proposes a buck conversion method with inrush current limiting circuit designed for connecting the <b>test</b> <b>container’s</b> energy consumers to the 380 V DC main bus, in order to achieve optimum operation, in terms of near peak efficiency and safety. Within the framework of this study, the “Femtogrid” system, which is the electricity system used by the <b>test</b> <b>container,</b> is explained and simulated. Additionally, the operation of the buck (step-down) converter and the boost (step-up) converter, that are the main elements of “Femtogrid” system, are studied and their control methods are analyzed. Moreover, some common electronic devices are tested with DC and AC input voltage, revealing important information regarding their behavior in normal and standby mode. An even better performance of some devices when running on DC is observed. The experiments showed high inrush currents due to the charging of the input capacitors during turn-on. Therefore, an inrush current limiter (ICL) is necessary in order to protect the system components from damage. The buck converter topology proposed in this project is the LLC resonant buck converter topology, which holds features like very high efficiency, isolation and small number of components. The ICL consists of a MOSFET in combination with some passive elements that can drive the MOSFET in such a way that the inrush current of the circuit can be limited by controlling the gate charge characteristic of the MOSFET. A prototype was simulated, built and tested. The simulations showed that the ICL should be able to limit the inrush current at a very low level.

40|$|The {{potential}} for generation of gases in transuranic (TRU) waste by microbial activity, chemical interactions, corrosion, and radiolysis was {{addressed in the}} Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-West) Gas-Generation Experiments (GGE). Data was collected over several years by simulating the conditions in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) after the eventual intrusion of brine into the repository. Fourteen <b>test</b> <b>containers</b> with various actual TRU waste immersed in representative brine were inoculated with WIPP-relevant microbes, pressurized with inert gases, and kept in an inert-atmosphere environment for several years to provide estimates of the gas-generation rates {{that will be used}} in computer models for future WIPP Performance Assessments. Modest temperature variations occurred during the long-term ANL-West experiments. Although the experiment temperatures always remained well within the experiment specifications, the small temperature variation was observed to affect the test container pressure far more than had been anticipated. In fact, the pressure variations were so large, and seemingly erratic, {{that it was impossible to}} discern whether the data was even valid and whether the long-term pressure trend was increasing, decreasing, or constant. The result was that no useful estimates of gas-generation rates could be deduced from the pressure data. Several initial attempts were made to quantify the pressure fluctuations by relating these to the measured temperature variation, but none was successful. The work reported here carefully analyzed the pressure measurements to determine if these were valid or erroneous data. It was found that a thorough consideration of the physical phenomena that were occurring can, in conjunction with suitable gas laws, account quite accurately for the pressure changes that were observed. Failure of the earlier attempts to validate the data was traced to the omission of several phenomena, the most important being the variation in the headspace volume caused by thermal expansion and contraction within the brine and waste. A further effort was directed at recovering useful results from the voluminous archived pressure data. An analytic methodology to do this was developed. This methodology was applied to each archived pressure measurement to nullify temperature and other effects to yield an adjusted pressure, from which gas-generation rates could be calculated. A review of the adjusted-pressure data indicated that generated-gas concentrations among these containers after approximately 3. 25 years of test operation ranged from zero to over 17, 000 ppm by volume.

To dispose of the waste without removing the brine from the <b>test</b> <b>containers,</b> LANL added commercially available cross-linked polyacrylate granules to absorb the 190 liters of brine in each container, making the waste compliant for shipping to the WIPP in a Standard Waste Box (SWB). Prior to performing the absorption, LANL and the manufacturer of the absorbent conducted laboratory and field tests to determine the ratio of absorbent to brine that would fully absorb the liquid. Bench scale tests indicated a ratio of 10 parts Castile brine to one part absorbent and 6. 25 parts Brine A to one part absorbent. The minimum ratio of absorbent to brine was sought because headspace in the containers was limited. However, full scale testing revealed that the ratio should be adjusted to be about 15 % richer in absorbent. Additional testing showed that the absorbent would not apply more than 13. 8 kPa pressure {{on the walls of the}} vessel and that the absorbent would still function normally at that pressure and would not degrade in the approximately 5 e- 4 Sv/hr radioactive field produced by the waste. Heat generation from the absorption was minimal. The in situ absorption created a single waste stream of 8 SWBs whereas the least complicated alternate method of disposal would have yielded at least an additional 2600 liters of mixed low level liquid waste plus about two cubic meters of mixed low level solid waste, and would have resulted in higher risk of radiation exposure to workers.

Three aggregates were tested in combination with three cements and three fly ashes available in Iowa. Thirty-six combinations were made and tested over a six-month period. The conclusions were: (1) the new style ASTM containers were much more effective than the containers used by the Iowa DOT in the past; (2) some mixes with 15 percent Class C fly ash had increased expansion over comparative mixes without fly ash; and (3) the Oreapolis # 8 pit did not appear to have an alkali-silica reaction problem based on this testing and earlier reported testing...|$|E
