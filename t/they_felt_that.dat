5|$|In 2006, PTC {{requested}} that the FCC deny broadcast license renewal for Salt Lake City CBS station KUTV because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the broadcast of the Without a Trace episode that was ruled indecent violated community standards and that CBS failed {{to take action to}} reduce indecent content following the FCC fines. Subsequently, CBS agreed to pay the FCC $300,000 to settle the KUTV license challenge.|$|E
5|$|The NSPCC {{reported}} that the Savile scandal had resulted {{in an increase in}} overall reports of sexual abuse by 81%. This was measured by comparing the years immediately before and after broadcasting of the Exposure documentary. A subsequent NSPCC report was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and published in January 2014. It reported on interviews with 26 individuals, a number of whom were abused in hospitals. Upon reporting abuse to staff at the time, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> their concerns were not treated sincerely.|$|E
5|$|The team {{created new}} engines {{to satisfy their}} needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was {{a major contributor to}} the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> France would never allow them independence.|$|E
5|$|Anning's discoveries became key {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of the bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E

60|$|A {{few more}} remarks {{were made by}} several of those who stood on the quarter-deck, {{suggesting}} a treatment of the Esquimaux which was not of the gentlest nature, for <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> indignant <b>that</b> their hospitality had been abused.|$|R
5|$|In 1994 a {{committee}} of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hahnium (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn, after an older suggestion of ottohahnium (Oh) {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name, so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (meitnerium) would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This was because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society, IUPAC relented and the name hassium (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> some of the characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but {{that many of the}} other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E

5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was {{the main}} focus of the Insomniac Team during development. The team of around 115 people were aiming to create a new Ratchet and Clank game that would differ {{significantly}} from its predecessors and almost end up being two games in one. Insomniac believed that one of the key processes in the development process was the rigorous testing. Working closely with Sony and listening to fans of the Ratchet and Clank series, they gathered feedback and made improvements to the game. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they had created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with the inclusion of elements of platform, action and side-scrolling gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given to green and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team. They were historically awarded to all South African teams and individuals representing the country in international competition following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned by the various control boards since <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement. An exception was made {{in the case of the}} national rugby union team where they have retained the practice of awarding colours.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality buy shares for NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the railway would have no impact on them, and that the municipality should only buy shares for NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and private investors, who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E

50|$|The New York Times {{described}} {{the book as}} somewhat cliched but praised the honest approach to racial and class warfare. <b>They</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the seriousness of the}} novel's themes made a jarring contrast with the flippancy of the detective characters.|$|R
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom Hourglass. In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link to be controlled. However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too disconnected from the game's action, thereby prompting them to switch the two screens. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|The work of Thirty Seconds to Mars {{generated}} {{the interest of}} record producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked on several groundbreaking projects, including The Wall by Pink Floyd, Love It to Death by Alice Cooper, and Destroyer by Kiss. Thirty Seconds to Mars contacted Ezrin because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he {{had the ability to}} help them achieve their own vision and create a distinct sound; moreover, the band's members grew up listing to his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper. Brian Virtue, who had previously worked with Jane's Addiction, joined the band and Ezrin in producing the record.|$|E
