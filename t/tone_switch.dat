5000|$|This unique fuzz tone is {{an octave}} fuzz using two {{germanium}} diodes {{to produce the}} square wave clipping. The controls are 'Balance' (volume), 'Expander' (fuzz amount), a two position 'tone' switch, and an on/off footswitch on top. There are two unique features of this device that set it apart from other distortion and fuzz pedals. The first is that the full-wave rectification of the circuit produces an upper octave {{as well as a}} slight lower octave. This also gives the sound a lot of compression and gives a mild ring modulator effect. The second unique feature is a <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> that engages a 1kHz filter that [...] "scoops" [...] the mids, giving a very fat, almost bassy tone, unique to this circuit.|$|E

Sometimes it was packaged with a wah pedal, or with the <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> being a footswitch, or both. This circuit is also very similar to the famous Fender Blender and Roland Bee Baa. More recent applications of this circuit type can be found in CBC Pedal's SuperFuzz, Guyatone's TZ-2 Fuzz, MJM China Fuzz, Black Candy Superfuzz Deluxe, Prescription Electronics' OUTBOX, BOSS's FZ-2 HYPER Fuzz, and others, although most tend to agree the newer versions do not sound quite the same.|$|E
50|$|The Pro-Line {{series of}} guitars first {{appeared}} {{on the market in}} 1985 with the PR1440, PR1550, and PR1660 models. Both the PR1440 and PR1550 featured The PR1440 was available in red while the PR1550 was available in pure white finish. The PR1660 is now a collector's item for many and was also available in pure white finish. All of these models had black hardware, pickups, and knobs. The PR1440 and 1550 featured two Ibanez S7FT single coil pickups and one Ibanez humbucking double coil pickup by the bridge, a volume and tone/push knob and 3 separate switches in place of a 3-way pickup selector(tone/push knob split the humbucker). The PR1660 on the other hand had two Ibanez V-5 pickups and were the first guitars to use these pickup. They also had one volume switch and one <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> and a 3-way pickup selector as opposed to the separate switches used on the 1440 and 1550 models.

30|$|Based on this concept, Mixdorff and Jokisch [15] {{developed}} {{a model of}} German prosody anchoring prosodic features such as F 0, duration, and intensity to the syllable as a basic unit of speech rhythm. In order to quantify the interval and timing of the <b>tone</b> <b>switches</b> {{with respect to the}} syllabic grid, the framework adopts the Fujisaki model for parameterizing F 0 contours [1]. In a perception study [16] employing synthetic stimuli of identical wording but varying F 0 contours created with the Fujisaki model, it was shown that information intonemes are characterized by an accent command ending before or early in the accented syllable, creating a falling contour. N↑ intonemes were connected with rising <b>tone</b> <b>switches</b> to the mid-range of the subject connected with an accent command beginning early in the accented syllable and plateau-like continuation up to the phrase boundary, whereas C↑ intonemes required F 0 transitions to span a total interval of more than 10 semitones and generally starting later in the accented syllable, although the F 0 interval was a more important factor than the precise alignment.|$|R

5000|$|The single pickup guitar {{was first}} {{manufactured}} in April 1950, and made its commercial debut as the Esquire in RTEC's Spring catalogue of that year. While the guitar pictured {{in the catalogue}} was painted black and had a white scratch plate, most of the Esquires produced {{at the time were}} painted semi-transparent [...] "butterscotch" [...] blonde and had a black scratch plate. Unlike the pinewood prototype, the bodies (thinner than the Broadcaster's at 1.5", instead of 1.75") were made of solid ash. The dual pickup version was first manufactured in June of that year. Neither version had a truss rod at that time, though in November, the dual pickup version acquired one and was renamed the Broadcaster. Following objections from Gretsch who produced the [...] "Broadkaster" [...] drum kit, this name was dropped, and some guitars were shipped with only the [...] "Fender" [...] logo decal and no model name (commonly referred to these days as the [...] "Nocaster") until the name Telecaster was adopted. The guitar was designed as an electronic instrument with no acoustic manipulation of the tone. Rather the guitar's pickup was designed and placed to transmit the richest signal for later manipulation by the <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> and other electronics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasoning}} for {{the heavy}} use of [...] "Junior" [...] Gibson guitars is mainly due to three key factors, one being the vintage [...] "dogear" [...] P-90 pickup. The P-90 forms an interesting combination of single coil [...] "twang" [...] and humbucker [...] "beef", producing {{a sound that}} cannot easily be categorized. The mid-frequencies are usually very, very strong and bass is underemphasized. When played with modest gain and high volume, the pickup distorts itself due to {{the distance between the}} strings (they are surface mounted) as well as the pickup's overall output. In a sense, the P90 is a super-beefed up single coil. Another key factor is the wrap-around bridge. While they are not original (they replaced the original bridges with new wrap-arounds that had two adjustable saddles), the bridges create a great deal of tone characteristic as well as greater sustain. The key element to these guitars are their designs. Both include heavy fret access (The SG and Double Cut are almost identical in that nearly every fret can be accessed, unlike Gibson's traditional Single Cut Les Paul), light bodies, a slab of mahogany (Gibson's vintage guitars used much more prestigious pieces of wood), and, most importantly, they have little distractions in the way of playing so Dan and Steve can slam away at notes without flicking a <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> out of socket or injuring themselves on a sharp bridge saddle.|$|E
30|$|We {{will discuss}} {{some of the}} basics of the {{framework}} adopted in this study. In the works of Isačenko and Schädlich [12] and Stock and Zacharias [13], a given F 0 contour is mainly described as a sequence of communicatively motivated tone switches, major transitions of the F 0 contour aligned with accented syllables. Tone switches {{can be thought of}} as the phonetic realization of phonologically distinct intonational elements, the so-called intonemes. In the original formulation by Stock, depending on their communicative function, three classes of intonemes are distinguished, namely the N↑ intoneme (‘non-terminal intoneme,’ signaling incompleteness and continuation, rising <b>tone</b> <b>switch),</b> I↓ intoneme (‘information intoneme’ at declarative-final accents, falling <b>tone</b> <b>switch,</b> conveying information), and the C↑ intoneme (‘contact intoneme’ associated, for instance, with question-final accents, rising <b>tone</b> <b>switch,</b> establishing contact). Hence, intonemes in the original sense mainly distinguish sentence modality, although there exists a variant of the I↓ intoneme, I(E)↓ which denotes emphatic accentuation and occurs in contrastive, narrowly focused environments. Intonemes for reading style speech are predictable by applying a set of phonological rules to a string of text as to word accentability and accent group formation. Other F 0 transitions - termed ‘pitch interrupters’ by Isačenko - will occur at phrase boundaries or in unstressed syllables where they do not have the same prominence-lending effect as tone switches (see [14]).|$|E

As the show progressed and Sam got into more serious relationships, the general <b>tone</b> <b>switched</b> to a comedic take on Sam settling into a monogamous lifestyle. Throughout the series, larger story arcs began to develop that spanned multiple episodes or seasons, interspersed with smaller themes and one-off episodes.|$|R

30|$|F 0 {{values were}} {{extracted}} at {{a step of}} 10 ms with F 0 floors and ceilings for male (50 to 300 Hz) and female participants (120 to 400 Hz) using the PRAAT default method [22]. All F 0 contours were then subjected to Fujisaki model parameter extraction [23], with an alpha of 2.0 /s, beta of 20.0 /s and variable Fb. Results were checked and if necessary corrected in the FujiParaEditor[24]. Evaluating the alignment between phrase and accent commands {{with respect to the}} underlying syllables, while taking into account the status of these syllables as either being lexically stressed or not, we associated each accent command with the closest syllable. As explained in Section 1, a rising <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> is invariably connected with the onset of an accent command and a falling <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> with an offset of an accent command. All other accent command onsets or offsets are related to pitch interrupters at unaccented syllables.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the influence of}} focal condition, sentence mode and phrase boundary location {{on the most important}} prosodic features of German, syllable duration and F 0 contour. A small corpus uttered by a single speaker was auditorily segmented and the F 0 contours modeled using a quantitative model decomposing the contour into a sequence of tone switches. The correlation of these tone switches with changes of the accent syllable durations was examined. It was found that narrow focusing of an item boosts the <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> at its word accent syllable whereas significant lengthening of this syllable was only observed in phrase-medial, but not in phrase-final position. In the latter case, instead of noticeable lenghtening of the word accent syllable, preceding items are being compressed. This indicates that the durational organisation of the phrase behaves in a different manner than the intonational one. Pre-phrase boundary syllables are lengtened for an average 60 % compared with phrase medial ones. 1...|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{frequency}} {{response of the}} amplifier excluding the tone stack is emulated with digital shelf filters corresponding to the data provided in Section 2.3. 6. A reliable estimate of the nonlinearity introduced by the transistors was not possible as a faithful transistor model was not available for the specific transistor models in the computer software used during <b>tone</b> <b>switch</b> simulations. The transistor nonlinearities [52] have been measured on a real Clavinet {{by the use of}} a tone generator and a signal analyzer. The input signal was a sine wave at 1 kHz of amplitude equal to the maximum one generated by pickups with normal polyphonic playing (400 mV) showing a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1 % with normal polyphonic playing, rising to 3.6 % for the highest peaks during fortissimo chord playing, which, however, is obtained only very rarely. Considering the 1 % THD data as the upper bound for normal playing, the nonlinear character of the amplifier has been neglected, considering that the generated harmonic content is likely to be masked by the Clavinet tones.|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a preliminary study of Finnish prosody using a quantitative model. In a small corpus of segmentally identical utterances the focus, the sentence mode {{and the place}} of the phrase boundary were systematically varied. Following the rationale of MFGI, the Mixdorff-Fujisaki Model of German intonation, the phonetic properties of the contrast-lending intonemes were examined. These properties differ strongly from those of German: Although the place of narrow focus is marked by higher accent command amplitudes, <b>tone</b> <b>switches</b> on pre-focal and post-focal accents are never completely deleted. Yes/no questions with final rises are perceived as less natural by Finnish listeners than those marked by a question particle. Non-terminal utterances are not marked by clear rises, but rather by a fall that does not reach the lower edge of the speaker'...|$|R
50|$|Scholars {{are divided}} on the {{interpretation}} of how Catullus addresses Furius and Aurelius in this poem. Some {{think that he is}} being serious and truly holds Furius and Aurelius as some of his closest friends that he will have until he dies. Others believe that Catullus has more of an ironic tone. For example, Catullus' <b>tone</b> <b>switches</b> dramatically {{in the second half of}} the poem, as he asks them to just walk across the street to Catullus after naming all these far away places to go to. This hints that Catullus' tone might be more on the ironical side. But, in general, it can be argued either way, as it seems he is serious in the first half, but this seriousness is deflated in the last 2 stanzas of the poem.|$|R

50|$|As a result, in {{many large}} venues {{much of the}} onstage sound {{reaching}} the musicians now comes from in-ear monitors, not from the instrument amplifiers. While stacks of huge speaker cabinets and amplifiers are still used in concerts (especially in heavy metal), this is often mainly for aesthetics or {{to create a more}} authentic <b>tone.</b> The <b>switch</b> to smaller instrument amplifiers makes it easier for musicians to transport their equipment to performances.

40|$|A further {{technique}} to characterise {{the dependence of}} a neuron’s spike count upon the sequence stastistics is the switching oddball paradigm of Ulanovsky et al. [1]. In this protocol, a single sequence of tones is presented, in which the deviant <b>tone</b> <b>switches</b> {{back and forth between}} f 1 and f 2 at regular intervals. By contrast, an oddball sequence consists of two sequences of tones, and a given frequency is deviant in one sequence and standard in the other. In the switching blocks experiments performed here, one thousand blocks of twenty tones are presented, and the statistics alternate between blocks: in the odd blocks, f 1 is deviant; and in the even blocks, f 2 is deviant. In every block, pdev = 0. 2; and the ratio of standards to deviants is controlled, so there are always four deviants per block, and f 1 and f 2 appear an equal number of times over the entire sequence (i. e., ten thousand times). The probability of a deviant and the block length used here have been carried over from the original switching blocks experiments [1]. However, we use the same tone duration (200 ms) and tone rate (1 Hz) used in the oddball experiments—a presentation rate slightly slower than that used in [1] (∼ 1. 36 Hz).

50|$|Auditory illusory conjunctions occur either {{when two}} sounds are {{presented}} in different positions in space, but a single sound is heard, or when two different sounds {{are presented in}} different positions in space, {{but some of them}} are heard in the wrong spatial location. In the octave illusion, the listener is presented via earphones with a 20-second sequence consisting of two alternating tones that are an octave apart, and are repeatedly presented in alternation. The tones are 250 ms in duration. The same sequence is presented to the two ears, but when the right ear receives the high tone the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most listeners hear this sequence as a single tone that repeatedly changes both in pitch and in location. It has been suggested that time limitations contribute to this auditory illusory conjunction but see other explanations in terms of separate 'what' and 'where' pathways. In the scale illusion, the listener is presented via headphones with a scale with alternating <b>tones</b> <b>switching</b> from ear to ear. The scale is presented in both ascending and descending form, such that when a tone form the ascending scale is in the right ear, a tone from the descending scale is in the left ear. This gives rise to illusory conjunctions of pitch and location, such that all the higher tones are heard in one ear and all the lower tones in the other ear. Similar illusory conjunctions give rise to the chromatic illusion, the glissando illusion, and the cambiata illusion.|$|R
40|$|Being a British colony {{for more}} than a century, Hong Kong has been {{influenced}} by the western culture in multiple aspects. One of the prominent western footprints is the ubiquitous Cantonese-English code switching and code mixing behavior which permeates all walks of life in this bilingual community. Though having seen its pervasiveness in different domains, limited studies from the sociolinguistic perspective have been conducted in the broadcasting domain, especially within the radio broadcast domain. This research gap prompts a study idea to unravel the sociolinguistic motivations behind the Cantonese-English code switching and code mixing behavior in Hong Kong radio broadcasts. Instances of code-switched and code-mixed which happened during the conversations among radio hosts were transcribed from the broadcasts of Commercial Radio Hong Kong (CRHK) between April 26 th and May 24 th 2013 for exploratory analysis. The language alternation behavior was investigated through a communicative discourse context. In essence, the reasons motivating code switching and code mixing behavior among radio hosts include ‘principle of economy’, ‘generality/ specificity’, ‘euphemism’ and ‘emotional buffer’. Code switching/ code mixing also serves as a purposeful communicative strategy in <b>tone</b> <b>switching</b> or creating comical effect to enhance the entertainment value of the programs. It also helps the speakers to portray a particular social orientation or specifically, to project a western image. By code switching/ code mixing, the hosts also take into consideration of the societal preference of codes. The ideas of ‘we-code’, ‘they-code’, and ‘social distance’ are also applicable in exploring the social meaning of code switching/ code mixing within the Hong Kong radio broadcasts. published_or_final_versionEnglish StudiesMasterMaster of Art...|$|R
