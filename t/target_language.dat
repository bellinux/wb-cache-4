25|$|Pimsleur {{language}} learning system {{is based on}} the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher Paul Pimsleur. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the <b>target</b> <b>language,</b> and occasionally to respond in the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> to lines spoken in the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.|$|E
25|$|According to Gardner and Lambert (1972) {{a learner}} is {{instrumental}} orientated if learning {{a foreign language}} has a function, e.g. for success in career terms. Thereby, the language becomes an instrument to achieve the higher purpose and the foreign language learning is concentrated on fulfilling {{the aim of the}} learner (Feuerhake 2004: 9).The integrative orientation follows the aim of acculturating with the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> and country as well as the integration into the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> community.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} on human translators {{to enhance the}} quality of the translation is not free of problems. Besides syntactic and semantic factors there are factors of style and aesthetics of the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> While many so-called professional translators could produce comprehensible text of higher quality than machine translation, the quality of the text in the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> is difficult to assess. Awkward or unfluent texts, when admitted in the system, may establish norms and frame of reference that don't serve the purpose of enhancing the overall quality of translation, and an example for translators, or aspiring translators to imitate. This, however, is arguably outside of the scope of the project.|$|E

25|$|Spontaneous second {{language}} acquisition (and {{the genesis of}} pidgins) involves the gradual relexification of the native or source language with target-language vocabulary.

40|$|Abstract. Several {{classes of}} propositional {{formulas}} {{have been used}} as <b>target</b> <b>languages</b> for knowledge compilation. Some are based primarily on c-paths (essentially, the clauses in disjunctive normal form); others are based primarily on dpaths. Such duality is not surprising in light of the duality fundamental to classical logic. There is also duality among <b>target</b> <b>languages</b> in terms of how they treat links (complementary pairs of literals) : Some are link-free; others are pairwise-linked (essentially, each pair of clauses is linked). In this paper, both types of duality are explored, first, by investigating the structure of existing forms, and secondly, by developing new forms for <b>target</b> <b>languages.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their <b>target</b> <b>language</b> prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
25|$|The direct method, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} natural method, {{is a method}} that refrains from using the learners' native language and just uses the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> It was established in Germany and France around 1900 and is best represented by the methods devised by Berlitz and de Sauzé, although neither claims originality {{and it has been}} re-invented under other names.|$|E

25|$|Infants now combine {{different}} vowels and consonants into syllable strings. At this stage, infants {{also produce}} various stress and intonation patterns. During this transitional period from babbling {{to the first}} word children also produce “protowords”, i.e., invented words that are used consistently to express specific meanings, but that are not real words in the children’s <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> Around 12–14 months of age children produce their first word.|$|E
25|$|Other {{considerations}} in writing a singing translation include repetition {{of words and}} phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line {{that may be more}} natural to the original language than to the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a contrafactum.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{approaches}} to {{statistical machine translation}} is based on joint probability distributions over some source and <b>target</b> <b>languages.</b> In this work we propose to model the joint probability distribution by stochastic regular bi-languages. Specifically we introduce the stochastic k-testable {{in the strict sense}} bi-languages to represent the joint probability distribution of source and <b>target</b> <b>languages.</b> With this basis we present a reformulation of the GIATI methodology to infer stochastic regular bi-languages for machine translation purposes. ...|$|R

25|$|Most romanizations are {{intended}} to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully {{as possible in the}} <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> The popular Hepburn romanization of Japanese {{is an example of a}} transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{phenomenon}} is relearning. Some studies show that, despite {{the end of}} learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in reading and listening comprehension. He says that it happens because a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).|$|E
25|$|Claude Piron {{writes that}} machine translation, at its best, automates the easier {{part of a}} translator's job; the harder and more {{time-consuming}} part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> require to be resolved. Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing {{necessary in order to}} provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be meaningless.|$|E

25|$|The written {{forms of}} {{language}} {{can be considered}} another modality. Sign languages do not have widely accepted written forms, so deaf individuals learn {{to read and write}} an oral language. This is known as sign–print bilingualism—a deaf individual has fluency in (at least) one sign language as their primary language and has literacy skills in the written form of (at least) one oral language, without access to other resources of the oral language that are gained through auditory stimuli. Orthographic systems employ the morphology, syntax, lexical choices, and often phonetic representation of their <b>target</b> <b>language</b> in at least superficial ways; one must learn these new features of the <b>target</b> <b>language</b> in order to read or write. In communities where there is standardized education for the deaf, such as the United States and the Netherlands, deaf individuals do gain skill sets in reading and writing in the oral language of the community. In such a state, bilingualism is achieved between a sign language and the written form of the community's oral language. In this view, all sign–print bilinguals are bimodal bilinguals, but all bimodal bilinguals may not be sign–print bilinguals.|$|E
25|$|Transliteration {{is opposed}} to transcription, which maps the sounds of one {{language}} into a writing system. Still, most systems of transliteration map {{the letters of the}} source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> If the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages, a transliteration may be very close to a transcription. In practice, there are some mixed transliteration/transcription systems that transliterate a part of the original script and transcribe the rest.|$|E
25|$|In this respect, Kalaw Lagaw Ya {{appears to}} be a classic case of shift, whereby {{speakers}} of one language, {{over a long period of}} time, retained multilingualism while taking over aspects of the <b>target</b> <b>language.</b> The Austronesian and Papuan overlay changed the originally Australian phonology and syntax profoundly. The contrast of Australian laminal nh/ny and lh/ly and apical n and l has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and s, z, t, d, o and òò have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, such that these 'foreign' sounds occur in such words.|$|E
40|$|Wikipedia is a {{very popular}} online {{multilingual}} encyclopedia that contains millions of articles covering most written languages. Wikipedia pages contain monolingual hypertext links to other pages, as well as inter-language links to the corresponding pages in other languages. These inter-language links, however, are not always complete. We present a prototype for a cross-lingual link discovery tool that discovers missing Wikipedia inter-language links to corresponding pages in other languages for ambiguous nouns. Although the framework of our approach is language-independent, we built a prototype for our application using Dutch as an input language and Spanish, Italian, English, French and German as <b>target</b> <b>languages.</b> The input for our system {{is a set of}} Dutch pages for a given ambiguous noun, and the output of the system is a set of links to the corresponding pages in our five <b>target</b> <b>languages.</b> Our link discovery application contains two submodules. In a first step all pages are retrieved that contain a translation (in our five <b>target</b> <b>languages)</b> of the ambiguous word in the page title (Greedy crawler module), whereas in a second step all corresponding pages are linked between the focus language (being Dutch in our case) and the five <b>target</b> <b>languages</b> (Cross-lingual web page linker module). We consider this second step as a disambiguation task and apply a cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation framework to determine whether two pages refer to the same content or not...|$|R
