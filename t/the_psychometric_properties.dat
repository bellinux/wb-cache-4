2500|$|Lexical {{measures}} use individual adjectives {{that reflect}} extravert and introvert traits, such as outgoing, talkative, reserved and quiet. Words representing introversion are reverse coded to create composite measures of extraversion/introversion {{running on a}} continuum. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure {{as part of his}} 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. However, <b>the</b> <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> of Saucier's original mini-markers have been found suboptimal with samples outside of North America. As a result, a systematically revised measure was developed to have superior psychometric properties, the International English Mini-Markers. The International English Mini-Markers has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing extraversion/introversion and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the Extraversion measure for native English-speakers is reported as [...]92, that for non-native English-speakers is [...]85.|$|E

40|$|Background: Quality {{improvement}} {{initiatives have}} expanded recently within the healthcare sector. Studies {{have shown that}} less than 40 % of these initiatives are successful, indicating {{the need for an}} instrument that can measure the progress and results of quality improvement initiatives and answer questions about how quality initiatives are conducted. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop and test an instrument to measure improvement process and outcome in Swedish healthcare. Methods: A questionnaire, founded on the Minnesota Innovation Survey (MIS), was developed in several steps. Items were merged and answer alternatives were revised. Employees participating in a county council improvement program received the web-based questionnaire. Data was analysed by descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. <b>The</b> questionnaire <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> were investigated and an exploratory factor analysis was conducted. Results: The Swedish Improvement Measurement Questionnaire consists of 27 items. The Improvement Effectiveness Outcome dimension consists of three items and has a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0. 67. The Internal Improvement Processes dimension consists of eight sub-dimensions with a total of 24 items. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the complete dimension was 0. 72. Three significant item correlations were found. A large involvement in the improvement initiative was shown and the majority of the respondents were satisfied with their work. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>psychometric</b> <b>property</b> tests suggest initial support for the questionnaire to study and evaluate quality improvement initiatives in Swedish healthcare settings.

40|$|Objective: Preparing {{patients}} for medical interventions improves patient outcomes {{and is an}} ethical and legal imperative. This review examines <b>the</b> characteristics and <b>psychometric</b> <b>properties</b> of published instruments which assess patients' preparation for medical interventions. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched from the date of their inception to November 2015. Data-based publications describing the development or validation of a self-report instrument designed to assess the quality of adult patients' perceived preparation for a medical intervention were included. Results: Nine publications described the development or validation of seven instruments which met inclusion criteria. <b>The</b> <b>psychometric</b> qualities of <b>the</b> instruments varied.
