He {{eventually}} chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough {{that it is impossible to}} read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team spent a lot of <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

[...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Assessment of patients referred for therapy. SETTING [...] District general hospital. PATIENTS [...] Six patients aged 35 to 55 (mean 43) years with a mean duration of symptoms of 12 years who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) criteria for hypochondriasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of visits to their doctors, <b>time</b> spent <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> illness, and scores on the hospital anxiety and depression scales. RESULTS [...] The mean number of visits to a doctor fell significantly after treatment (3 before treatment v 0. 8 after treatment; p = 0. 03) as did the <b>time</b> spent <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> illness (57. 3 v 40. 6; p = 0. 14). The depression and anxiety scores also fell, although the differences were not significant (depression: 9. 5 before v 8. 5 after; anxiety: 13 before v 12 after).
