5|$|On 4 February 1944 Hauptmann Hermann Segatz {{replaced}} Hauptmann Walter Hoeckner {{as commander}} of II./JG 1. Although Major Bär had led I./JG 77, his out spoken {{criticism of the}} Luftwaffe leadership led Reichsmarschall Göring to demote him to Staffelkapitän leading an operation training group. He was transferred on 21 January 1944 to 6./JG 1 as an ordinary pilot. Walter Oesau welcomed him with assurances to High Command <b>that</b> <b>Bär</b> would not have command responsibilities. Oesau however managed to utilize Bär's skills as formation leader {{after the death of}} Segatz on 8 March 1944, and Bär was appointed as acting commander of II./ JG 1.|$|E
5|$|Why the Swedish fleet {{deviated}} {{from the original}} plan of engaging the allied force in home waters north of Öland has never been satisfactorily explained. According to Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on Kronan, Creutz made a turn because Uggla had signaled {{that he was going}} about. Rosenberg also believed <b>that</b> <b>Bär</b> on Nyckeln, admiral of the first squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla considered it necessary to follow this unplanned maneuver to keep the fleet together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both survived Svärdet, claimed that only Creutz as fleet commander could have made such a decision and that Uggla was only following Kronans lead. Witnesses who testified before the commission claimed that conflict between the officers was the reason that necessary precautions were not taken before Kronan came about. Rosenberg testified that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid Björnram and Major Klas Ankarfjäll had openly disagreed on how much sail should be set and how close to land the ship should sail. According to Gyllenspak, senior fleet pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his concerns against turning in the rough weather, but no one had heeded his advice.|$|E

25|$|Believers in the {{authenticity}} of the Zohar countered that the lack of references to the work in Jewish literature were because bar Yohai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the Zohar. They found it unsurprising <b>that</b> <b>bar</b> Yochai should have foretold future happenings or made references to historical events of the post-Talmudic period.|$|E
25|$|According to two {{different}} Christian traditions, Simon bar Kokhba, {{the leader of}} the second Jewish revolt against Rome (132-136 AD) who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts <b>that</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join his revolt against the Romans. The latter is likely true, and Christians' refusal {{to take part in the}} revolt against the Roman Empire was a key event in the schism of Early Christianity and Judaism.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 students, he was left with only five students, among them Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The latter {{went on to become}} the {{greatest}} teacher of Torah in his generation, and is purported to have authored the Zohar, a landmark text of Jewish mysticism. The Zohar calls the day of Bar Yochai's death a hillula. Rabbi Chaim Vital, the main disciple of Rabbi Isaac Luria and author of , was the first to name Lag BaOmer as the date of Bar Yochai's hillula. According to the Zohar (III, 287b–296b), on the day of Bar Yochai's death, he revealed the deepest secrets of the Kabbalah. Lag BaOmer therefore became a day of celebration of the great light (i.e., wisdom) <b>that</b> <b>Bar</b> Yochai brought into the world.|$|E

At the same time Air General (General der Flieger) Karl Koller had ordered JV 44 to relocate to Prague and continue fighting. Bär, as a Galland loyalist, attempted to ignore the order. Bär was further pressured to relocate JV 44 when Major General (Generalmajor) Dietrich Peltz, commander of IX. Fliegerkorps, and Colonel Hajo Herrmann, commander of 9. Flieger-Division (J), unexpectedly emerged at the control room in Maxglan on 2 May 1945. A heated and violent dispute erupted between Bär, Peltz and Herrmann, witnessed by Walter Krupinski.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker {{said the}} pairing of Poehler and Posey led to great comedic scenes, {{but that the}} [...] "heart of the episode" [...] was Leslie's celebration of Ron's birthday. Tucker praised the show's optimistic tone, with {{characters}} who genuinely respect and love each other, even while many other comedies remained cynical. Hillary Busis, also of Entertainment Weekly, called Posey's performance [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] and called Leslie's construction of the baseball diamond [...] "a sweet coda to a great, funny episode". Postmedia News writer Alex Strachan praised the episode {{not only for its}} likable and easily relatable characters, but for its willingness to address social issues like the divide between classes in Pawnee and Eagleton. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Eagleton" [...] seemed less story-driven and more over-the-top than usual, but that it works for the series because those episodes are funny and only happen periodically. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic complimented Posey's performance, but especially praised Leslie's birthday surprise for Ron, and claimed {{it was the first time}} since the NBC series Friends that he responded to a television comedy so emotionally. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode handled the rivalry between Pawnee and Eagleton nearly as well as some of the classic Cheers episodes about <b>that</b> <b>bar</b> and its rival, the Old Towne Tavern. He also called Offerman [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] in what Porter described as an excellent B-story.|$|E

The poor start only got worse at the [...] Button finished third, but after the race scrutineers found his car had a second fuel tank kept inside the main tank; once both were drained, his car was 5.4kg underweight. Although the race stewards took no action, the FIA appealed against the decision and the case was examined by the FIA International Court of Appeal.

2500|$|The 13th-century author Bar Hebraeus gave {{a figure}} of 6,944,000 Jews in the Roman world Salo Wittmayer Baron {{considered}} the figure convincing. The figure of seven million within and one million outside the Roman world in the mid-first century became widely accepted, including by Louis Feldman. However, contemporary scholars now accept <b>that</b> <b>Bar</b> Hebraeus based his figure on a census of total Roman citizens.
