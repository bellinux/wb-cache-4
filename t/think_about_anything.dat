25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> but {{finishing}} it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Bolt {{was born}} on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, {{a small town in}} Jamaica, the son of Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt. He has a brother named Sadiki and a sister named Sherine. His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and {{football}} in the street with his brother, later saying, [...] "When I was young, I didn't really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> other than sports." [...] As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he first began to show his sprinting potential, running in the annual national primary-schools' meeting for his parish. By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance.|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentencesâ€”a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

Don't {{you think he is}} very good about it, mamma?" ...|$|R
50|$|The crowd {{began to}} hiss, and, as Uncle didn't want a row, {{he decided to}} {{withdraw}} and take action later. The moment he and his party {{got out of the}} crowd, they were forgotten. The Professor had started frying a conger eel in an enormous pan, {{and this is one of}} star turns; and nobody <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else when he does it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else much. A woman can't {{do a great}} deal, even nowadays, but she {{can have}} a {{conscience}} and feel that she owes something {{to the future of}} the race. She can feel that it is her duty to bring fine children into the world. As Aunt Lora says, she can carry the torch and not falter." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{got your}} letter at Memphis as I went down. That {{is the best}} place to write me at. The post office here is always out of my route, somehow or other. Remember the direction: [...] "S.L.C., Steamer Pennsylvania Care Duval & Algeo, Wharfboat, Memphis." [...] I cannot {{correspond}} with a paper, because when one is learning the river, he is not allowed to do or <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Good-bye, Miss Dombey!' stammers Mr Toots. 'I {{hope you}} won't <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. It's--it's of no {{consequence}}, thank you. It's {{not of the}} least consequence in the world.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{was quite}} sure that Dora's {{deductions}} were correct, for when Miriam happened to drop asleep in {{a chair in the}} evening, it was her habit, when aroused, {{to get up and go}} to bed, too sleepy to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else; but he did not think it was funny now. He was mortified that Miss Bannister should have been treated with such apparent disrespect, and he began to apologize for his sister.|$|E
60|$|So, {{without a}} word to anybody, {{she ran to the}} upright stake and began to climb it. This was a very unlady-like proceeding, perhaps, but Jenny did not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> of that kind. She was the oldest and the largest of them all, and {{there was no time to}} explain matters to the boys. Up she went, as {{actively}} as any boy, and scrambling to the crotch of the stake, she seated herself upon the pole.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{there was}} no doubt of it--he was quite alone; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had {{purposely}} dropped on the ledge of the window. For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> at all, but after a while he shook himself awake, and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow, if it were only to revenge himself.|$|E

60|$|As for Fred Jenkins, he was {{too much}} taken up with Elise Morel to <b>think</b> much <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> but even he at last grew anxious, and when the wedding morning finally dawned, and no Dan made his appearance, {{something}} like consternation filled the hearts of all {{within the walls of}} Ben Nevis Hall and Prairie Cottage. Elspie appeared to feel less than the others, but the truth was that she only controlled herself better.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{begin on}} that, for pity's sake, or you'll get crying again,' broke out Wilmet, in her natural voice.

6000|$|... "Oh, I can't stand these people! They don't know any-thing. They talk every rag {{of gossip}} into shreds. Taters, fish, hops; hops, fish, and taters. They've saved and pinched and toiled till their souls are pinched and ground away. You're right. They are caricatures. They don't read or <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> in which I'm interested. This life is nerve-destroying. Talk {{about the health}} of the village life! it destroys body and soul. It debilitates me. It will warp us both down to the level of these people." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was that}} it went against us. Faith's marriage, her identity, and Hester's, were proved beyond all doubt, and little Alured was served Earl of Trevorsham. Poor child, how ill he was just then! It was {{declared}} water on the brain! I could hardly <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else; but they all said it seemed like a mockery, and that he would not bear the title a week. And then Lady Hester would have been, not Countess of Trevorsham, but Viscountess Torwood, and at any rate she halved the personal property: all that had been meant for us.|$|E
60|$|There {{are only}} a few makes of car in which you can <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> except the actual driving without {{stalling}} the engines, and Mr. Bennett's Twin-Six Complex was not one of them. It stopped {{as if it had been}} waiting for the signal.... The noise of the engine died away. The wheels ceased to revolve. The car did everything except lie down. It was a particularly pig-headed car and right from the start it had been unable to see the sense in this midnight expedition. It seemed now to have the idea that if it just lay low and did nothing, presently it would be taken back to its cosy garage.|$|E
5000|$|Ennis Hofftard (Will Arnett) - A cyclist {{who teaches}} English and chases women. His catchphrase is [...] "Catchphrases are for losers". He is inept at {{thinking}} his plans through, usually causing even more trouble, and he seldom <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> unless {{it has something}} to do with a woman or the promise of avoiding work. He is shown to be very talented when it comes to getting a woman, even being a dating teacher before becoming an English teacher. He has also exhibited on several occasions the internal thought processes of a house cat which he refers to as his [...] "comfort kitty" [...] (a live action cat with a very foul tongue) because he is cowardly. He was influenced by a feeling of failure to live up to his military dad but he later learns that his father was also a cowardly figure who has a comfort kitty of his own.|$|R
60|$|RICARDOS. For my daughter's {{settlement}} {{one thousand}} pounds. I understand {{he did not}} wish to give a cheque because of his marriage. So I did not <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it being in notes, you see.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not <b>think</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> women," [...] Frank said. [...] "We {{seemed to}} be {{fighting}} a body of demons with their wild screams and yells. Indeed, I could scarce distinguish {{the men from the}} women." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young woman}} next to me had an {{umbrella}} in her hand. I made a snatch at this and dropped off that gate like a shot. I didn't stop to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> except that beautiful picture was {{on the point of}} being swallowed up, and with a screech I dashed at those hogs like a steam engine. When they saw me coming with my screech and the umbrella they didn't stop a second, but with three great wiggles and three scared grunts they bolted {{as fast as they could}} go. I picked up the picture of the bridge, together with the portfolio, and took them to the young woman who owned them. As the hogs had gone, all three of the women was now getting down from the gate.|$|E
60|$|It {{was decided}} {{that they were to}} go to New York on a Thursday,--on Thursday week if possible, but as to that he was to let her know in a day or two. Didon was to pack up the clothes and get them sent out of the house. Didon was to have Â£50 before she went on board; and as one of the men must know about it, and must assist in having the trunks smuggled out of the house, he was to have Â£10. All had been settled beforehand, so that Sir Felix really had no need to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> 'And now,' said Marie, 'there's Didon. Nobody's looking and she can open that gate for you. When we're gone, do you creep out. The gate can be left, you know. Then we'll get out on the other side.' Marie Melmotte was {{certainly}} a clever girl.|$|E
6000|$|Gradually, as {{the night}} wore on I began to doze. A numb {{drowsiness}} stole slowly over me. I almost slept, I fancy; at any rate, I {{closed my eyes and}} ceased to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> in particular. For half an hour I was practically unconscious. Then on a sudden, as I lay there dozing, a slight noise attracted my attention. I opened my eyes and stared out silently. The door of my bedroom was pushed gently open. A hand held it gingerly ajar for a while. A brown head was thrust in at the slit, and then another. [...] "Softly!" [...] a voice murmured low in Hawaiian. I lay still, and never moved a thread or muscle of my face, but gazing across dimly through my closed eyelids I could see that one of the men was Kalaua; the other, I imagined, was a perfect stranger. My heart beat fast. Strange thoughts thronged me. [...] "Surely," [...] I said to myself, [...] "this must be Maloka." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Without {{the people}} who buy my music and support the gigs and concerts I would never have got this far. Being an {{independent}} artist, making {{the kind of music}} I do, and competing with the more commercial and larger labels can be fiercely overwhelming at times! But then I'll get an incredible email from someone who's connected with the music or have the most wonderful feedback after a gig and I couldn't ever <b>think</b> <b>about</b> doing <b>anything</b> else!!"

Go forth erect into the cheerful morning air, andâ€”and stop there. Live hard and temperately, be respectful, exercise your self-denial, bring up your family on next to nothing, pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes, be punctual in your dealings (I set you a good example; you will find Mr. Fish, my confidential secretary, with a cash-box before him at all times); and you may trust to me to be your Friend and Father.â€™ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish I {{could be}} very ill, and die before then,' she thought. 'When people get very ill, they don't mind about things. Poor Patty Richards looked so happy {{when she was in}} a decline. She didn't seem to care any more about her lover that she was engaged to be married to, and she liked the smell of the flowers so, that I used to take her. O, if I could but like anything--if I could but <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else! If these dreadful {{feelings}} would go away, I wouldn't mind about not being happy. I wouldn't want anything--and I could do what would please Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel. But when that rage and anger comes into me, I don't know what to do. I don't feel the ground under me; I only feel my head and heart beating, and it seems as if I must do something dreadful. O! I wonder if any one ever felt like me before. I must be very wicked. But God will have pity on me; He knows all I have to bear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 64. Second reply.--It {{is often}} said, with some {{appearance}} of plausibility, that I dwell {{in all my}} writings on little things and contemptible details; and not on essential and large things. Now, in the first place, as soon as our architects become capable of doing and managing little and contemptible things, it will be {{time to talk about}} larger ones; at present I do not see that they can design so much as a niche or a bracket, and therefore they need not as yet <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> larger. For although, as both just now, and always, I have said, there is as much science of arrangement needed in the designing {{of a small group of}} parts as of a large one, yet assuredly designing the larger one is not the easier work of the two. For the eye and mind can embrace the smaller object more completely, and if the powers of conception are feeble, they get embarrassed by the inferior members which fall within the divisions of the larger design.[21] So that, of course, the best way is to begin with the smaller features; for most assuredly, those who cannot design small things cannot design large ones; and yet, on the other hand, whoever can design small things perfectly, can design whatever he chooses. The man who, without copying, and by his own true and original power, can arrange a cluster of rose-leaves nobly, can design anything. He may fail from want of taste or feeling, but not from want of power.|$|E
