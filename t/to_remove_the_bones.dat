50|$|In certain cases, {{irreducible}} {{compression of}} the brainstem occurs from in front (anteriorly or ventral) {{resulting in a}} smaller posterior fossa and associated Chiari malformation. In these cases, an anterior decompression is required. The most commonly used approach is to operate through <b>the</b> mouth (transoral) <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> compressing <b>the</b> brainstem, typically the odontoid. This results in decompressing the brainstem and therefore gives more room for the cerebellum, thus decompressing the Chiari malformation. Arnold Menzes, MD, is the neurosurgeon who pioneered this approach in the 1970s at the University of Iowa. Between 1984 and 2008 (the MR imaging era), 298 patients with irreducible ventral compression of the brainstem and Chiari type 1 malformation underwent a transoral approach for ventral cervicomedullary decompression at the University of Iowa. The results have been excellent resulting in improved brainstem function and resolution of the Chiari malformation {{in the majority of}} patients.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{lacrimal}} sac is the structure {{most vulnerable to}} injury when performing osteotomies for rhinoplasty. When performed in a low lateral position or along the frontal process of the frontal-maxillary suture, osteotomies {{have the potential to}} tear the medial canthal ligament and injure the underlying {{lacrimal sac}} resulting in dacryocystitis. We report a case of dacryocystitis in a 19 year old male who presented with recurrent episodes of pain, tearing, and discharge from his left eye following primary rhinoplasty. He was found to have obstruction of the lacrimal system secondary to a low lateral osteotomy with an impinging bone fragment on imaging. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy was performed using a Sonopet® ultrasonic bone aspirator under image guidance <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> fragments posing risk to further injury to the lacrimal sac and orbit. Patency of the nasolacrimal duct was achieved and the patient remained symptom free at 6 month follow up. We describe the first case of recurrent dacryocystitis following rhinoplasty requiring treatment by an endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Endoscopic DCR with the use of <b>the</b> ultrasonic <b>bone</b> aspirator provides several advantages over open DCR, including the lack of an external incision and decreased risk of injury to the adjacent orbital soft tissue anatomy including the lacrimal system...|$|R

After seeking medical attention, Turley was diagnosed with bone chips in his elbow. He underwent surgery in <b>the</b> offseason <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> chips, and returned to the Yankees confident his performance would improve in 1962.

On June 25, Turley started a game that lasted 22 innings, and a record seven hours, but was removed after recording only one out. During the 1962 season, American League players elected Turley as their player representative, following Woodling's trade to the National League.

5000|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} is an orthopaedic {{surgical procedure}} {{which aims to}} correct a varus deformation with compartmental osteoarthritis. It is usually reserved for younger patients who are generally more active (1). Angular deformities were first described by Mikulicz-Radecki in 1880. He observed that the axis of the lower extremity passes through the three joints of the hip, knee and ankle in normal individuals and the knee center deviates from this line in angular deformities of the knee. In this case, the medial compartment will bear the weight in genuvarum and lateral compartment will bear weight in genuvalgum, and osteoarthritis will develop in the mentioned compartment. High tibial osteotomy was described first by Jackson in 1958 and has nowadays become a well-established surgery. Coventry, who was a pioneer in this field, has published many reports {{on the results of}} closed wedge HTO (2). Orthopedic dual sliding compression plate (ODSCP) was designed and introduced for open wedge high tibial osteotomies. The advantages over the conventional techniques are reducing the chance of accidental intra-articular extension of the osteotomy, eliminating the potential risk of unwanted translation or rotation of <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> ability to readjust the alignment after surgery without <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> screws (3). Since the population in most countries is becoming aged, the genuvarum and consequently the resulting osteoarthritis will increase, and if the patient fulfills the criteria, high tibial osteotomy is advisable (4).|$|R
