5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> take-off, but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing flameout of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E

25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 shaft horsepower with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a Kort nozzle on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a bow thruster which provides athwartship <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E
25|$|As an experiment, {{the basic}} single-seat Su-6 design was {{converted}} into a mixed-power high-altitude interceptor named Su-7 (the name was reused in 1950s for a supersonic fighter-bomber). The armor was removed and the fuselage was of all-metal construction. Power came from a Shvetsov ASh-82FN piston engine with two TK-3 turbochargers in the nose and a Glushko RD-1-KhZ rocket engine in the tail. The piston engine produced 1,380kW (1,850hp), while the rocket engine utilized kerosene and nitric acid for fuel and generated 2.9kN (600lbf) of <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> up to 4 minutes. Armament consisted of three 20mm ShVAK cannon with 370 rounds of ammunition. The sole Su-7 was completed in 1944. Test flights demonstrated {{a top speed of}} 510km/h (275kn, 315mph) at 12,000m (39,370ft) without the rocket motor, and 705km/h (380kn, 440mph) with the rocket. In 1945, the rocket motor exploded during flight testing, killing the pilot and destroying the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|E

500|$|The SEPECAT Jaguar {{is powered}} by the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour {{turbofan}} engine, which was developed in parallel and primarily for the Jaguar.

500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{demarcation}} {{between the}} thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal telson, make up the [...] "tail fan". It is the sudden flexion of this tail fan that provides the <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the tail fan is also used in steering. [...] In Leptostraca, the appendages on the telson instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions).|$|E
500|$|Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet's takeoff {{performance}} left {{much to be}} desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, {{the aircraft}} routinely required 10,000ft (3,000m) of runway for takeoff even {{with the help of}} RATO bottles (two or four of these were carried, each producing 1,000lbf (4.4kN) of <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> 14 seconds). All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. Early F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 160mph (140kn, 260km/h) with the control stick held all the way back. Landings were made at a similar speed, for comparison the North American P-51 Mustang landed at approximately 120mph (100kn, 190km/h). Despite the [...] "hot" [...] landing speeds, the Thunderjet was easy to fly on instruments and crosswinds did not present much of a problem.|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue that}} has been {{difficult}} to understand is how they took off. Earlier suggestions were that pterosaurs were largely cold-blooded gliding animals, deriving warmth from the environment like modern lizards, rather than burning calories. In this case, it was unclear how the larger ones of enormous size, with an inefficient cold-blooded metabolism, could manage a bird-like takeoff strategy, using only the hind limbs to generate <b>thrust</b> <b>for</b> getting airborne. Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs would enable them to take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to [...] and travel thousands of kilometres.|$|E
