40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{created the}} National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP) to manage DOE’s {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF). One of the NSNFP’s tasks is to prepare spent nuclear fuel for storage, transportation, and {{disposal}} at the national repository. As part of this effort, the NSNFP developed a standardized canister for interim storage and transportation of SNF. These canisters will be built and sealed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III, Division 3 requirements. Packaging SNF usually is a three-step process: canister loading, closure welding, and closure weld verification.

40|$|Abstract. Socket welds are {{commonly}} used to assemble small-bore carbon steel process piping systems {{because they can be}} fabricated fairly quickly and are somewhat tolerant of field fit-up issues. In the most simplistic terms, these welds are made by inserting the pipe into a socket and then <b>seal</b> <b>welding</b> using gas tungsten arc welding around the gap between the outside pipe wall {{and the end of the}} fitting. This leaves a notch in the root of the <b>seal</b> <b>weld</b> that is open to the process fluid. This notch can act both as a stress riser and a crevice capable of concentrating chemical species. In many process applications, these socket weld notches do not cause any in-service problems. However, in the case of sour service, these notches can become problematic because of the potential for sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC). For SSCC to occur, the right combination of stress, environment, and material susceptibility must be present. Therefore, for socket welds to be used in sour service without the risk of failure, these parameters need to be controlled by proper design and fabrication of the welded joint. Since a crevice is created as a natural by-product of a socket weld geometry, where the SSCC environment will be present, the parameter most readily controlled to minimize susceptibility to SSCC is the microstructure and residual stress of the weld filler metal. As will be shown, this resistance to SSCC can b...|$|R

The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|R
40|$|Selected {{components}} from a staianless steel nonregenerative {{heat exchanger}} {{removed from the}} U. S. S. Nautilus (SSN 571) have been examined for evidence of stress-corrosion cracking. The examination was conducted on three baffle plates, all primary-face <b>seal</b> <b>welds,</b> and the tubes and the surrounding tube sheets of 7 {{out of a total}} of 35 tubes. Maximum operating temperature of the heat exchanger was 260 ction prod- F for the inlet primary water and 164 ction prod- F for the exit secondary water. Chloride content of the secondary water averaged 5 ppm, with a maximum of 15 ppm. Only one suspected stress-corrosion crack was found in the components normally in contact with the secondary water. The crack, 2. 5 mils in depth, was located on a fully exposed tube. At the 95 per cent confidence level this represented a probability of finding cracking on fully exposed surfaces in 0 to 60 per cent of the rest of the tubes in the heat exchanger. Severe stress-corrosion cracking was found in tubes in the tube-sheet drain area at the juncture with the inner tube sheet at the inlet end, where secondary water seeped past the expanded tubes. Cracks were detected in five of seven tubes for a statistical probability of 25 to 96 per cent at the 95 per cent confidence level. Maximum depth of cracks was 28 mils or 80 per cent penetration of the 35 -mil-thick tubing wall. Stress-corrosion cracks also were found around several holes on the drain-side tube-sheet surfaces at the inlet end. Maximum depth was 12 mils, which did not seriously threaten penetration of the 9 / 16 -in. -thick tube sheet. Cracks were detected in 5 of 35 primary-face <b>seal</b> <b>welds</b> at the inlet end and in 11 of 35 at the outlet end. This behavior was attributed to hot-short cracking of the Type 347 stainless steel weldments rather than to stress corrosion. (auth...|$|R

The spent nuclear fuel will be encapsulated in copper canisters consisting of a graphite cast iron insert shielded by an outer 30 - 50 mm thick copper cylinder for corrosion and radiation protection. The cast iron insert provides the necessary strength and shielding of radiation. The critical part of the encapsulation of spent fuel is the sealing of the canister which is done by welding the copper lid to the cylindrical part of the canister. Two welding techniques have been developed in parallel at the canister lab in Oskarshamn, Electron Beam Welding (EBW) and Friction Stir Welding (FSW). Mid 2005 SKB decided that FSW is the preferred sealing technique.

40|$|Description of {{a simple}} and easily applied method of {{diffusion}} welding steel plate in air which {{does not require a}} vacuum furnace or hot press. The novel feature of the proposed welding method is that diffusion welds are made in air with deadweight loading. In addition, the use of an autogenous (self-generated) surface-cleaning principle (termed 'auto-vac cleaning') to reduce the effects of surface oxides that normally hinder diffusion welding is examined. A series of nine butt joints were diffusion welded in thick sections of AISI 1020 steel plate. Diffusion welds were attempted at three welding temperatures (1200, 1090, and 980 C) using a deadweight pressure of 34, 500 N/sq m (5 psi) and a two-hour hold time at temperature. Auto-vac cleaning operations prior to welding were also studied for the same three temperatures. Results indicate that sound welds were produced at the two higher temperatures when the joints were previously fusion <b>seal</b> <b>welded</b> completely around the periphery.

The burst test is considered simpler and more appropriate than the shear test for this application. Although the geometry, loading and boundary conditions are quite different in the two tests, structural analyses show similarity in the failure mode of the shear test in paragraph QW- 196 and the burst test on the DWPF canister nozzle Non-linear structural analyses are performed using finite element techniques to study the failure mode of the two tests. Actual test geometry and realistic stress strain data for the 304 L stainless steel and the weld material are used in the analyses. The finite element models are loaded until failure strains are reached. The failure modes in both tests are shear at the failure points. Based on these observations, it is concluded that the use of a burst test in lieu of the shear test for qualifying the canister-plug weld is acceptable. The burst test analysis for the canister-plug also yields the burst pressures which compare favorably with the actual pressure found during burst tests.
