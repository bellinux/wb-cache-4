5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has the Persians moving to the strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It {{is also possible that}} both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E

25|$|Mohenjo-daro had no {{series of}} city walls, but was {{fortified}} with guard towers {{to the west}} of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites.

25|$|Weather was {{instantly}} ruled {{out as a}} possible cause as the weather conditions were good and visibility was not limited {{at the time of}} the accident. Investigators also determined that the engines were operating {{at the time of the}} collision with terrain, that the landing gear and flaps were deployed properly, that there was no fire, neither pre-crash nor post-crash and that the crew's alcohol and drug tests returned negative results. So many uncertainties arose as to what may have contributed to or caused the accident. Because the site where the aircraft came to rest did verifiably not correspond with the official flight path – the flight ended up to the northwest of the airport whereas it was approaching it from the south – and the air traffic controller's account that the crew neither requested a deviation nor declared any other inconvenience such as an emergency, it was determined that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of navigational error by the fault of the crew.|$|E

[...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{exciting}} lines of investigation are those searching directly for new models of physics. [...] One theory {{that is the subject}} of much current research is broken supersymmetry. [...] The theory is popular because it could potentially solve a number of problems in theoretical physics and is present in almost all models of string theory. [...] Models of supersymmetry involve new, highly massive particles.

[...] The stable particles would escape the detector, leaving as a signal one or more high-energy quark jets and a large amount of [...] "missing" [...] momentum.
