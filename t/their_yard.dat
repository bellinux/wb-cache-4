5|$|The {{contract}} for the two ships was awarded to Tomlinson and Hartupee Co. on 16 May 1862. Construction was at <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Progress was slow, delayed by labor shortages and changes by the navy. The US government allocated $188,000 each {{for the construction of}} Marietta and Sandusky, but the final cost rose to $235,039 after charges for extra work.|$|E
5|$|Built by Blohm & Voss at <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> in Hamburg, Derfflingers keel {{was laid}} in January 1912. She {{was to have}} been {{launched}} on 14 June 1913, but the wooden sledges upon which the ship rested became jammed; the ship moved only 30â€“40 centimeters. A second attempt was successful on 12 July 1913. A crew composed of dockyard workers took the ship around the Skagen to Kiel. In late October, the vessel was assigned to the I Scouting Group, but damage to the ship's turbines during trials prevented her from joining the unit until 16 November.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E

25|$|When his {{organization}} needed female entertainers for the chorus line of their next show, he encouraged his 12-year-old stepdaughter to audition. While Ball was onstage, she realized performing {{was a great}} way to gain praise and recognition. Her appetite for recognition had thus been awakened at an early age. In 1927, her family suffered misfortune. Their house and furnishings were lost to settle a financial legal judgment after a neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone target shooting in <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> under the supervision of Ball's grandfather. The family subsequently moved into a small apartment in Jamestown.|$|E

25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E

2500|$|Residents (who are {{sometimes}} called Levittowners) were first expected {{to comply with}} a lengthy list of rules and regulations regarding the upkeep of their homes and use of their property. Two of these [...] "rules" [...] included a prohibition on hanging laundry out to dry on Sunday and not allowing homeowners to fence off <b>their</b> <b>yards.</b> These proved unenforceable over time, particularly when backyard pools became financially accessible to the working class and privacy concerns drove many to fence off <b>their</b> <b>yards.</b> In the years since Levitt & Sons ended construction, three- and four-story [...] "garden apartments" [...] and a number of non-Levitt owner-occupied houses have been built in Levittown.|$|R

In one case, after a life-size ceramic nativity figurine disappeared from the lawn of a community center in Wellington, Florida, sheriff's deputies tracked it to an apartment where it was found lying face-down on a carpet. An 18-year-old woman was arrested.|$|E

They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane made another landfall at Carrabelle on the Florida Panhandle. Winds {{in the region}} were estimated at , and tides ran at up to [...] above normal. In Tallahassee, the winds downed trees and power lines and scattered debris, rendering roads impassable. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "at {{the height of the}} wind several hundred Tallahasseeans were seen rushing into <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> to gather pecans which were knocked down by the swaying trees". The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region; replacement automobiles were sparse, as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army. Despite a lack of electricity due to the winds, the Tallahassee Democrat managed to publish 6,000copies of a special storm edition. Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks; however, upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary. Considerable crop and property damage was reported; total losses in the state were estimated at $675,000 USD ($ in today's terms). Seven injuries were reported, and five men drowned in the storm tide at a fishing net drying yard in Panacea, Florida. Initially, there were reports of 20 missing fishermen. 34 Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle when 10 boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided. The fishermen's supply of food was destroyed by salt water, but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries. After their rescue, they reported that five men had drowned in a small boat nearby.|$|E

2500|$|Another legend relates {{a miracle}} Hanina was once {{prevented}} from partaking of untithed food. One eve of Sabbath {{he sat down}} to his frugal meal, when suddenly the table receded from him. After thinking a while he recollected that he had borrowed some spices from a neighbor {{and that he had}} not separated the required tithe (see á¸¤aber). He thereupon adjusted the matter, and the table returned to him (Yerushalmi Demai, i. 22a). The legend also states that Hanina's donkey would not eat untithed food. Thieves had stolen the animal and confined it in <b>their</b> <b>yard,</b> furnishing it with the necessary provender; but the donkey would neither eat nor drink. As this continued for several days, the thieves concluded to free the animal, lest it starve to death and render their premises noisome. On its release it went straight home, none the worse for its long fast (Avot of Rabbi Natan, viii. 8 cf Yerushalmi Demai, i. 21d; Shabbat, 112b).|$|E

In 1959, she was chartered to Esso for use between Fawley Refinery, Hampshire, United Kingdom and Mode Wheel Locks on the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1961, she was carrying fish oil from Iceland. On 9 September 1965, Norse Commander caught fire whilst under repair in a drydock at the Albert Dock, Tanjong Pagar, Singapore. The fire was quickly extinguished and little damage was done. A reporter and cameraman from The Straits Times were refused access to the dock by the Singapore Port Authority, which claimed that the reporter [...] "might interfere with the firefighting operation, speak to the wrong people and write the wrong report". The port authority later handed out an official press release. The Straits Times commented in an editorial that the ban of its reporter was [...] "censorship of the very worst kind, bureaucracy in its stupidest mood". In 1966, Norse Commander suffered boiler defects. She arrived under tow at Singapore on 6 September. Repairs were deemed to be uneconomic, and she was sold to the Hong Huat Hardware Co, Singapore for scrapping. She arrived at <b>their</b> <b>yard</b> on 12 November 1966.|$|E

2500|$|Dennis Brown {{was born}} on 1 February 1957 at Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. His father Arthur was a scriptwriter, actor, and journalist, and {{he grew up in}} a large {{tenement}} yard between North Street and King Street in Kingston with his parents, three elder brothers and a sister, although his mother died in the 1960s. He began his singing career at the age of nine, while still at junior school, with an end-of-term concert the first time he performed in public, although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age, and as a youngster was a keen fan of American balladeers such as Brook Benton, Sam Cooke, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin. He cited Nat King Cole as one of his greatest early influences. He regularly hung around JJ's record store on Orange Street in the rocksteady era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw Brown pennies to hear him sing in <b>their</b> <b>yard.</b> Brown's first professional appearance came at the age of eleven, when he visited a local club where his brother Basil was performing a comedy routine, and where he made a guest appearance with the club's resident group, the Fabulous Falcons (a group that included Cynthia Richards, David [...] "Scotty" [...] Scott, and Noel Brown). On the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist. When the group performed at a JLP conference at the National Arena, Brown sang two songs - Desmond Dekker's [...] "Unity" [...] and Johnnie Taylor's [...] "Ain't That Loving You" [...] - and after the audience showered the stage with money, he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds. Bandleader Byron Lee performed on the same bill, and was sufficiently impressed with Brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting US artists, where he was billed as the [...] "Boy Wonder".|$|E
