5|$|The {{building}} suffered substantial damage {{during the}} 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> a corkscrew fashion.

An elevator shaft and five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured. There were no injuries but {{it was estimated that}} the repairs would cost $6million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed.|$|E

500|$|DNA can be twisted like a rope in {{a process}} called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its [...] "relaxed" [...] state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model for <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> timber. The model {{is based on}} calculating the <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> cylindrical shells and combining these shells to create timber studs. The shells will deform when the moisture content changes, owing to tangential shrinkage perpendicular to the fibre direction and longitudinal shrinkage parallel to the fibre direction. If the fibre direction is not parallel to the shell direction, this will cause <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> the shell. The <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> each shell contributes to the <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> the stud. The model {{has been used for}} a parametric study to determine theoretically the influence of parameters such as sawing pattern, stud size, spiral grain angle variation and tangential and longitudinal shrinkage. The model has also been used to predict the <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> 196 studs of Norway spruce timber. The model was able to predict 67 % of the variation <b>in</b> <b>twist</b> among these studs...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} ways to apply {{patterns}} and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called frit.

These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then [...] "picked up" [...] by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is [...] "reticello", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.|$|E
2500|$|By {{having the}} heroine {{frequently}} quote movie lines, Crusie initially implies that Sophie has difficulty distinguishing {{between reality and}} fantasy.

[...] As the novel progresses, however, {{it becomes clear that}} Sophie is one of the only characters who is fully grounded in reality. [...] The supporting characters have each embraced their own fantasies, causing them to misread their realities and make poor choices. [...] Crusie even explicitly tells the reader that the Garveys do not approve of any type of fiction, yet their characters deceive themselves with fantasies. [...] By contrast, Sophie, the character primarily associated with fiction, both in quoting it and writing it, is shown as more perceptive.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} in the next issue of Liberty, Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra raised {{additional}} concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in The Intellectual Activist with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to Albert Jay Nock in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to be noted in the text, and said, [...] "When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity." [...] Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that [...] "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor." [...] In his book The Ayn Rand Cult, journalist Jeff Walker suggested the published journals might be [...] "completely unreliable and ... may have been thoroughly <b>twisted</b> <b>in</b> the interests of the present-day cult".|$|E
