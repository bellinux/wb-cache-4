5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and}} negative ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top. They agree they must stop the war but, once <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{polluted}} air, they argue again in their urgency to get to war.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations before <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|When <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{coordinates}} {{shown on}} the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E

5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top.

This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of}} a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms.

5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
