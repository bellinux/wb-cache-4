5|$|Unable {{to contact}} Kell, Hannay flicks through <b>the</b> <b>notebook,</b> finding it {{contains}} pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map {{in the back}} and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed in the cellar. They escape and return to where they were captured to look for <b>the</b> <b>notebook,</b> which Victoria reveals she had picked from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> to Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Casting Andy {{was less}} clear-cut. Fox wanted an A-list younger actress, and felt Rachel McAdams, then coming off successes in <b>The</b> <b>Notebook</b> and Mean Girls, {{would help the}} film's {{commercial}} prospects. However, she declined several offers to play Andy, telling the studio {{she was trying to}} avoid mainstream projects for a while.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> of scientists, such {{as those}} of Michael Faraday and Charles Darwin, can reveal the {{development}} of their scientific theories. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> used by scientists for recording their experiments are called lab notebooks.|$|R
40|$|The Lloyd and Bleek Collection {{contains}} over 14000 dictionary {{pages with}} both an English word and its Bushman language translation. <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> in <b>the</b> Lloyd and Bleek Collection contain Bushman stories where {{in many cases}} English translations do not exist or are not clear. It is natural to assume that people making use of <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> {{would like to make}} use of the dictionary to translate words which appear in <b>the</b> <b>notebooks.</b> This, however, is not practical simply due to the magnitude of the dictionary. A need therefore exists to build a tool for interaction between the dictionary pages and <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> to allow for translation. A content based image retrieval (CBIR) system was built to do this and it was shown that it is possible to find the corresponding words in the dictionary by providing a single word from <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> as a search key. The system shows promising potential with well selected search keys returning relevant results...|$|R

5|$|After the film's release, several {{blogs and}} users of social media {{websites}} Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused {{the director of}} plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the original sources. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing side-by-side comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, <b>The</b> <b>Notebook</b> and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!s music director Pritam of copying the background music from the French film Amélie.|$|E
5|$|During {{the three-day}} cycle, many non-player {{characters}} follow fixed schedules that Link can track using the Bomber's Notebook. <b>The</b> <b>notebook</b> tracks the twenty characters {{in need of}} help, such as a soldier to whom Link delivers medicine, and an engaged couple whom Link reunites. Blue bars on the notebook's timeline indicate when characters are available for interaction, and icons indicate that Link has received items, such as masks, from the characters.|$|E
5|$|Gosling dated his Murder by Numbers co-star Sandra Bullock from 2002 to 2003. Gosling dated his co-star from <b>The</b> <b>Notebook,</b> fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams, from mid‑2005 to mid‑2007, {{and they}} briefly reunited in 2008. In September 2011, Gosling began dating his The Place Beyond the Pines co-star Eva Mendes. He has two daughters with Mendes, Esmeralda Amada Gosling (born September 12, 2014) and Amada Lee Gosling (born April 29, 2016).|$|E
50|$|When Brod {{published}} Kafka's diaries in 1948 {{he decided}} to omit <b>the</b> octavo <b>notebooks</b> as he considered their contents more philosophical and literary than the regular diaries Kafka kept. <b>The</b> Octavo <b>notebooks</b> were later included in a volume of fragments and uncollected writings published in 1953, along with the numbered extracts. <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> first appeared in English in Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings (Schocken Books, 1954). Some English printings removed the extracts from their original place in <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> to avoid repetition.|$|R
40|$|This node {{contains}} {{field notes}} handwritten by Felix Rau. <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> {{are not intended}} for general usage as they contain early and often preliminary transcripts, translations and annotations. <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> were archived to document the complete process of documentation and analysis and access can be granted if needed...|$|R

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. <b>The</b> <b>notebook</b> was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5|$|Blomkvist's {{daughter}} Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him {{and notes}} that the numbers from <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander {{based on the work}} she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E
5|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a wider audience in 2004 with a leading role in the commercially successful romantic drama <b>The</b> <b>Notebook.</b> His performance as a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and his performance as a socially inept loner in Lars and the Real Girl (2007) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. After a three-year acting hiatus, Gosling starred in the marital drama Blue Valentine (2010), earning him a second Golden Globe Award nomination. Gosling co-starred in three mainstream films in 2011–the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the neo-noir crime thriller Drive–and received two more Golden Globe Award nominations. His directorial debut, Lost River, was released to poor reviews in 2014. Greater success came to Gosling when he starred in two critically acclaimed films–the financial comedy-drama The Big Short (2015) and the musical La La Land (2016). For the latter, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received a second Oscar nomination.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Black <b>Notebooks</b> (Schwarze Hefte) are {{a set of}} {{notebooks}} {{written by}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), which were first published in 2014. They were edited by Peter Trawny. Originally a set of small notebooks with black covers in which Heidegger jotted observations, they have been collated into a 1000-page transcript. <b>The</b> first <b>notebook</b> is missing. <b>The</b> subsequent <b>notebooks</b> {{will be published in}} the Gesamtausgabe. So far fourteen notebooks have been published encompassing the years 1931-1941 (GA 94-96). <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> from 1942-1945 are in private possession but they have already been prepared for publication. <b>The</b> <b>notebooks</b> contain more explicitly anti-Semitic content than Heidegger's previously published writings, reigniting the debate about Heidegger's Nazism and its relationship to his philosophical project.|$|R

5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Mello invades SPK—an {{organization}} {{that aims to}} catch Kira—to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules, which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light. Mello then enlists {{the help of his}} friend Matt to spy on Misa Amane, suspecting she is helping Kira. After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap Kiyomi Takada, Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity. Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do in such a situation. Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; Teru Mikami uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a con artist (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing to an even lower price than her original offer. Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her out of being charged. The same officer drops by the Schrader residence to seek Hank's help by giving him Gale's lab notes to look at. Hank initially shoves away <b>the</b> <b>notebook,</b> but begins to read it later that night.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Notebooks</b> of Henry James {{are private}} notes {{made by the}} American-British novelist and critic. Usually the notes are of a {{professional}} nature and concern ideas for possible or ongoing fictions, {{but there are a}} number of personal notes as well. James made entries in <b>the</b> <b>Notebooks</b> throughout most of his career.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>notebook</b> Kid {{receives}} {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in <b>the</b> <b>notebook,</b> however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. We never see the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, her elder daughter, Denise, kept <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> {{containing}} the manuscript of Suite française {{for fifty years}} without reading it, believing that it would indeed be a journal or diary too painful to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to donate her mother's papers to a French archive, Denise decided to examine <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> first. At last discovering what it contained, she had it published in France in 2004.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> to make him transfer ownership of <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take <b>the</b> <b>notebook,</b> which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E
