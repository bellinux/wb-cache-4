5000|$|In {{descriptions}} of larger corporate structures, the terms [...] "first-tier subsidiary", [...] "second-tier subsidiary", [...] "third-tier subsidiary" [...] etc. {{are often used}} to describe multiple levels of subsidiaries.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of Chinese companies are now taking {{the form of the}} enterprise groups. The enterprise groups often develop in China when <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> set up subsidiaries to enter into new profitable business areas. We interpret this phenomenon as a response to increasing market competition given the still plan-contrained environment such that exit from the old business fields is not easy due to institutional constraints, including social functions attached to the old businesses, such as job provisions. In this case, entry or expansion into new business fields is often accompanied by implicit or explicit asset diversion from <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> to new spin-off firms. This asset diversion tends to lead to the creation of hybrid <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> characterized by low long-term investment ratio and low weight of business income of <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>companies</b> relative to that of the whole group. Whereas this way of group formation by spin-offs can be considered as a'bottom-up' or voluntary response, grouping by the government-initiated M&A and state holding companies is more 'top-down' and seem to be less viable forms. ...|$|R
5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> violated the beverage contracts between various parties.

In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E

Microsoft transitioned its development teams to use its XNA package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the Viva Piñata development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly, as <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>company</b> planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360.
