He flourished under the Buwayhid sultan Majd al-dowleh, {{who died in}} 1029-30AD, and under his successor. He wrote a book on arithmetic in Persian, and then Arabic, entitled the [...] "Satisfying (or Convincing) on Hindu Calculation" [...] (al-muqni fi-l-hisab al Hindi). He also wrote on Archimedes's lemmata and Menelaus's theorem (Kitab al-ishba, or [...] "satiation"), where he made corrections to <b>The</b> <b>Lemmata</b> as translated into Arabic by Thabit ibn Qurra, which was last revised by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.|$|E

It was presumably, therefore, based on a copy of Aldhelm's texts which had interlinear glosses. This glossary or one like it was influential, influencing Byrhtferth of Ramsey and at least one Anglo-Saxon medical text. Kittlick's linguistic investigation showed that some, at least, of the glosses in the Third Cleopatra Glossary are in the Anglian dialect of Old English, with later overlays from West Saxon and Kentish (probably in that order). The glossary--though not necessarily all its entries--must have originated in the eighth century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a group of some twenty-five Old English glosses from the Épinal {{glossary}} (c. 700). The Old English interpretations stand out due to one graphemic feature: they all use one of the runic characters wyn or thorn, which were adopted into the Old English alphabet to represent the phonemes /w/ and /θ/. A careful investigation of the sources of <b>the</b> <b>lemmata</b> reveals that, with three exceptions, these glosses stem from Isidore of Seville’s Etymologiae or from Paulus Orosius’ Historiae Adversum Paganos, but not from any of the other numerous sources of the glossary. This confirms the hypothesis that different orthographic systems were in use among the glossators contributing to the Épinal/Erfurt family of glossaries. The study thus uncovers one chapter in the earliest history of English spelling and contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the composition of Épinal/Erfurt...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} possible benefits of {{natural language processing}} tools, as means to support automated text categorization. Our corpus consists of a small collection of categorized Danish web pages {{in the fields of}} art, architecture, and design. The natural language processing techniques we examine are stop word removal, removal of functional words, and lemmatization. The tools are based on a stop word list, a part-of-speech tagger and a dictionary. We evaluate effects on a string matching classifier and a support vector machine. The classification accuracy increases when using <b>the</b> <b>lemmata,</b> either in addition to or replacing the original inflected words in the documents. Positive effects are seen on both precision and recall. In absence lemmatization, the removal of stop words increases classifier performance, although not as much. Results are valid both for support vector machine, and string matching categorization. Acknowledgments First of all, I would like to thank my main supervisor Pierre Nugues, fo...|$|E

40|$|Preamble. We {{present an}} output-sensitive {{solution}} to the offline variant of the conflict detection and resolution problem for a given set of n 1 D arbitrary range filters R. This Slab-Detect algorithm is applicable to two popular tie-breaking rules {{in the event of}} filter conflicts – the most-specific tie breaking rule (MSTB), and the highest-priority filter rule (HPF). We are able to detect all conflict situations in R and report an optimal number of O(n) slab-resolves to make the set R conflict-free. The algorihm achieves a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and utilises O(n) space.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the long-standing debate {{on the value of}} epigraphic data, {{especially}} in the studies aiming at reconstructing the sociolinguistic framework of Latin, scholars still disagree on the value to be assigned to abnormal (i. e. non classical) spellings occurring in inscriptions. Are they clues suggesting pronunciations re- flecting the social class of the reader/speaker? Are they simple mistakes in writ ing? Are they a sign of the archaizing style typical of the epigraphic register? The paper focuses on the graphemic alternations ˂I˃ ˂E˃ and ˂U˃ ˂O˃ occurring within CLaSSES I, a corpus of inscriptions of the Archaic and Early periods of the Latin language. The distribution of vowel alternations in spelling is not casual, but rather suggests a plausible correspondence in phonological variation. The fine-grained comparison carried out on <b>the</b> <b>lemmata</b> occurring in CLaSSES I reveals a quite complex orthographic picture, where vowel alternations cannot be as- cribable to archaism pure and simple but rather may be interpreted as evidence for a sociophonetic process sensitive to both lexical and prosodic constraints...|$|E

Petri nets, and their monotonic extensions (like Petri nets with non-blocking arcs or Petri nets with transfer arcs), for instance, are special subclasses of well-structured transition systems. We show that the class of well-structured languages enjoy several important closure properties. We propose several pumping lemmata that are applicable respectively to the whole class of well-structured languages and to the classes of languages recognized by Petri nets or Petri nets with non-blocking arcs.
