5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented {{the table to}} illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models {{have been developed to}} explain chemical behavior.|$|E
5|$|Horrocks was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth. He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force that became known as gravity; Isaac Newton in the Principia acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict to confiscate <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin.

5|$|In June 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict {{to close down}} Armenian schools and confiscate <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin.

5|$|Liquid helium {{below its}} lambda point (called heliumII) {{exhibits}} very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when it boils, {{it does not}} bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotope.|$|E
50|$|After the Anschluss and <b>the</b> {{incorporation}} <b>of</b> Austria into Germany, the Steyr Valley Railway {{became part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German National Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn or DR). The Steyr Valley Railway Company was dissolved in 1940, the railway lines became <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DR and thus after 1945 <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ÖBB.|$|R

5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{properties}} of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, {{that led to the}} establishment of the periodic law (<b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main ring can be {{explained}} by the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. <b>The</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. <b>The</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E

5|$|Between 1879 and 1885 {{he served}} as prelate of Van, after which he was forced into exile to Jerusalem. He was elected {{as head of the}} Armenian Church in 1892, however, he was enthroned {{more than a year later}} and served in that {{position}} until his death. He opposed the Russian government's attempt to confiscate <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Church in 1903, which was later canceled partly due to his efforts. Khrimian further endorsed the liberation movement of the Armenian revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important {{to the field of}} medicine.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office and told them to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{development}} of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons {{were found to be}} hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.|$|E
5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under {{the same set of}} views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
