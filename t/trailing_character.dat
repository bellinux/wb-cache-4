40|$|Abstract. As no {{database}} exists without indexes, no index implementation exists without order-preserving key compression, in particular, without prefix {{and tail}} compression. However, despite the great potentials of making indexes smaller and faster, application of general compression methods to ordered data sets has advanced very little. This paper {{demonstrates that the}} fast dictionary-based methods {{can be applied to}} order-preserving compression almost with the same freedom as in the general case. The proposed new technology has the same speed and a compression rate only marginally lower than the traditional order-indifferent dictionary encoding. Procedures for encoding and generating the encode tables are described covering such order-related features as ordered data set restrictions, sensitivity and insensitivity to a character position, and one-symbol encoding of each frequent <b>trailing</b> <b>character</b> sequence. The experimental results presented demonstrate five-folded compression on real-life data sets and twelve-folded compression on Wisconsin benchmark text fields. Key words: Indexing – Order-preserving key compression...|$|E
40|$|By the 1970 s {{the spiral}} subject was in {{considerable}} disarray. The semiempirical theory by Lin and Shu {{was confronted with}} serious problems. They were put on the defensive over their tightly wrapped steady modes on two principal fronts: from the radial propagation at the group velocity that would tend to wind them almost at the material rate, and from the tendencies of galaxy disks toward a strong global instability that appeared likely to overwhelm them. Of course, one might claim that such threats were imaginary and only of academic interest, {{on the ground that}} nature itself had overcome them. One might also be confident that the QSSS hypothesis must be correct as illuminated by the everlasting truth of Hubble's classification. One might even take pride in the fact that a very promising concept developed, although not connected to the wave steadiness, on spiral shocks in interstellar gas and their induced star formation. But such a heuristic approach did not stimulate very strong progress in understanding dynamical principles of the spiral phenomenon; moreover, it often misled, and a rich irony was already that the supposed QSSS favorites M 51 and M 81 turned out most probably not to be quasi-steady at all. A further irony was the continuing failure of Lin and Shu to account the <b>trailing</b> <b>character</b> of their 'modes', while that was already grasped by their direct 'deductive' opponents. But the greatest irony lay {{in the fact that the}} concept later known as swing amplification, worked out by the mid- 1960 s, was originally denigrated by Lin's camp as relating exclusively to 'material arms', whereas it turned out in the end to be of vital importance to this entire spiral enterprise including the variants of chaotic ragged patterns, tidal transient grand designs and growing or quasi-steady modes.
