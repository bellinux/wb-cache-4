5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was swept up in <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was {{subsequently}} awarded the coveted Blood Order, {{even though he was}} {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip, the {{stimulant}} benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme song}} of the Expo, 'Together We'll Show the World!' by Frank Millward and Carol Lloyd, was also an {{important}} rallying point in promoting the Expo in the lead-up to and during phases of the fair, and captured a sense of <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Expo.|$|E

Drum carriers had been used {{for a number of years}} by tenor drum players, however the bass drums and snares continued to use cloth sling harnesses. Through a large amount of experimentation, metal carriers made their debut midway through the 2014 season for halftime and parade use only. The snares and basses are still carried by traditional sling for pregame, due to the visuals done with the drums that add to <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramp entrance.|$|E
25|$|After two hours, {{the whale}} was slowly and gently lifted onto a barge by a crane near Albert Bridge. By this stage there were {{thousands}} of people watching the situation develop from the banks of the river, and the images were seen across the world. <b>The</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge {{to catch a glimpse of}} the barge.|$|E

Women, as they saw their husbands, their fathers, or their brothers slaughtered before them, rushed forward to cling to the arms and bodies of the slayers. One, a maiden of no ordinary beauty, a daughter of Dr. Matthew Griffith, an Anglican clergyman, expelled from the City of London, hearing her father abused and maltreated (he was wounded but not mortally), gave back angry words to his reviler. The incensed soldier, maddened with <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour, struck her on the head, killing her.

25|$|<b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> surfing {{was most}} likely started in New Guinea. It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure.

It is mostly known to be practiced in Hawaii and the surrounding islands, but it has spread to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continents. It was not widely accepted by Europeans because it took time away from working and labor, although they enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> seeing <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> surfing.|$|R
500|$|Hemingway {{began writing}} the novel on his {{birthday}} (21July) in 1925, finishing the draft manuscript barely two months later in September. After setting aside the manuscript for a short period, he worked on revisions {{during the winter of}} 1926. The basis for the novel was Hemingway's 1925 trip to Spain. [...] The setting was unique and memorable, showing seedy café life in Paris, and <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pamplona festival, with a middle section devoted to descriptions of a fishing trip in the Pyrenees. Hemingway's sparse writing style, combined with his restrained use of description to convey characterizations and action, became known as demonstrating the Iceberg Theory.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{commented on}} the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network (ANN) felt that {{the result was a}} strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for ANN, {{suggested}} that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. [...] Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as [...] "dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling".|$|E
2500|$|... "When {{we started}} the Orange Tree Theatre in 1971, we only wanted to put on plays. There was no {{political}} or social aim, nor did we philosophise about theatre-in-the-round or a style of minimal theatre. There was no money for stage lights or a raised stage, so we performed by daylight on the same floor level as the seating. And we discovered <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> audience part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action."

[...] House of Moves were used to assist in creation motion capture for the on-screen animations.

500|$|Zelda {{remained}} in the hospital while Scott returned to Hollywood for a $1,000-a-week job with MGM in June 1937. Without Zelda's knowledge, he began a serious affair with the movie columnist Sheilah Graham. Despite <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair, Scott was bitter and burned out. When their daughter Scottie {{was thrown out of}} her boarding school in 1938, he blamed Zelda. Though Scottie was subsequently accepted by Vassar College, his resentment of Zelda was stronger than ever before. Of Scott's mindset, Milford wrote, [...] "The vehemence of his rancor toward Zelda was clear. It was she who had ruined him; she who had made him exhaust his talents... He had been cheated of his dream by Zelda." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{much about}} the {{subculture}} surrounding handfishing, the film documents this practice of wading in murky water and sticking your hand into dark holes hoping a 30 lb plus catfish will latch onto your hand and arm.

500|$|The film {{received}} {{praise from}} critics with The Moving Picture World stating, [...] " [...] picture which touches {{the heart and}} arouses the strongest emotions. It can be readily understood how a man might become a maniac under such circumstances. The loss of a wife and daughter is sufficient to overthrow reason. That a man should be a hermit afterward seems not unusual. Then comes <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> runaway, the rescue of the baby and the discovery of his daughter, with returning reason and love to follow during his declining years. The emotions will be strongly aroused by this picture, and {{that will make it}} popular. Whatever touches the heart is always popular, and this seems to appeal with unusual power."

500|$|Other {{characters}} catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, {{the widow}} {{who runs the}} carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. [...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying {{to the rhythm of}} Billy's spiel. [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. [...] They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.|$|E

In front of a couple of thousand spectators, with the game being called on the public address system by a television sports commentator, Allan Terry, the Australians beat the English by a single basket (20-18). The atmosphere was summarised in The Australian Paraplegic: [...] "The spectacle of the opening ceremony and wheelpast, followed by <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basketball, sent spectators home well rewarded for their attendance at the opening day of the First Commonwealth Paraplegic Games."
