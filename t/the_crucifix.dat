5|$|Before the Protestant Reformation, <b>the</b> <b>crucifix</b> {{was common}} in Western Christianity. It {{is a model}} of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. <b>The</b> <b>crucifix</b> became the central {{ornament}} of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} {{religious convictions}} {{have been much}} debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as <b>the</b> <b>crucifix),</b> and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} wall, {{there is a}} niche that holds a statue of <b>the</b> <b>crucifix</b> with a Christ image sculpted in ivory. Behind this, is another mural that depicts the Juan Diego's of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crucifix</b> was {{installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; <b>the</b> <b>Crucifix</b> lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to seek help, Dinah stabs {{herself with}} the cruifix piece, {{allowing}} her to temporarily ascend into the afterlife. There, she encounters her mother, who gives her another mausoleum seed that Dinah takes back to the living world. Dinah uses the seed to revive everyone killed in the incident and her armor melts into coins that flow out of the fountain. But in the end, Dinah opts to remove <b>the</b> <b>crucifix</b> piece, killing her.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of <b>the</b> <b>Crucifix</b> has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crucifix</b> by Cimabue at Santa Croce (c. 1265) is {{a wooden}} crucifix, painted in distemper, {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It {{is one of the}} first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crucifix</b> {{measures}} 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E
5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches a glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>crucifix</b> she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E

At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were <b>the</b> <b>crucifixes</b> she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, <b>the</b> <b>crucifixes</b> seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|R
5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing <b>the</b> <b>crucifix,</b> bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>crucifix</b> is a {{principal}} symbol for many groups of Christians, {{and one of the}} most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts. It is especially important in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, but is also used in the Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, and Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as by many Lutheran and Anglican churches. The symbol is less common in churches of other Protestant denominations, which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the corpus). <b>The</b> <b>crucifix</b> emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice — his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than any other shape, such as a Tau cross or a Coptic cross.|$|E
