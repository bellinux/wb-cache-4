50|$|A {{key driver}} of SMRs are the alleged {{improved}} economies of scale, compared to larger reactors, that {{stem from the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> them in a manufacturing plant/factory. A key disadvantage, however, is that these improved economics can only be realised if the factory is built in the first place, and {{this is likely to}} require initial orders for an 40-70 units, which some experts think unlikely.|$|E
50|$|Construction is offsite, using lean {{manufacturing}} techniques <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. PMC buildings are manufactured {{in a controlled}} setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on assembly lines. Modules' construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with MEP, fixtures and interior finishes.|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyConventional business procedures are increasingly being replaced by dynamic and revolutionized growth due to the integration of Information and Communication technologies to meet changing business requirements. For survival in this highly competitive field of construction, the adaptation of new technologies enhancement and its revolution is considered as an essential requirement. Emerging ICT developments and new construction techniques have generated much needed discussion about how these two streams are connected together. The concept of prefabrication has grown {{in recent years to}} change conventional construction processes and simultaneously Building Information Model (BIM) has emerged to brighten up traditionally ill functioned business communication flow. Building Information Modelling in the early stage of building construction development provides the vehicle to bring the construction industry into line with other technically driven fields, such as Automotive and Aerospace. However, in the past this has not given much consideration towards interaction between itself and the much improved construction industry prefabrication process. This research has reviewed the current state of BIM capability in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) professions and establishes what is technologically possible. It also closely scrutinises one of the leading UK‟s cold rolled steel prefabricator‟s design and manufacturing process. The result of the findings leads the research to undertake in-depth benchmarking process to review and select an appropriate BIM application for live implementation. Upon selection, BIM application is customised to cater current and future design process of the above SME unit and implemented within a live construction project environment. Latest design process within SME unit along with BIM solution then evaluated against commercial criteria which determine the validity of incorporating construction industry prefabricating processes into current BIM applications iiand highlighted its overall benefits for the prefabricators and construction industry as a whole. Latter part of the research investigated the latest technological advancement available within BIM applications. Review has lead to highlight Application Programming Interface (API) available within the BIM applications. API provided much needed control mechanism to end users via standard programming mechanisms which captured during this research as the gateway <b>to</b> incorporate <b>prefabricating</b> information into BIM. Future Novel Framework developed based on API capabilities of the BIM applications in order <b>to</b> incorporate <b>prefabricating</b> processes into BIM Application...|$|R
40|$|This paper traces {{a history}} of war-induced {{scarcity}} through the material and technological properties of household appliances and kitchens from 1914 to 1930. Investigating the Austrian settlement and allotment garden movement, it argues that the practices of users, self-help builders, and inhabitants who reacted to living with limited resources {{in the state of}} emergency found their way into the designs of modern homes, and into the works of canonical modern architecture, in particular the famous Frankfurt Kitchen. This paper thus investigates the design and production of the modern kitchen and its transformations, from Vienna to Frankfurt, moving from a cooperative vernacular building movement to one of the largest construction endeavors <b>to</b> standardize and <b>prefabricate</b> modern housing in Germany...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1944 the IJN {{decided it}} needed large numbers of {{high-speed}} coastal submarines {{in preparation for the}} allied Operation Downfall. 79 boats were planned under the Maru Sen Programme (Boat #4911-4989), however only 9 boats were completed by the end of war. The Japanese navy planned <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> large sections of the boats, then finish the boats in the slipway. This was ambitious considering the allied bombing campaign that was disrupting Japanese production. These submarines displayed many of the same advanced ideas implemented on the German Type XXI and Type XXIII submarines.|$|E

The Secretary of Māori Affairs, Tamati Reedy, was negotiating as Māori Trustee, but had been counselled against the proposed loan by Graham Scott of Treasury in November. Senior departmental officials had attended a series of meetings in Hawaii, and been introduced to the participants by Rocky Cribb, a businessman from Rotorua.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Dundee on 25 March 1868, {{the son of}} a plasterer, Clarks {{family moved}} to London when he was still young. In 1913 Clark joined with Harry Fenn, a surveyor, {{founding}} a company at Loughborough Junction to specialise in ornamental fibrous plasterwork and Plaster of Paris work. The business was a rapid success with commissions from the new cinemas and major theatres who competed against each other through the splendour of their interior decoration. For designs, Clark & Fenn worked closely with G. Jackson & Sons, founded in 1780 with Robert Adam as a designer. The company soon moved to larger premises at Clapham Old Town where they were able <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> much of their work off-site. This allowed them to take the mouldings ready-prepared for installation to a theatre or cinema, minimising the disruption to performances and rehearsals.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{was founded}} by Dick Dusseldorp in 1951 {{on behalf of the}} Dutch {{building}} companies Bredero's Bouwbedrijf of Utrecht and The Royal Dutch Harbour Company as an Australian-based building contractor. Its first contract was to supply and erect 200 prefabricated houses for the Snowy Mountains’ Authority which had been established by William Hudson, engineer of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Hudson's greatest obstacle in the completion of the scheme was the provision of labour and materials. Without a resolution to these two problems the realisation of the project was doubtful. But 31-year-old Dutch immigrant Dick Dusseldorp conceived a plan <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> frames for worker housing in Finland, plumbing in England, ship materials via Cooma and recruit labour from the Netherlands to erect the homes. Dusseldorp established 'Civil and Civic' to take on and manage the multimillion-dollar contract.|$|E
50|$|Earlier Mohammed Yusuf Khatri and {{his family}} used <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> {{different}} traditional dresses for the persons belonging to different castes living in tribal area of Bagh block of Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. Because the people of different castes and families had different dresses like Maroo, Jat, Meghwal, Mahajan, Bhil, Bhilala society and they were identified with their dresses. After 1990 Mohammed Yusuf Khatri did new experiments on the clothes for urban market. He did block printing with hand and designed cultural clothing firstly.He also experimented incorporating modernity in the wooden blocks and colours {{in such a way}} that its fame and popularity could be established for a long time on the national and international level.He proved his imagination true by making craft on bamboo mat, leather, jute etc. besides cloth, Bagh Print was engraved with natural colours on bamboo chick. This was the first experiment of the world which was completed with colours on bamboo mat.It is notable that before or after popularity of Bagh print in the world, no example of such kind is recorded. Hence it is the first sample of such art in the world. It is truly a revolutionary invention in India.|$|E
50|$|In 1596, James Burbage {{acquired}} {{part of the}} old Blackfriars priory, where {{a company}} of child actors, The Children of the Chapel, was already established in another of the old buildings. As Burbage was commissioning alterations to his purchase, to add galleries and extra seating for his intended audience, Street acquired a house and waterfront woodyard near Bridewell, just over the River Fleet from Burbage's purchase and directly connected by a narrow bridge. (Details of the complicated leasing arrangements for Street's new property survive, as the head lessee died just after accepting a deposit for arranging the transaction and a court case was necessary to resolve the issue.) Although no documentary record specifying Street's involvement with the Blackfriars project has been found, it is assumed that he acquired the woodyard so that he could be close to the site of his new contract. A waterfront yard was necessary as Street stayed in Berkshire, near to where his timber was grown, <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> the components for his timber-framed buildings in London, and then transported the pieces by barge down the Thames to where they were needed. Burbage discharged him before the friary project was completed, as influential local residents had petitioned to prevent the Burbages' plan.|$|E
5000|$|A steel {{treadway}} bridge needed floating pontoons. A saddles {{on top of}} the pontoon put {{the weight}} of the bridge on the pontoon. A 12-foot sections of treadway track was bolted to the saddles. The treadway sections were put together on the spot unloaded for many truck. The sections were taken out {{to the end of the}} bridge in construction. The sections were connected together with large steel pins. The 17th was experienced with treadway bridges, but this was the largest one. To cross the Rhine would need 80 or 90 sections to complete the bridge. Moving the sections then pounding in the large pins was hard work. These bridge could carry a heavy load including a 66,800 pound M4 tanks. The floating pontoon was an 18-ton pressurized rubber bag. The saddle was the metal and plywood frame was placed on the float and supported the treadway tracks. <b>To</b> <b>prefabricate</b> the bridge the pontoon had to be inflated; the saddles had to be assembled and lashed to the top of the pontoon. On 30 March 1945 Company [...] "C", constructed a treadway bridge across the canal near Alvert. On 5 April 1945, the 17th Engr. Bn. constructed a 384 treadway across the Weser at Ohr, Germany. On 8 April 1945 division engineers constructed a pontoon bridge across the Weser Elbe Canal, west of, Harsum allowing Company [...] "A" [...] to continue its drive northeast to Braunschweig.|$|E

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of composite bridges depends on several circumstances such as site conditions, local costs {{of material and}} staff and the contractor's experience. One major advantage compared to concrete bridges is that the steel girders can carry {{the weight of the}} formwork and the wet concrete. Another advantage is the savings in construction time, which saves some money for the contractor but even more so for the road users, a fact that usually is neglected when evaluating alternative bridge designs. A further step to improve the {{competitiveness of}} composite bridges is <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> not only the steel girders, but also the concrete deck.

40|$|Every day the {{construction}} industry is looking {{for new ways to}} improve time efficiency and project profitability. Companies in the past have tried value engineering and schedule crashing to save time and money. As the industry continues to grow and innovate, new concepts are being applied. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is one of these ideas that has made a large impact in {{the construction}} industry. BIM is a digital 3 D modeling system that allows the user to create a complete rendering of a construction project complete with mechanical, electrical, and plumbing integrated into the model. With this model a prospective contractor has the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> aspects of their project in a shop to later be installed on site more efficiently and with less labor necessary than if completely field fabricated. The fire sprinkler contractor JR Wagner Fire Protection has recently integrated prefabrication as a possible project delivery method for several of their recent projects. Possible benefits from their integration include reduction in project cost and shorter project schedule leading to greater company profitability and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary field promising new therapeutic means for replacing lost or severely damaged tissues or organs. However, the fabrication of complex engineered tissues has been hampered {{due to the}} lack of vascularization to provide sufficient blood supply after implantation. In this article, we propose using rapid prototyping technology <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> a scaffold with an inside hollowed vascular system including an arterial end, a venous end and capillary networks between them. The scaffold will be ''printed'' layer by layer. When printing every layer, a ''low-melting point'' material will be used to form a blood vessel network and a tissue-specific material will be used outside it. Hereafter the ‘low-melting point’ material will be evacuated by vaporization to ensure a hollowed vessel network. Then the inside hollowed capillary network can be endothelialized by using autologous endothelial cells in a cycling bioreactor while the outside material can be embedded with tissue-special cells. In the end, the new vascularized autologous grafts could be transferred to the defect site by using microsurgical techniques to connect the grafts with the host artery and vein. The strategy would facilitate construction of complex tissue engineering if the hypothesis proved to be practical...|$|E
40|$|Industrialized housing {{has been}} a common {{phenomenon}} in the building industry since the industrial revolution; the casting of iron components enabled Victorian iron casters <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> entire buildings and to export them to all British colonies. It got a second boost from Modernist architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Konrad Wachsmann; and a third boost in the US when the soldiers {{came back from the}} Second World War in 1945 and wanted to buy a ready-made house. In the later decades of the 20 th century composite prototypes were built. Timber frame houses are extremely popular in low density areas worldwide. For densely populated areas housing is now firmly attached to reinforced concrete. The contracting industries have developed efficient building methods for the concrete structures on which separate systems of claddings are fixed to form a house. However, in the coming decades, designers, builders and scientists also have to keep the environment in mind, working with a minimal amount of materials, and for minimizing embodied energy and energy use. In the coming age minimal embodied energy and low ecological footprints are renewed values that will be added to energy-positive housing and that will have an influence on the building technology of the future. This will lead to a reformation of the building vocabulary. Other materials will have to be chosen and developed to function in building elements and components.

40|$|Background: One {{strategy}} to reconstruct large bone defects is <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate</b> a vascularized flap by implanting a biomaterial scaffold with associated biologics into the latissimus dorsi and then transplanting this construct to the defect site after a maturation period. This strategy, similar to all clinically and regulatory feasible biologic approaches to surgical reconstruction, requires {{the ability to}} quickly (< 1 ?h within an operating room) and efficiently bind biologics to scaffolds. It also requires the ability to localize biologic delivery. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of binding bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP 2) to poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) using adsorption and conjugation {{as a function of}} time. Methods: BMP 2 was adsorbed (Ads) or conjugated (Conj) to PCL scaffolds with the same three-dimensional printed architecture while altering exposure time (0. 5, 1, 5, and 16 ?h), temperature (4 °C, 23 °C), and BMP 2 concentration (1. 4, 5, 20, and 65 ??g/mL). The in vitro release was quantified, and C 2 C 12 cell alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression was used to confirm bioactivity. Scaffolds with either 65 or 20 ??g/mL Ads or Conj BMP 2 for 1 ?h at 23 °C were implanted subcutaneously in mice to evaluate in vivo bone regeneration. Micro-computed tomography, compression testing, and histology were performed to characterize bone regeneration. Results: After 1 ?h exposure to 65 ??g/mL BMP 2 at 23 °C, Conj and Ads resulted in 12. 83 ± 1. 78 and 10. 78 ± 1. 49 ??g BMP 2 attached, respectively. Adsorption resulted in a positive ALP response and had a small burst release; whereas conjugation provided a sustained release with negligible ALP production, indicating that the conjugated BMP 2 may not be bioavailable. Adsorbed 65 ??g/mL BMP 2 solution resulted in the greatest regenerated bone volume (15. 0 ± 3. 0 ?mm 3), elastic modulus (20. 1 ± 3. 0 ?MPa), and %bone ingrowth in the scaffold interior (17. 2 %± 5. 4 %) when compared with conjugation. Conclusion: Adsorption may be optimal for the clinical application of prefabricating bone flaps due to BMP 2 binding in a short exposure time, retained BMP 2 bioactivity, and bone growth adhering to scaffold geometry and into pores with healthy marrow development...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to reduce the cost}} of breakwaters, several {{elements}} have been developed. Examples are Accropodes, Tetrapods and concrete cubes. Previous tests were performed with armour layers consisting of a double layer of cubes. This study is based on a single layer of cubes. The great benefit of a single layer of cubes is that it reduces the total cost of concrete. Another benefit is that because of the shape, cubes are easy <b>to</b> <b>prefabricate.</b> Three important aspects considering the stability of a single armour layer of a breakwater consisting of concrete cubes are addressed: The influence of the wave steepness on the stqbility, the influence of the slope on the stability of the single armour layer, and the influence of the packing density on the stability of the single armour layer. This study is based on a literature study and the results from a test program including a small-scale physical model tests. All conclusions in this thesis have been based on model tests, in which the cubes were placed by hand and placed in a stretching bond (half-steensverband). In total eighteen tests were performed in the wave flume of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences. Two different slopes were tested together with three different packing densities and three different wave steepness. It was found that the gentler slope did not contribute to the stability in this setting using a stretching bond. In fact the model failed earlier than the model with a steeper slope in most cases. The best results were found using a slope of cot? = 1. 5. Secondly, the influence of the packing density showed varying failure mechanism. When applying a large packing density (np = 0. 20) the damage occurred below SWL. Contrary to small packing densities (np = 0. 35) where damage occurred higher than SWL. It was found that, from the tested packing densities, a packing density of 0. 28 gives the best results for both slopes. This conclusion is conform the findings of previous tests [Van Gent et al, 1999]. During these tests an optimum packing density of np = 0. 25 – 0. 30 was found. Although the cubes were placed randomly in the tests of Van Gent. In this study the cubes were placed in a stretching bond. Finally it was found that a wave steepness of s 0 p = 0. 04 - 0. 05 causes minimum stability for the armour layer. The tests with a single armour layer of cubes placed in a stretching bond indicated that high sta-bility numbers (Hs/?Dn) can be reached before failure occurs (Nod > 0. 2). the tests show that sta-bility numbers as high as 4. 5 can be realized before Nod > 0. 2 is reached. This study shows that the use of a single top layer of cubes is feasible. The top layer becomes very stable when placed in a stretching bond. In this configuration it is recommended to use a single top layer of cubes instead of a double top layer of cubes. The results during the tests seem to have a strong correlation with pitched stones. Therefore the black box model as well as the analytical method for pitched stones (6 -xi-rule) is treated in {{an attempt to}} optimize the design rules for different configurations. Finally, in combination with an adjusted 6 -xi-rule and the formulae from Van der Meer for loose rock, formulae were developed based on curve fitting.
