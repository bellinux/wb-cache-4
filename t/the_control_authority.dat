50|$|AAW {{developed}} from the simple observation that the aeroelasticity can be offset by the deployment of other control surfaces on the wing. In particular, almost all modern aircraft use some form of slat along the wing's leading edge to provide more lift during certain portions of flight. By deploying the slats {{at the same time}} as the ailerons, the torque can be equalled out on either side of the spars, eliminating the twisting, which improves <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> of the ailerons. This means that less aileron input is needed to produce a given motion, which, in turn, will reduce aileron drag and its associated negative control aspects. Better yet, the wing is already designed to be extremely strong in the lift component, eliminating the torque requires lift, converting the undesired torque into an acceptable lift component.|$|E

Scaling of the guidance forces determines <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> of the support system. As task complexity may vary, one level of the guidance scaling may be insufficient, and adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> may be helpful. The available literature mostly proposed to adapt the authority based on external cues (e. g. actual performance or safety) and the user had no direct way to modulate the desired level of support. In this paper we investigated a variable authority guidance scheme based on the user grip force. During a user study (with 8 subjects) we explored two opposite approaches to trade <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> (i. e. increasing or decreasing guidance force magnitude with increased user grip). To simulate increased task difficulty and imperfections of the haptic guidance system, at random times either an unpredictable force disturbance was added or subjects were presented with incorrect guidance. While the performance differences between the fixed- and the variable-authority schemes were not significant, the "decreasing guidance with increased user grip" scheme allowed to substantially reduce the user control effort (steering force), especially when the guidance system was incorrect. The presented method essentially provides additional control over the guidance system without reducing the performance...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes a}} computational study undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of a flow control mechanism and its associated aerodynamics for a finned projectile. The flow control system consists of small microflaps located between the rear fins of the projectile. These small microflaps alter the flow field in the aft finned region of the projectile, create asymmetric pressure distributions, and thus produce aerodynamic control forces and moments. A number of different geometric parameters, microflap locations, and the number of microflaps were varied in an attempt to maximize <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> generated by the flaps. Steady-state Navier-Stokes computations were performed to obtain the control aerodynamic forces and moments associated with the microflaps. These results were used to optimize <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> at a supersonic speed, M= 2. 5. Computed results showed not only the microflaps to be effective at this speed, but also configurations with 6 and 8 microflaps were found to generate 25 %– 50 % more control force than a baseline 4 -flap configuration. These results led to a new optimized 8 -flap configuration that was further investigated for a range of Mach numbers from M= 0. 8 to 5. 0 and was found to be a viable configuration effective in providing control at all of these speeds...|$|E

The appropriate form of the control signal and associated phase is suggested by the dynamics at reduced orders, determined by a multiple-scales perturbation analysis directly applied to the integral-partial-differential equations of motion and boundary conditions.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{open-loop}} control strategy {{applied to a}} planar pendulum subjected to the most severe com-bination of base excitations, horizontal motion at the primary-resonance frequency, and vertical motion at the principal-parametric resonance frequency is developed. The control action is typical of many single-input control systems; <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> in one direction (horizontal) is high, and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> in the or-thogonal direction (vertical) is zero in a linear sense. Although {{the action of the}} controller is linearly orthog-onal to part (vertical or parametric) of the system excitation, effects are transferred to this direction through nonlinear actuator action. Proper enhancement of the control input allows the nonlinear action to provide con-trol authority over the parametric excitation. The dynamics at reduced orders, determined by a multiple-scales perturbation analysis, suggest the appropriate form for the control enhancement. The normal form of the sys-tem provides information about how each parameter of the enhancement affects the steady-state pendulation of the system. In this case, heuristic arguments are used to reduce the dimension of the unknown enhance-ment design parameters to a manageable size. The maximum pendulation angle of the steady-state motion of the system is one of the appropriate metrics for the system response; here it is used as the cost function for evaluation of the optimal enhancement gains. Because the size of the design parameter set has been re-duced, a simple grid search is employed to find the optimal control. Relative to simple linear cancellatio...|$|E

40|$|Active {{flow control}} systems have the {{potential}} to allow future designs of ground vehicles and aircraft to realise increased operational efficiency through improved optimisation of the flow, leading to decreased fuel use and reduced environmental impact. To achieve this, dynamic actuators are required that can adapt to the changing conditions experienced over low-speed, high-lift aerofoils where separation control can be particularly advantageous. Synthetic Jet Actuators (SJAs) are a form of the technology that shows promise; they are small, low-mass and low-power devices, which means that they can potentially realise the system efficiency a vehicular application of active flow control requires. The aims of this research were directed to achieving better understanding and robustness of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> from SJA systems at Reynolds Numbers close to real-world operations. The characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> from a round-orifice SJA array positioned near the leading-edge position of an NACA 0015 aerofoil have been investigated at Re = O(10 ^ 6). Measurements demonstrated how the jet flow imparts a controlling mechanism over the separating boundary layer flow, and hence can be used to improve the overall efficiency of the wing. A series of parametric alterations to the test conditions was made {{in order to understand the}} robustness of the control effect. The forcing frequency was decoupled from the dynamic response of the actuators themselves by means of amplitude modulation. The results demonstrated that successful control could be achieved with significantly reduced input power requirements, improving net efficiency. The effectiveness was shown to be largely independent of the frequency when used in this way. Using a counterstreamwise jet orientation to control the same basic separated flow condition was not found to generate significant improvements in operational efficiency. The results suggest an in-depth understanding of the jet flow, and the excitation location in relation to the point where the flow separates is important when designing the actuators. Tests also considered a different flow condition with a stronger adverse pressure gradient, by generating a ground-effect flow over the suction surface. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> afforded was diminished in the more adverse flow states. The performance of the actuators was considered, and the system achieved a larger than unity Figure of Merit, indicating the overall benefit of control shows direct relevance for realising practical flow control systems. The results indicate arrays of SJA’s are capable of delivering energy savings when managing this type of flow...|$|E
