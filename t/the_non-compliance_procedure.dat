40|$|In this essay, {{the author}} assesses the {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Non-Compliance</b> <b>Procedure</b> of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. Although in operation for only six years, the Procedure and its standing Implementation Committee have already {{made significant contributions to}} the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol. The Implementation Committee serves as a forum for discussing compliance-related issues; it has {{played a central role in}} managing individual cases of compliance. The author applies some lessons from the Montreal Protocol experience to the design of noncompliance procedures and similar mechanisms in other multilateral environmental agreements. He focuses on the Multilateral Consultative Process (Article 13) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ...|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol is {{praised by}} some {{scholars}} and criticized by others. This paper evaluates the enforcement mechanisms comprising monitoring and noncompliance procedures {{based on an}} informal game theoretic analysis. It is argued that the monitoring system has achieved an unprecedented level of sophistication. It also appears that <b>the</b> <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedures</b> have achieved a remarkable quality (in particular when judged in view of past international environmental treaties) {{in terms of their}} deterrence potential and credibility, though there is room for improvement. Possibilities for improvement are outlined and possible supplemental <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedures</b> are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{remarkable}} success, {{the model}} of <b>the</b> Montreal Protocol's <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedure</b> (NCP) has been adopted in other environmental regimes, whose primary norms differ considerably. Hence, this article distinguishes different types of global environmental regimes and assesses the performance of NCPs therein as endogenous enforcement mechanisms. In fact, the reciprocal nature of the main conventional obligations in some more recent environmental regimes seems to hamper the effectiveness of compliance procedures. On this basis, the article puts forward some tentative considerations from a constitutional perspective. Drawing from the experience gained under environmental regimes {{in the region of}} the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), it explores the feasibility of transplanting some aspects of {{the model of}} the Aarhus Convention NCP into the more complex global context. Further, it reflects upon the potential of enhancing synergies between NCPs and national and international judiciaries as a step towards the consolidation of international public law in this area...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to address <b>the</b> issue of <b>non-compliance</b> with {{international}} child labor standards in the Indian case. In order to do this I took a social constructivist approach to analyzing and explaining human behavior, utilizing methods of process tracing and secondary case study analysis. I first looked at why states ratifY treaties embodying international child labor standards but fail to comply with them. I then evaluated {{the viability of the}} popular legal positivist proposal to bring about compliance by linking non-compliance with economic sanctions. My findings demonstrated that <b>the</b> reason for <b>non-compliance</b> is that there are strong norms within the Indian social structure which support the practice of child labor, in direct contrast to the international treaties prohibiting child labor. Thus, I concluded that <b>the</b> linkage of <b>non-compliance</b> and economic sanctions would be ineffective because sanctions would do little to address the cause of <b>the</b> <b>non-compliance...</b>|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to the process of}} reaching agreements is the publication of templates that guide parties to create agreement offers that are then sent for approval to the template publisher. in such scenario, a common issue the template publisher must address is to check whether the agreement offer received is compliant or not with the template. Furthermore, in the latter case, an automated explanation of the reasons of such non-compliance is very appealing. Unfortunately, although there are proposals that deal with checking the compliance, the problem of providing an automated explanation to <b>the</b> <b>non-compliance</b> has not yet been studied in this context. in this paper, we take a subset of the WS-Agreement recommendation as a starting point and we provide a rigorous definition of the explanation for <b>the</b> <b>non-compliance</b> between templates and agreement offers. Furthermore, we propose the use of constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solvers to implement it and provide a proof-of-concept implementation. The advantage of using CSPs is that it allows expressive service level objectives inside SLAs...|$|R

The decision rule proposed in Wallonia, Belgium, for <b>the</b> <b>non-compliance</b> of waste incineration plants with the EU limit value for PCDD and PCDF emissions is presented. The method uncertainty was estimated annually over 6 years from duplicate measurements using two top-down approaches. Depending on the congener, the standard uncertainty varies from 30 to 85 %, with a good correlation between calculations. The analytical contribution was estimated using a bottom-up evaluation. The impact of the sampling step was deduced from the whole estimation and represents more than 80 % of the total uncertainty budget. No optimisation is foreseen at this time because of practical field constraints. Based on the average fraction of each congener, the uncertainty associated with the measurement result has been established and shows a high stability over the years. Using this value, a guard band has been calculated and will be proposed to the regulatory body. Peer reviewe...|$|R
