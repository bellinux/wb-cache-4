5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{smell is}} {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity.

40|$|International audienceWord sense {{induction}} (WSI) is {{the task}} aimed at automatically identifying <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> words in texts, {{without the need for}} handcrafted resources or annotated data. Up till now, most WSI algorithms extract <b>the</b> different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a word 'locally' on a per-word basis, i. e. <b>the</b> different <b>senses</b> for each word are determined separately. In this paper, we compare the performance of such algorithms to an algorithm that uses a 'global' approach, i. e. <b>the</b> different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a particular word are determined by comparing them to, and demarcating them from, <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> other words in a full-blown word space model. We adopt the evaluation framework proposed in the SemEval- 2010 Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation task. All systems that participated in this task use a local scheme for determining <b>the</b> different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a word. We compare their results to the ones obtained by the global approach, and discuss the advantages and weaknesses of both approaches...|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. <b>The</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} work, cadmium ion-imprinted {{polymers}} based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-IIP) for <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> cadmium ions {{have been developed}} using cadmium ion as a template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, and N,N′methylene-bis-acrylamide (NNMBA) as a cross linking agent. For smooth interaction and bonding between carbon nanotubes and polymer, MWCNTs are modified with carboxyl functional group which is then converted into acid chloride group and finally to vinyl-functionalized MWCNT. Then, NNMBA and MAA would copolymerize with vinyl groups {{on the surface of}} MWCNTs, forming uniform IIP layer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique are used for <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> Cd(II) ions using modified platinum electrode (Lee et al. 2016 b; Roy et al. 2014). The potential for <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> MWCNT-IIP-Pt towards Cd(II) ion was tried against real samples. Subsequent to <b>the</b> flourishing <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> Cd(II) ion, MWCNT-IIP was also utilized for the extraction of Cd(II) ions from the same sample itself.|$|R
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique.

McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem {{to have found a}} home on page eleven.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
