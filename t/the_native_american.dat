50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> traded furs {{and food}} with the Dutch for various goods. In return the Dutch gave <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> metal pots, knives, guns, axes, and blankets. Trading with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{occurred}} until 1643 when {{a series of}} wars broke out between <b>the</b> Dutch and <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to <b>the</b> war. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> modeled on <b>the</b> Franco-Native alliance.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} English fur traders help pay <b>the</b> rents for <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{in order to}} prevent tobacco farmers from driving <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> off of their lands. Nonetheless, English tobacco farmers {{gradually}} acquired more and more land from <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> which hindered <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> from moving around freely in search of food. While the English had established treaties with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> that protected their rights to [...] "hunting, fowling, crabbing, and fishing", in practice the English did not respect the treaties and <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were eventually moved to reservations.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{territory}} was created, {{there were only three}} American settlements in what would later become the Indiana Territory, Vincennes, Kaskaskia and Clark's Grant. The entire population was under five-thousand Europeans. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> population was estimated to be near twenty-thousand, but possibly as high as seventy-five thousand.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the United Church of Christ General Synod {{passed a}} {{resolution}} calling for a stop to using images or mascots that could be demeaning to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> community.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> {{name of the}} Snake River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived at}} its mouth by boat in 1800. When the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed westwards into the Snake River watershed in 1805, they first gave it the name Lewis River, Lewis Fork or Lewis's Fork, as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river.|$|E
50|$|Edmund and Francis, {{arriving}} in (Saugus) Lynn, were received kindly by <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> who {{were of the}} Pawtucket tribe, and <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> gave them leave to dwell there and occupy what land they would.|$|R
2500|$|In The Generall Historie, Smith {{implies that}} the Virginia colonists resented <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> and <b>the</b> two peoples had mostly hostile {{feelings}} towards each other. [...] He compares Chief Powhatan to the devil, and refers to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as [...] "barbarians". Numerous times, he mentions sending spies to discover the Chief's intent and declining Powhatan's request to relinquish their arms. He also stresses the many experiences where <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> threatened and attempted to kill him.|$|R
50|$|The Preacher {{leaves the}} group and stalks Buck when he leaves {{to make a deal}} with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> pursue <b>the</b> Preacher and Buck bargains with them for {{protection}} of the wagon group. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> are portrayed as shrewd bargainers who constantly haggle for a better deal with Buck. After reaching an agreement, the Preacher has a new-found respect for Buck because of his hard work effort and desire to help the traveling freed slaves.|$|R
5|$|In 1817 Major Stephen H. Long of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led a {{waterborne}} expedition from Prairie du Chien {{to reach}} Saint Anthony Falls.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Franco-Spanish expedition, Carolinians led Native American raiding expeditions that besieged Pensacola, {{one of the few}} remaining Spanish outposts in Florida. They also mobilized Native American forces to attack Mobile, but these efforts were frustrated by French diplomatic activities in <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> communities and also by false rumors of another Franco-Spanish expedition.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that Point du Sable married a Potawatomi woman named Kitihawa (Christianized to Catherine) on October 27, 1788 in a Catholic {{ceremony}} in Cahokia, an old French missionary town on the Mississippi River, though they were likely married earlier in the 1770s in <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tradition. They had a son named Jean and a daughter named Susanne.|$|E

2500|$|From 1611 to 1614, the Dutch {{established}} the colony of New Netherland, which claimed territory between the 40th and 45th parallel north, a zone which included northern New Jersey. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> traded furs and food with the Dutch for various goods. In return the Dutch gave <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> metal pots, knives, guns, axes, and blankets. Trading with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> occurred until 1643 when {{a series of}} wars broke out between <b>the</b> Dutch and <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> [...] There were hostile relations between <b>the</b> Dutch and <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> between 1643 and 1660. This prevented colonization by the Dutch of the Morris County region which was technically included in their claimed [...] "New Netherland." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> in Suffolk County, {{as opposed}} to Nassau County (then a part of Queens County) got along well with the white English. In the Dutch west end of Long Island there was bitter {{fighting}} between <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> and <b>the</b> Dutch.|$|R
5|$|Shattuck argued Oneida I alone {{before the}} Supreme Court. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Rights Fund (NARF), which had {{assisted}} initially assisted the firm, served as co-counsel {{in the trial}} after the Oneida I decision and took over completely on the second appeal. The NARF also filed another suit behalf of the Oneidas, pressing the Oneida's possessory claims against landowners over additional lands.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{contains}} two National Scenic Byways. The Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway {{is in the}} Black Hills, while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Scenic Byway runs along the Missouri River in the north-central part of the state.

5|$|The annual {{third group}} {{overnight}} nature trip to Wisconsin, {{dates back to}} 1974, and the eighth group French immersion trip began in the 1970s with trips to Paris and since the mid-1990s to Quebec. Other lower school traditions, such as <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Fair and class visit to the Coonley Estate, also {{have a long history}} at Avery Coonley. Middle school traditions include the alternating annual Greek and Shakespeare Fests, the sixth group World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to Washington, DC.|$|E

Peppers were first cultivated by <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> in Meso- America.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> of Wapakoneta {{adopted the}} {{agricultural}} methods that the missionaries from the Society of Friends had introduced to them. <b>The</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> worked {{to prove that}} they had indeed adopted the life of the white settlers. Wapakoneta was the location of the first sawmill and gristmill in northwest Ohio. In 1810, the United States sent a government agent to help <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> This did not last since the federal government removed the agent for failing to submit appropriate paperwork.|$|R
5000|$|Concerned that Spain ensure {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> in <b>the</b> newly conquered Americas, the “Reyes Católicos”, Ferdinand and Isabella, {{consulted}} theologians and jurists for religious and legal justification of Spain’s conquests. The treatment of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{was at first}} rationalized {{on the grounds that}} they were cannibals; any means of subjugation were acceptable. However, some of Christopher Columbus’s tactics with <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had resulted in uprisings. In 1500, the king and queen again sought advice; <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were declared to be [...] "free vassals". Despite their elevated status, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> remained subject to conquest in [...] "just wars".|$|R
5|$|The {{availability}} of new cheap land {{led to a}} rapid increase in {{the population of the}} territory, with thousands of new settlers entering the region every year. Large settlements began to spring up {{on the periphery of the}} territory around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, the Wabash River, and the Mississippi River. Much of the interior, though, remained inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> tribes and was left unsettled.|$|E
5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E
5|$|The series proved unpopular in {{everyday}} commerce. Mintage dropped by 90% the following year. From 2002 through 2008, Sacagawea dollars were only struck {{for sale to}} collectors. The Federal Reserve Bank ordered none of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> series after their issuance beginning in 2009. In December 2009, it was noted by a Federal Reserve official that there were currently 857,000,000-dollar coins (including Presidential dollars) in government storage vaults, an amount estimated to satisfy the demand for twelve years.|$|E
50|$|The church's {{history can}} be traced back to the year 1833 at the close of the Blackhawk War, when the treaty with <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> removed most of <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> to <b>the</b> {{reservations}} west of the Mississippi and opened the northern prairies of Illinois for settlement.|$|R
50|$|The {{area known}} as Westmont was {{inhabited}} by the Potawatami until the year 1833. After several failed attempts by the U.S. government to persuade <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{to move from the}} area, in 1833, <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> agreed under coercion to vacate their land for nominal payment.|$|R
40|$|Harrison {{acknowledges}} receiving from Whitall packages containing hardware, tack, {{and farm}} implements. Whitall received the packages from Isaac Craig at Pittsburgh. Whitall, Z. M. It {{is unclear whether}} the packages were annuity payments from <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> to <b>the</b> United States or meant as payment to <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too were killed by <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle {{was the last of}} the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
50|$|The phrase originated, {{according}} to researcher David Wilton, {{in a cultural}} misunderstanding that arose when Europeans first encountered <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> on arriving in North America in the 15th century. Europeans thought they were receiving gifts from <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> believed they were engaged in what was known to Europeans as bartering; this resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> finding European behaviour ungenerous and insulting.|$|R
