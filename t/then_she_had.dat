5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E

El-Said had taken a break from active competition while recovering from an injury of her own and came back shortly before the World Championships. Since <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken the individual all-around title at the 2011 Arab Games and the 2012 African Championships.

25|$|When Hunt Stromberg, {{the last}} {{producer}} she respected, left MGM to produce independently, Loos {{tried to get}} out of her contract as well, but by <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown into too valuable a property to the studio. Throughout the war Loos wrote screenplays, grew vegetables in her Victory garden and knitted socks and sweaters for the boys overseas. MGM let her go before her contract ran out. This time she decided to become a free agent, and even returned to New York to work on a new play. When she returned to California, she had a new partner who had a drinking problem; the relationship would be short-lived.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 January 1799, Grampus was in the Thames and {{under the command of}} Captain John Hall. She weighed at 7a.m., and took a pilot, Sammuel Richardson, on board. Nevertheless, by 9a.m. she had {{grounded}} on the Barking Shelf. She could not be refloated and so for the next three days work went on to remove her stores, her masts, and whatever else could be salvaged. On 21 January {{the decision was made to}} abandon her as by <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> 20 feet of water in her hold. The subsequent court martial absolved Captain Hall and his officers and crew of any responsibility, instead blaming Richardson's ignorance.|$|E

It was during this period that Dmitri began to form a close bond with Nicholas II, looking upon him as a surrogate father. He would join on him on his daily walks and seek {{to spend as much}} time with him as possible. Nicholas, in turn, treated Dmitri very kindly. He seems to have loved the young man's free spirit and sense of humor, a welcome diversion from the stresses of his daily life. Dmitri wrote several letters to his sister during his stay with Nicholas and Alexandra, describing how much he was enjoying himself there.|$|E

500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate <b>then.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything that I could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Verity Lambert {{had first}} made her mark as {{producer of the}} first two years of Doctor Who (1963). Since <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> carved out an impressive career, first at the BBC with programmes such as Adam Adamant Lives! (1966–67) and The Newcomers (1965–69), and then at Thames Television with productions such as The Naked Civil Servant (TV film; 1975) and the series Rumpole of the Bailey (1978–92). She became Chief Executive of Euston Films in 1979; Quatermass was one of the first productions she oversaw in the role, seeing it as a project to make her mark on the company. She had clashed with Nigel Kneale in 1965 on the BBC arts programme Late Night Line-Up, when he attacked her for making Doctor Who too frightening for children. Despite this she held Kneale in high esteem, describing him as [...] "a fantastic writer... hugely imaginative... considering the impact his work has had, I think he's undervalued". Following Quatermass she produced such shows as Danger UXB (1979), Minder (1979–85; 1988–94) and Widows (1983) for Euston before in 1985 forming her own production company, Cinema Verity, which oversaw programmes including G.B.H.

500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since <b>then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Brady {{was born}} in Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Stewart, an {{unmarried}} tea room waitress. The identity of Brady's father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother {{said he was a}} reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper, who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. Various authors have stated that he tortured animals, although Brady objected to such accusations. Aged nine, he visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. He was accepted for Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. At Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and {{took a job as a}} tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a flick knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother. By <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady, and it was the latter who got Brady a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market.|$|E
