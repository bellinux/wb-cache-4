40|$|IP {{telephony}} presents {{some big}} advantages over traditional circuit-switched telephony {{especially in the}} sense of increased utilization of expensive backbones and significantly reduced cost. However, in order to win the competition, IP telephony must provide the same quality of voice service as the traditional telephony, which has been proven as a major challenge. In today’s VoIP market, multiple vendors have developed different IP telephony products based on some well-known IP telephony Standards such as ITU-T H. 323 and IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In Part I of this paper, we present some metrics to help evaluate IP <b>Telephony</b> <b>Performance,</b> discuss a new architecture proposed by Pawan and etc. [1], Distributed Open Signaling Architecture (DOSA), as an enhancement to H. 323 and SIP. Then in Part II, we conduct a simulation experiment to demonstrate the backbone-scheduling requirements for this robust IP telephony architecture. Part I: Critical Paper Review and Summar...|$|E
40|$|This project explores market {{structure}} {{and performance in}} cellular telephony. It contrasts China and other countries regarding the effect of {{market structure}} on mobile <b>telephony</b> <b>performance</b> and evaluates China’s cellular sector performance relative to its declared public policy goals in telecommunications. The results indicate that lower market concentration can increase mobile penetration. The negative relationship of market concentration and price levels {{as well as the}} positive relationship of market concentration and labor productivity can be reasonably explained. This study finds evidence to support China’s efforts to promote mobile telecommunications by encouraging competition. However, the benefits of increased competition are likely smaller compared to other countries. Regarding China’s competition goals in telecommunications, the regulators have made a great effort in encouraging competition in the cellular sector and their efforts are well rewarded. However, they have room to foster an even more competitive market structure in order to reap even greater benefits...|$|E
40|$|CONCLUSION ILAH, LSR and LILAH from [4] {{exceed the}} {{performance}} of the optimized baseline on unencoded speech, and at clipping levels between- 3 and- 14 dBFS on decoded speech, an important range in mobile <b>telephony</b> applications. <b>Performance</b> is maintained at SNRs down to 5 dB. The averaging nature of histogram approach in ILAH, and the spectral approach of LSR both provide robustness to noise. The baseline method with ε = 0. 71 (optimized) in decoded speech generates many FPs, and loses accuracy at high ODF because it does not adapt to each speaker, whilst the F 1 score improves at high ODF because it crudely labels all samples of significant amplitude as clipped...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a model for}} the performance analysis of mobile packet data services sharing a common GSM/GPRS (Global System for Mobile communications/General Packet Radio Service) cellular infrastructure with mobile <b>telephony</b> services. The <b>performance</b> model is developed using the DSPN (Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Net) paradigm. With limited computational cost, the DSPN solution allows the derivation of a number of interesting performance metrics, which can be instrumental for the development of accurate design and planning algorithms for cellular networks offering integrated services. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{telephone}} conferencing {{has been}} accom-plished {{by way of}} a centralized conference bridge. The tandem arrangement of high compression speech codecs in conventional VoIP conference bridges lead to speech distortions and require a substantial number of computations. Decentralized architectures avoid the speech degradations and delay, but lack strong control and depend on silence suppression to make the endpoint band-width and processing requirements scalable. One solution is to use centralized speaker selection and forwarding, and decentralized decoding and mixing. This approach eliminates the problem of tandem encodings but maintains centralized control, thereby improving the speech quality and scalability of the conference. This paper considers design options and solutions for this model in the context of modern IP <b>telephony</b> networks. <b>Performance</b> was evaluated with real conferees over live conferences using a PC-based conferencing test bed, built using a custom software-based bridge and a third-party endpoint. Conferees strongly preferred the speech quality of the new arrangement to that of a conventional VoIP conference bridge. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{technology}} of adaptive antennas is rapidly growing {{during the last}} years. It is true that switched beam antennas, the simplest type of smart antennas, may provide substantial benefits when implemented in a cellular mobile <b>telephony</b> system. The <b>performance</b> of a six-beam switched parasitic planar array, in terms of bit error rate (BER) measurement, is presented in this paper. The switched parasitic planar array is designed {{with the aid of}} genetic algorithms method. The antenna system is evaluated in a radio environment where interfering signals are present. The results obtained from the simulation are compared with respect to the ones when an omni directional antenna is used instead of the switched beam array, revealing that the performance of such a telecommunication system can be improved. 1...|$|R
40|$|The United States NavyÎ±s next {{generation}} ship(s) scheduled for commissioning {{in the year}} 2004 and beyond will integrate tactical shipboard voice communications systems into the local area network (LAN). A single network eliminates separate voice and data infrastructures, consolidates services, and reduces the cost of communications. The existing installation of highspeed shipboard data networks has {{laid the foundation for}} the convergence of these two technologies. Currently, there is no high level definition of how multiple system types will share a common infrastructure. Neither is there a baseline defining acceptable end-to-end standards for the merger of these two systems. Common practice for demonstrating feasibility is confined to using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment in a show-and-tell environment. Although this indicates certain operational features it does not demonstrate if <b>telephony</b> systemÎ±s <b>performance</b> are within specified limits. Neither does this type of demonstration simulate realistic shipboard tactical load performance requirements or what effect this integration will have on data systems that co-habitat the LAN. The purpose of this thesis is to define the convergence of the centralized shipboard tactical voice communication communications system into a distributed software-based system and the minimum set of acceptable software requirements for full integration of this system into the existing shipboard local area network infrastructure. In addition, this thesis will address the quality of service, tactical requirements risk assessment, interoperability, training, integration with legacy systems and other factors involved in the total cost of ownership.

The survey covered thousands of enterprises of all sizes and economic activities, selected to embody a representative sample of the Palestinian business sector. It further explores the views of the owners and managers of these enterprises regarding the use of ICTs. The study reveals that mobile phones have meaningfully enhanced internal processes and the overall value chain. Most notably, mobile phones were effective in bridging the information and connectivity gap businesses in developing countries ordinarily suffer...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications {{reform in}} India {{began in the}} 1980 s, but a {{struggle}} to find reforms that would substantially improve industry performance lasted {{for more than a}} decade. Beginning in the new millennium, technological change and new government policies encouraged competition, primarily from mobile <b>telephony,</b> and <b>performance</b> improved dramatically (figure 1). Not surprisingly, telecommunications access has increased far more quickly for wealthy and urban consumers than for poor and rural consumers. To address this gap, India has adopted so-called universal service policies, especially targeting rural villages. These policies rely primarily on subsidizing the incumbent state-owned carrier, despite its unimpressive historical performance. An innovative part of India’s universal service policy is a series of auctions in which providers bid the subsidy they seek for building village public telephone (VPT) networks and rural household phones. In the first auction, the only bidder and hence the recipient of the subsidy was Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), the incumbent state-owned carrier for nearly all of India. Subsequent auctions drew some private sector participation and helped reduce the subsidy that was provided. Nonetheless, the auction process has generally favored BSNL and is probably not the most effective mechanism for either minimizing the state subsidy or identifying the most efficient provider. Meanwhile, the taxes that finance the access subsidy are highly distortionary. Moreover, private mobile operators are expanding service rapidly, which calls into question the presumption that a subsidy scheme targeted at VPTs is cost-effective. The funds for implementing the universal service policy come from two sources. One is a tax on the revenues of all telecommunications carriers. The other is “access deficit charges ” on subscribers of systems owned by private carriers. These fees are paid directly to BSNL. In theory, these fee...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a study {{conducted}} to investigate {{the nature of the}} relationship between increased access and use of <b>telephony,</b> small business <b>performance</b> and regional development in a developing country context. This study presents detailed evidence drawn from a sample of 198 small businesses in Nigeria. The research conceptualises and empirically tests a research model which incorporates three theories in order to connect and explain how the use of telephony by small businesses enhances business performance and contributes to regional development. This is based on the existing literature of small business development; telecommunications (increased access and use of telephony) by small business; and regional development. The research data was gathered through a questionnaire of owner-managers of small businesses. This data was supplemented by the use of photographs. The data generated was analysed using Logistic Regression techniques with the aid of SPSS V. 17 statistical package. In addition, the study used Visual Data Analysis and Interviews to corroborate the outcomes of the statistical analyses. The regression results suggest that there is a statistically significant and positive relationship between the ‘impact of using telephony in business processes’ and enhanced business performance. In particular, it was identified that ‘the extent of the influence of using telephony in the acquisition of new customers’; ‘the extent of the influence of using telephony to reduce the time it takes to make important business decisions’; and ‘the extent of the influence of using telephony in acquiring better market prices’ are critical determinants that explains enhanced competitive advantage of small businesses. In addition, ‘the extent of the influence of using telephony in the acquisition of new customers’, and ‘the extent of the influence of using telephony to reduce the time it takes to make important business decisions’ are critical determinants that explains enhanced profitability of small businesses. This evidence is corroborated by the analysis of the visual data and textual description of the owner-managers interviewed who noted that the influence of using telephony have enhanced their business performance. Furthermore, the regression results suggest there is a statistically significant and positive relationship between the ‘growth outcomes of increased access and use of telephony by small businesses’ and regional development of the business location. In particular, ‘the extent of influence of use of telephony by small businesses to create new jobs’, ‘the extent of influence of use of telephony by small businesses on improved business performance’, and ‘the extent of influence of use of telephony by small businesses on significant business growth’ are critical determinants that explains regional development of the small business location. Finally, given the important role small businesses play in developing countries, such as Nigeria, this study help provides a clearer explanation on {{the nature of the relationship}} between increased access and use of <b>telephony,</b> small business <b>performance</b> and regional development that could be used to improve the growth of entrepreneurial activities of small businesses which are precursors of economic growth as well as improve infrastructural services such as telecommunications that are essential for regional development...|$|R
