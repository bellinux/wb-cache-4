25|$|The Z8 used neon {{exterior}} lighting, {{the tail}} lights and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs {{and are expected}} to last {{for the life of the}} vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Midyear 2015, Toyota {{released}} a Persona Series in 2 colors, Blizzard White (extra $220) and Absolutely Red. This {{model is a}} Model 3 with upgrades: black faux leather-like seats, black floor mats and side panels, heated side mirrors with <b>turn</b> <b>indicators,</b> lighted footwells, dark metal finish 5 stock 17-inch wheels with 215/45/17 tires.|$|E
50|$|IMO say's that {{a maximum}} allowed {{deviation}} from the real situation shown by the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is 0.5 degrees. The rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to keep this accuracy until a speed of 30 knots is reached.|$|R
50|$|If a ship is {{equipped}} with an AIS system and a rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> then the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> must {{be connected to the}} AIS to send the rate of turn to other vessels. This makes it easier for other vessels to interpret the manoeuvre of the ship.|$|R
50|$|It {{has to be}} {{possible}} to test the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite these changes, the Z8 {{remained}} extremely {{faithful to}} the concept car. The side-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were preserved {{through the use of}} an expensive MIG-welded aluminum space frame. The Z8 even retained the concept's five-spoke wheel design, albeit without the race-style center lug nut.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{vehicles}} (except many motorcycles {{and commercial}} semi-tractors) have a turn-indicator self-cancelling feature that returns the lever to the neutral (no signal) {{position as the}} steering wheel approaches the straight-ahead position after a turn has been made. Beginning in the late 1960s, indicating for a lane change was facilitated {{by the addition of}} a spring-loaded momentary signal-on position just shy of the left and right detents. The signal operates for however long the driver holds the lever partway towards the left or right turn signal detent. Some recent vehicles have an automatic lane-change indication feature; tapping the lever partway towards the left or right signal position and immediately releasing it causes the applicable <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> to flash three to five times.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 Argentina {{offered the}} 1962-64-style Chevy II as the Chevrolet 400 through 1974, and the 1968–72 Nova as the Chevrolet Chevy from late 1969 through 1978, both models {{overlapping}} for several years. [...] An upscale model (Chevy Super) was produced from about 1973 with different trim, front <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> and taillights, {{a much better}} appointed interior with plastic [...] "wood" [...] trim, named Malibu with {{no relation to the}} American Chevelle. All engines were inline-sixes. The first and second generations were available, depending on year and model, with the , [...] and [...] engines.|$|E
40|$|The {{gyroscopic}} instruments {{commonly used}} in instrument flying in the United States are the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> the directional gyro, the gyromagnetic compass, the gyroscopic horizon, and the automatic pilot. These instruments are described. Performance data and the method of testing in the laboratory are given for the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> the directional gyro, and the gyroscopic horizon. Apparatus for driving the instruments is discussed...|$|R
50|$|A rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to {{be fully}} {{operational}} within four minutes after start-up.|$|R
50|$|The International Maritime Organisation has {{developed}} some requirements {{on the development}} of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instruments, {{either the}} turn and slip {{indicator}} or the turn coordinator, have the standard rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft {{are equipped with}} 2-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were {{mounted in}} the upper corners of the rear window.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> {{have been}} {{integrated}} into the headlamp housing and the tail lamp cluster features a segmented stop and brake light section with the <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> built into a single unit that wraps around the brake light’s bottom side. Also LEDs have been used replacing the conventional bulbs. The split hand grips for the pillion rider serves in providing a different look.|$|E
5000|$|Turn Signal Indicators.Not all {{motorcycles}} have <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators,</b> or [...] "blinkers." [...] Off road cycles do not. Prior to the 1970s, most motorcycles, even roadsters, {{were not}} fitted with <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators.</b> All road bikes are now factory fitted with <b>turn</b> signals <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{left hand}} drive (LHD) vehicles, the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> stalks are located on {{the left of the}} {{steering}} column.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006: Larger {{ignition}} coils supply {{a more stable}} spark at lower rpms; clear smoke lenses on the <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> lights.|$|R
50|$|In the Autumn/Fall of 1978 {{the larger}} {{headlights}} and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were also {{applied to the}} remaining Kadett Cs.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Hillman Avenger Saloon: a two-door {{version was}} offered from 1973. The absence of {{wrap-around}} <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> {{on the front}} corners identifies this as a pre-facelift Avenger.|$|E
5000|$|... ~1985: Oval <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> at {{the front}} became two {{rectangular}} lights. The same lamps began to be fitted to the rear ...|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of {{the rate of the}} <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is based on a gyroscope with an availability of turning in just one direction. When the ship is steering a straight course, the gyroscope will point in a straight direction and the pointer will point to the zero on the display. When the vessel makes a turn to port, the gyroscope will turn to port side due to inertia and this will be pointed on the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b> The same can be said for the starboard side.|$|R
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> stalk or <b>turn</b> {{signal lever}} is the control lever which {{operates}} the <b>turn</b> signal or <b>indicator</b> {{lights on the}} front, sides and rear of the vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel {{is about to be}} turned.|$|R
5000|$|Options {{included}} themed special editions {{as well as}} 18-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, racing stripes, [...] "dragon" [...] and [...] "houndstooth" [...] graphics, and LED <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{trailer lights}} {{usually have a}} shared light for brake and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> If such a trailer is to be {{connected}} to a car with separate lamps for turn indicator and brake a Trailer light converter is needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirements}} for the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> are that the zero {{has to be on}} top, the indicator has to go to the left when ship is turning to port side, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The Savvy, {{along with}} other in house {{designed}} Protons such as the Gen-2, Persona, Satria Neo, Waja, Waja Chancellor, and second generation Saga, feature <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> switches placed at the left hand side, unlike models introduced earlier, such as the first generation Saga, Wira and Perdana.|$|R

5000|$|... 1978 brought slight {{cosmetic}} changes: the grille was black; the rear-facing hood vents {{replaced the}} sideways vents; and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were {{mounted in the}} bumper instead of in the grille. The CVCC engine was now rated at 60 hp (45 kW).|$|E
50|$|Externally {{the car is}} {{very similar}} to the 1500 with {{differences}} including: amber or white (depending on market) front <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> shared with white parking lamps, separate stop/tail and turn lamps in the rear, and 1600 badging on the boot and the cowl.|$|E
50|$|The TVS calls {{their design}} {{approach}} for Flame as Deltaedge. This {{is inspired by}} the delta wing of fighter jets and features design cues with a triangular theme, like the arrow shaped headlight. The <b>turn</b> <b>indicators,</b> named Trafficators by TVS is integrated to the fuel tank scoops.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{gyroscopic}} {{instrument that}} {{works on the}} principle of precession. The gyro is mounted in a gimbal. The gyro's rotational axis is in-line with the lateral (pitch) axis of the aircraft, while the gimbal has limited freedom around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the aircraft.|$|R
