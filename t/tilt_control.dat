50|$|CLEVER employs an {{electronically}} {{controlled and}} hydraulically actuated Direct <b>Tilt</b> <b>Control</b> {{system with a}} maximum tilt angle of ±45° 6. A pair of single acting hydraulic actuators generate a tilting moment about the tilt bearing (which joins the cabin and rear module). The tilt controller uses driver’s steer input and the vehicle’s speed to estimate the lateral acceleration and hence the appropriate tilt angle. The DTC system provides excellent stability at low speeds but during vigorous manoeuvres at higher speeds the system’s torque output exceeds that which can be reacted by the non-tilting rear module; {{as a result the}} inside rear wheel lifts, this can lead to the vehicle rolling over.|$|E

5000|$|The CLEVER (for [...] "compact low {{emission}} {{vehicle for}} urban transport") {{is a type of}} tilting three-wheeled motor vehicle that was developed in a collaboration between the University of Bath, BMW {{and a number of other}} partners from across Europe.

The narrow body endows it with some of the manoeuvrability and congestion avoiding capability of a motorcycle, whilst offering comparable weather and impact protection to a car. Carbon emissions are reduced as a function of low weight and a small frontal area. The narrow track width requires that CLEVER tilts into corners to maintain stability; thus it is fitted with a Direct <b>Tilt</b> <b>Control</b> (DTC) system that uses hydraulic actuators linking the cabin to the non-tilting rear engine module.|$|E

50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct <b>Tilt</b> <b>Control</b> (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s tilt angle error (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt angle error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a tilt angle error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt angle error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E
40|$|Narrow tilting {{vehicles}} {{offer an}} opportunity to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, a low weight and a small frontal area. Their narrow track requires that they tilt into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> system. Automated <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> systems can be classed as steering <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> in which active control of the front-wheel steering angle is used to maintain stability, direct <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and non-tilting part(s), or a combination of the two, namely steering–direct <b>tilt</b> <b>control.</b> Combined steering–direct <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> systems have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike steering <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> systems, they are effective at low speeds while offering superior transient roll stability to direct <b>tilt</b> <b>control</b> systems.

40|$|Motorbike riders are 34 -times {{more likely}} to die in a crash {{compared}} to car drivers per km travelled (1). Such safety risks together with special skill requirements for the driver and much lower comfort compared to normal cars are the main reasons why motorbikes represent only a fraction of all vehicle sales in developed countries. Deakin University is developing a revolutionary cross-over fun vehicle with ultra low fuel consumption and emissions. This new vehicle generation combines the best of two worlds: the fun to drive, low cost, and small size of a scooter together with the safety, comfort and easiness to operate of a car. The result is a vehicle that is more fuel efficient than most cars or even scooters. Various tilting cross over vehicles have been presented over the last decade that were trying to automate the <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> of narrow vehicles to make them safer. Examples of these concepts are the Carver, Clever and in some way also the MP 3 scooter from Piaggio. The problem with fully enclosed concepts like the Carver or Clever is that they require very complex and therefore also expensive <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> systems so that the vehicles are not price competitive compared to low cost micro cars or even normal small cars. The MP 3 on the other hand comes with a <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system which is only semi automatic so that typical car advantages - comprehensive safety features like crush zones, roll over protection, air bags, safety belts or comfort features like full weather protection including heating and cooling – can not be provided. Deakin’s approach is quite different to the above mentioned concepts. The requirements were derived based on two different investigations: The first step was a critical evaluation of social trends and the second step was an in-depth benchmarking study of existing concepts which identified the typical strengths and weaknesses of these concepts. In a critical next step a new concept was created that addresses most of the weaknesses of existing tilting three-wheelers in a holistic approach by setting clear priority rankings for the vehicle targets, based on current trends. The priorities were set in the following order: Safety, Affordability, Fun and Efficiency (SAFE). The key feature that enables an enclosed tilting vehicle is a fully automatic <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system. With an automatic <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system the driver does not need to put the feet on the ground to balance the vehicle when he stops, so the vehicle can be built with a full enclosure. This allows the implementation of typical car like safety features (seat belts, roll over structure, crush zones, air bags). The SafeRide™ <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system is a passive system that involves the driver’s balancing sense in its feedback control system. The vehicle has typical scooter like steering characteristics, where the steering is initiated through countersteering. Another safety critical design feature is the crush zone between the two front wheels which is not possible with only one front wheel or with the powertrain positioned between the front wheels, as the powertrain can’t absorb a lot of energy due to its structural stiffness and density. The passive <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system is quite simple and therefore makes the vehicle very affordable, an important factor for successful commercialisation. Another advantage of integrating the human balancing senses in the feedback <b>control</b> of the <b>tilting</b> system is that the system kicks in slightly after the human balancing reacts. In some instances that can generate the typical adrenalin thrill known from riding a bike. This fun factor is quite common with many trend sports like mountain biking, surfing, roller-skating, snowboarding, or skateboarding. Some of these sports have seen very rapid growth only a short time after they have been invented. Utilising the human balancing system during driving also makes the vehicle safer as the adrenalin is produced after reaching a semi-stable driving condition that is controlled by the vehicles <b>tilting</b> <b>control</b> system, but before the vehicle reaches an unstable driving condition that can not be controlled by the vehicle but only (eventually) by the driver – if he has got the required driving skill and if he is alert enough. Efficiency superior to most cars and scooters is achieved by the aerodynamics of a fully enclosed body structure in combination with the small frontal area of a typical scooter and the droplet shape enabled by the relatively wide front with 2 wheels and the very narrow tail with only one rear wheel. The passive tilting system also contributes to the extreme efficiency as the system only draws some small electrical power for the electronic control unit. Another feature is a low cost exhaust energy recovery system which is discussed in another paper. <br /...|$|R
