5|$|In 1863, {{with the}} {{cemetery}} fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic, the LSWR agreed {{to build a}} mainline station at Brookwood, along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard, provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster's house for the new station. The new station, called Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station (the suffix was gradually dropped), opened on 1 June 1864. A substantial commuter village grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station, and the station building (on the northern side of the tracks) was enlarged in 1890. In conjunction with these works, a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Rifle</b> Association's shooting range at Bisley, running west {{to the north of}} the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley.|$|E
5|$|On the {{authority}} of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January–May 1948. Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial, and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge. (Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom, whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet. They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948, but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E, a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War.) The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge. As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use, temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Rifle</b> Association's shooting range at Bisley, {{on the opposite side of}} the LSWR line from the cemetery. Following the removal of the US war graves the site in which they had been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war.|$|E
