5|$|Heikkinen's {{interception}} of {{a forward}} pass proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> break in a 70 win over Penn. He also blocked kicks for points after touchdown in one-point wins over Illinois (76) and Chicago (1312). Without Heikkinen’s big plays against Penn, Illinois and Chicago, the Wolverines {{likely would have}} been 152 instead of 44. Even in a 210 loss to Ohio State, Heikkinen blocked two kicks.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick {{had led the}} Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards {{in the final two}} games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E

In one arc, Gladwell cites various seeming afflictions that may in fact have significantly contributed to success, linking dyslexia with the high-flying career of lawyer David Boies, and the loss of a parent at an early age with the exceptional research work of oncologist Emil J.

25|$|The Belgian command was {{counting}} on Eben-Emael <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> defense of the northern frontier at Liège. It naturally attracted the first German attacks. Its enormous dimensions dictated an unconventional attack strategy, using airborne troops. The fort was attacked on 10 May 1940 and rendered ineffective {{in a few hours}} by a team of 75 men armed with new shaped-charge explosives. Ineffective Belgian defense of the fort's surface allowed the German assault team to use their explosive charges to destroy or render the fort's gun turrets and machine gun cloches uninhabitable.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} third quarter, Allen lost a fumble {{that led to}} Franklin's field goal, tying the game back up at 20.

There was still a full quarter left to play, but the Raiders would get no further in the game than the New England 41-yard line. Los Angeles' three fourth quarter drives would result in a punt, an interception by Fred Marion and a turnover on downs at their own 13.|$|E
25|$|A key path is a {{specific}} file, registry key, or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a file {{is the most common}} type of key path, the term key file is commonly used. A component can contain at most one key path; if a component has no explicit key path, the component's destination folder is taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> path. When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is a mismatch between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a key file is missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as self-healing or self-repair. No two components should use the same key path.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was {{directly related to}} the availability of silicic acid — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell energy budget. Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH buffering agent, facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, before {{enzymology}} was well understood, colloids were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{to the operation}} of enzymes; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter {{the properties of the}} water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific substrate, such as a solution of ATPase breaking down ATP. Furthermore, life itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an organism. As more detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the macromolecular theory, which explains enzymes as a collection of identical huge molecules that act as very tiny machines, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a factory full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple osmotic changes that would be caused by the presence of any solute. In humans, both the thyroid gland and the intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) of the pituitary gland contain colloid follicles.|$|E

40|$|A {{core-shell}} fibrous silica mesoporous ZSM- 5 (FmZSM- 5) {{has been}} developed by employing microemulsion system coupled with zeolite crystal-seed crystallization method and unprecedented applied in CO methanation. The FmZSM- 5 showed greatly enhanced catalytic activity with the rate of CO conversion (0. 0708 μmol-CO/m 2 s) {{and the rate of}} CH 4 formation (0. 0488 μmol-CH 4 /m 2 s) at 723 K, which is two-fold higher than that of the conventional recrystallized mZSM- 5 (RmZSM- 5). Besides, it showed high stability with no sign of deactivation up to 50 h. The presence of oxygen vacancies led to the increase in interparticle porosity, basicity, and CO and H 2 adsorption sites which <b>are</b> believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> for remarkably improved in CO methanation.
