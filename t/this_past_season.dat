25|$|Lyon {{played a}} total of six {{friendly}} matches. Lyon opened up their pre-season on 12 July with a 3–2 victory over Nîmes in Albertville, near Tignes, the location of Lyon's pre-season camp. A week later, on 19 July, they traveled away to Bucharest to face Rapid București, which resulted in a 2–1 loss. They then took a trip to Belgrade to play against Partizan on 23 July. Lyon came out with a positive result, beating the Serbian side 3–1 with goals from Karim Benzema and Sidney Govou. They followed that victory up with another as they cruised to a 3–0 victory over Ligue 1 side Nancy in nearby Villefranche-sur-Saône. Their last friendly in the month of July would in turn be a 0–1 defeat to AS Monaco on July 29 in Annecy. Their final friendly match was the annual Trophée des Champions match. Since Lyon won both the league and the Coupe de France, they faced the club that finished in second place in Ligue 1 <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>season,</b> Bordeaux. The match was played on 2 August at Bordeaux's ground, the Stade Chaban-Delmas. After 90 minutes without a goal, Bordeaux defeated Lyon 5–4 on penalties to earn their first Trophée des Champions title, ending Lyon's streak of six-straight Trophée des Champions titles.|$|E

40|$|This season, Iowa soybean {{producers}} have been challenged by several disease problems and some problems may revisit {{in the next}} soybean crop if proper management is not applied.

40|$|Recent {{trials have}} shown that reduced rates of {{insecticide}} combined with salt have given effective control of mirids — with reduced negative affects on beneficials. Green and brown mirids have become important mid to late season sucking pests in cotton — particularly Ingard cotton —causing considerable damage (see The Australian Cottongrower July–August 2001, p. 6). This is mainly due to the marked reduction {{in the use of}} non-selective Helicoverpa insecticides which previously also coincidentally controlled mirids. Further reduction in the use of broad-spectrum insecticides is expected with two-gene cotton (Bollgard II), increasing the chance that mirids will be more of a problem. Over <b>this</b> <b>past</b> cotton <b>season,</b> two or three insecticide sprays were required to manage mirids in some valleys, including the South Burnett. Most of the registered mirid chemicals are non-selective and are highly disruptive {{to a wide range of}} beneficial species. Use of these disruptive chemicals will minimise the potential value of IPM approaches. Low rates of existing chemicals have been used to reduce their disruptive effect, but they do not always control the pests. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, 38 {{participants}} representing 33 {{farms in}} 6 counties in New York State participated in on-farm soybean Tactical Agriculture (TAg) team Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs.

Multiple educational meetings were held in farmer fields enhancing opportunities to reinforce use of IPM concepts and techniques. Participating producers benefited from the timely collection of data from their fields throughout the growing season. The pest information gathered from scouting these soybean fields during the growing season was used in other extension educational efforts across New York State. Many growers were encouraged to spray fungicides by commercial field sales people without the presence of disease as a way to increase yield. From past research conducted by the NYS IPM program and a few TAg producers found this not to be the case. Each grower was able to save money from not spraying their soybean fields. Soybean aphids were also found at very low levels with scouting activities on the farms.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. ERTS- 1 imagery {{used in conjunction}} with the surface-drift cards indicated a southerly flow direction of the central California near surface coastal currents during mid-June 1973. The near-surface currents off northern California and southern Oregon were more complex. Some drift cards were recovered north and some south of their release points; however, the prevalent direction of flow was northerly. General agreement in flow direction of coastal currents obtained from ERTS- 1 imagery and drift card data reinforces the image interpretation. Complete seasonal coverage of nearshore circulation interpreted from ERTS- 1 imagery will provide information necessary for proper coastal zone management. Extent of snow cover can be readily delimited on ERTS- 1 band 5. In the central Sierra Nevada Mountains <b>this</b> <b>past</b> winter <b>season,</b> the snow line, as recorded by ERTS- 1, reached an elevation of less than 1500 meters in January but had melted back to between 2500 and 3000 meters by the end of May.
