50|$|Each local {{exchange}} incorporated {{up to eight}} groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The translated digits {{were sent to the}} code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the <b>terminating</b> <b>exchange</b> (two group selectors and a final selector). Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the <b>terminating</b> <b>exchange</b> for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|E

50|$|To make a call, the subscriber's uni{{selector}} seizes a free 1st code selector, {{which in}} turn seizes an A-digit selector via an A-digit hunter uniselector. The A-digit selector returns dial tone, steps to the first dialled digit and searches for a free director from that group. The director includes a two-motion selector - the BC switch - which steps vertically and then horizontally according to the two BC digits. This selector has 6 banks to permit up to 6 pulse trains to be generated by the director to step the code selectors; the bank contacts are strapped via a translation field to indicate the digit required (or to a DCO lead to indicate that all translation digits have been sent). The pulse train output begins after the C-digit is received from the subscriber's telephone. This is generated {{under the control of}} the send switch uniselector as it searches for the marks provided by the translation field straps for the exchange code received. Meanwhile, the subscriber has continued to dial and the four digits of the numerical portion of the number are stored on four more uniselectors. These set up four more marks, and after completing the output of the code translation the send switch uniselector searches for them in turn in order to forward the numerical digits unchanged to step the numerical selectors at the <b>terminating</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{knowledge-based}} economies {{production processes}} require joint effort {{by a number}} of individuals with very specific know-how and organizations play a role as integrator of a variety of individual knowledge. As knowledge specialization increases, however, the integration becomes a difficult endeavor. Escalating specialization and reliance on creativity of individual specialists may weaken the effectiveness of authority-based hierarchical mechanisms, this paper suggests that in order to design knowledge-based production processes, organizations need to design the flow, focusing on how reciprocal exchange emerges in networks of co-workers. We use a computer agent-based model â COOPNET â as a theoretical laboratory to explore the emergence of cooperation in an intra-organizational exchange network. In this virtual environment, we address how individual rewiring and reciprocation strategies interplay with the features of the organization context. More precisely, we test a number of hypotheses on how the freedom assigned to unilaterally <b>terminate</b> an <b>exchange</b> relationships interact with rewarding policies and organization topology and reinforces emerging aggregate cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Recent dogma {{suggested}} that marine mammals {{are not at}} risk of decompression sickness (DCS) due {{to a number of}} evolutionary adaptations. Several proposed adaptations exist. Lung compression and alveolar collapse that <b>terminate</b> gas <b>exchange</b> before a depth is reached where supersaturation is significant and bradycardia with peripheral vasoconstriction affecting the distribution, and dynamics of blood and tissue nitrogen levels. Published accounts of gas and fat emboli and dysbaric osteonecrosis in marine mammals and theoretical modeling have challenged this view-point, suggesting that decompression-like symptoms may occur under certain circumstances, contrary to common belief. Diagnostic imaging modalities are invaluable tools for the non-invasive examination of animals for evidence of gas and have been used to demonstrate the presence of incidental decompression-related renal gas accumulations in some stranded cetaceans. Diagnostic imaging has also contributed to the recognition of clinically significant gas accumulations in live and dead cetaceans and pinnipeds. Understanding the appropriate application and limitations of the available imaging modalities is important for accurate interpretation of results. The presence of gas may be incidental and must be interpreted cautiously alongside all other available data including clinical examination, clinical laboratory testing, gas analysis, necropsy examination and histology results...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the Peopleâs Republic of Chinaâs intervention in the Korean War, the United States <b>terminated</b> education <b>exchange</b> programs and detained scientifically and technically trained Chinese students and intellectuals living in America. This response was partly an exigency of the war but was also reflective of the broader Sino-American Cold War. Utilizing archival material from the Truman and Eisenhower Presidential Archives, as well as published government documents, this paper traces the shifting patterns of American thought regarding education exchange and the utility of Chinese intellectuals and argues that the American government politicized Chinese students {{as early as the}} remission of the Boxer Indemnity Fund in 1905 but came to actively utilize them during the Cold War in an attempt to wage an intellectual war against the PRC. By retaining Chinese students, the United States hoped to deny China advanced scientific and technical information. It also finds that the pressures of constraining a large cohort of stateless individuals, whose technically illegal residence in the United States placed considerable administrative and financial burdens on the American government, led, in part, to enactment of immigration reforms during the early to mid- 1950 s...|$|R
5000|$|The {{worldwide}} decline after 1929 affected France a {{bit later}} than other countries, hitting around 1931. [...] The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.But the depression also lasted longer in France than in most other countries. Like many other countries, France had introduced the gold standard in the nineteenth century, meaning that it was generally possible to exchange bank notes for gold. Unlike other countries (e.g. Great Britain, which abandoned the gold standard in 1931), France stuck to the gold standard until 1936, which caused {{a number of problems}} in times of recession and deflation. France lost competitiveness relative to Great Britain, because the latter was able to offer its products at a cheaper price due to the devaluation of its currency after leaving the gold standard. Furthermore, <b>terminating</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> rate regimes opened up opportunities for expansive monetary policy and thus influenced consumersâ expectations of future inflation, which was crucial for domestic demand. The French economy only started to recover when France abandoned the gold standard.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study key {{exchange}} protocols {{in a model}} where the key exchange takes place between devices with limited displays that can be compared by a human user. If the devices display the same value then the human user {{is convinced that the}} key <b>exchange</b> <b>terminated</b> successfully and securely, and if they do not then the user knows that it came under attack. The main result of this paper is a rigorous proof that the numeric comparison mode for device pairing in Bluetooth version 2. 1 is secure, under appropriate assumptions regarding the cryptographic functions used. Our proof is in the standard model and in particular does not model any of the functions as random oracles. In order to prove our main result, we present formal definitions for key exchange in this model and show our definition to be equivalent to a simpler definition. This is a useful result of independent interest that facilitates an easier security analysis of protocols in this model. ...|$|R

40|$|This project {{considers}} discourse segments {{referred to}} as expressions of disapproval (D). D {{is used as a}} global description for an activity of evaluation in which individuals respond to feeling that is motivated by unmet expectations. Two types of D are considered in this research [...] direct D and indirect D: With direct D, addressee and referent are one-and-the same individual in relationship to a speaker I while with indirect D, they are not. ^ The goal of the research was to describe some of the features of D and the larger discourse units of which they are part (Dexs) and {{to determine the extent to}} which the attributes of participants, their social relationship, the setting, and the audience affect the ways they evolve in spontaneous speech so that underlying social values could be inferred. ^ The analysis revealed that direct D could be initiated in a variety of forms from precoded to spontaneous but that its regularity was in the type of move that most frequently <b>terminated</b> the <b>exchange</b> (acceptance/remediation). Conversely, a much greater variety in response types for initiating indirect D was noted and attributed to the more direct quality of its initiating moves. In general, it was suggested that message directness [...] assessed through syntax, lexico-semantic features, suprasegmental features, and the relationship of semantic output to addressee response [...] was significantly more characteristic of indirect D, where addressee and referent were distinct. It was revealed that both types of D were most frequently issued in contexts where interlocutors were intimates who were approximately equal in social status and age. Direct D occurred less frequently but no less appropriately in service encounters where interlocutors shared neither intimacy not status. It was through indirect D that interlocutors responded most frequently to unmet expectations concerning nonintimate referents in social contexts other than service encounters. ^ By illuminating expectations through the sharing of knowledge, interlocutors participating in D (re) establish behavioral rules for one another. The degree of directness with which those rules are communicated depends largely on the relationship between the interlocutors and their relative social status. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInteraction {{of small}} unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), {{composed}} of negative diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin, CL 2 â) and neutral dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), with poly(N-ethyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide) (PEVP) was studied in water solution {{above and below}} the vesicular membrane melting point by means of differential scanning calorimetry, photon correlation spectroscopy, microelectrophoresis, conductometry, and fluorescence techniques. It has been found that CL 2 â species are homogeneously distributed within DPPC-CL 2 â SUV membrane leaflets and between them. Interaction of PEVP with DPPC-CL 2 â SUVs led to drastic structural rearrangements in the membrane if it was in the fluid state (liquid SUVs). Negative CL 2 â molecules migrated from the inner to the outer membrane leaflet and segregated in the vicinity of adsorbed PEVP chains. In addition, PEVP adsorption <b>terminated</b> completely the <b>exchange</b> of lipid molecules between the SUVs. At the same time, the integrity of liquid SUVs contacting PEVP remained unchanged. Since the interaction of PEVP with liquid SUVs was predominantly electrostatic in nature, the polycation could be completely removed from the vesicular membrane by addition of an excess of polyacrylic acid (PAA) polyanions forming a more stable electrostatic complex with PEVP. Removal of PEVP resulted in complete resumption of the original distribution of lipids in lateral and transmembrane directions as well as intervesicular lipid exchange. In contrast, PEVP interacting with DPPC-CL 2 â SUVs formed defects in the vesicular membrane if it was in the gel state (solid SUVs). Such interaction was contributed not only by electrostatic but most likely by hydrophobic interactions involving the defected membrane sites. PEVP kept contacting solid SUVs in the presence of an abundant amount of PAA. The established phenomena may be important for understanding the biological effects of polycations...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{modeling}} of X-ray and neutron Bragg and total diffraction {{data show that}} the compounds {{referred to in the}} literature as âPd(CN) 2 âandâPt(CN) 2 â are nanocrystalline materials containing of small sheets of vertex-sharing square-planar M(CN) 4 units, layered in a disordered manner with an intersheet separation of 3. 44 A at 300 K. The small size of the crystallites means that the sheetsâ edges form a significant fraction of each material. The Pd(CN) 2 nanocrystallites studied using total neutron diffraction are terminated by water and the Pt(CN) 2 nanocrystallites by ammonia, in place of half of the terminal cyanide groups, thus maintaining charge neutrality. The neutron samples contain sheets of approximate dimensions 30 A x 30 A. For sheets of the size we describe, our structural models predict compositions of Pd(CN) 2 -xH 2 O and Pt(CN) 2 -yNH 3 (x = y = 0. 29). These values are in good agreement with those obtained from total neutron diffraction and thermal analysis, and are also supported by infrared and Raman spectroscopy measurements. It is also possible to prepare related compounds Pd(CN) 2 -pNH 3 and Pt(CN) 2 -qH 2 O, in which the <b>terminating</b> groups are <b>exchanged.</b> Additional samples showing sheet sizes in the range 10 A x 10 A (y = 0. 67) to 80 A x 80 A (p = q = 0. 12), as determined by X-ray diffraction, have been prepared. The related mixed-metal phase, Pd 1 / 2 Pt 1 / 2 (CN) 2 -qH 2 O(q = 0. 50), is also nanocrystalline (sheet size 15 A x 15 A). In all cases, the interiors of the sheets are isostructural with those found in Ni(CN) 2. Removal of the final traces of water or ammonia by heating results in decomposition of the compounds to Pd and Pt metal, {{or in the case of}} the mixed-metal cyanide, the alloy, Pd 1 / 2 Pt 1 / 2, making it impossible to prepare the simple cyanides, Pd(CN) 2, Pt(CN) 2 or Pd 1 / 2 Pt 1 / 2 (CN) 2, by this method. ...|$|R
