5|$|Model's {{first order}} was that Falaise be defended, {{which did not}} impress his staff.

When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, but only if given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions—an act that has been described as naïveté by some, and canny bargaining by others.
