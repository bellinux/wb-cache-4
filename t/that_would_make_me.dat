500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E
500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

But the thing <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> happiest just now would be to know that I could get roaring drunk and wander about the loop for two days without anyone paying any {{attention}} to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, marry! No; <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> <b>me</b> unhappy. It <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> very happy, Patty, to see {{you married}} to a man you would love--very, very happy; though my days would be desolate without you." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{test tube}} panel: In this panel many doctors, {{several of them}} {{publicly}} known, are probing a human subject inside a test tube. Kurelek believed that science could provide a cure-all for all troubles, {{but at the same}} time found the doctors' constant watch over him to be sometimes unpleasant. He believed they were mostly Freudians and would trace most of his problems to sexual maladjustments, so he depicts his discomfort as nakedness in this panel. Above the half-naked subject in the test tube is a snake, functioning as a catalyst to reveal more about the subject. Kurelek writes, [...] "In this case the doctor might introduce some extremely unpleasant idea at the conference <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> squirm with embarrassment.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ichiro {{joined his}} high school {{baseball}} team, his father told the coach, [...] "No matter how good Ichiro is, don't ever praise him. We have to make him spiritually strong." [...] When {{he was ready to}} enter high school, Ichiro was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya's Aikodai Meiden (...) High School. Ichiro was primarily used as a pitcher instead of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative high school batting average was [...]505, with 19 home runs. He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame. Despite his outstanding numbers in high school, Ichiro was not drafted until the fourth and final round of the professional draft in November 1991, because many teams were discouraged by his small size of [...] and [...] Years later, Ichiro told an interviewer, [...] "I'm not a big guy and hopefully kids could look at me and see that I'm not muscular and not physically imposing, that I'm just a regular guy. So if somebody with a regular body can get into the record books, kids can look at that. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> happy." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{slipped away}} at this point, {{suddenly}} remembering {{that it was}} time to take a dose of magic seed. I had bought it from Billy Robinson three days before in school. Billy had assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> grow fast.|$|R
60|$|Bel. to Theo. Then, madam, I must claim your promise, (since I have {{discovered}} {{to you that}} Don Melchor is unworthy of your favours) <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> happy, who, amongst my many imperfections, can never be guilty of such a falsehood.|$|R

6000|$|Great God, I had {{rather be}} [...] A Pagan suckled in some creed outworn; [...] So might I, {{standing}} on this pleasant lea, [...] Have glimpses <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> less forlorn.[114] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> weep, {{if there}} were any tears bitter enough for it," [...] {{answered}} she. [...] "But let it pass! It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, {{that it is}} {{only your}} wanting me very much, and being hardly able to keep alive without me, {{whatever}} my offences, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> feel I ought to say I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MR. BARTRAM--You {{only did}} me justice in supposing <b>that</b> your letter <b>would</b> {{distress}} me. If you had supposed <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> excessively angry as well, {{you would not}} have been far wrong. I have no patience with the pride and perversity of the young women of the present day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was indeed, Annie. I {{think the}} only thing I could do well was fighting. I was a beggar to fight--not because I used to quarrel with fellows, but because it made me hard and tough, and my mother thought <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> more fit {{to carry out this}} search for my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> detestable!" [...] he cried, bitterly. [...] "I {{had to tell}} you, {{to explain}} what I did. I couldn't help doing it. But now if you can forget it, and never think of me again, I can go away, and try to atone for it somehow. I shall be guided." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} so strange to Gwendolen {{in this moment}} that she was quite shaken out of her usual self-consciousness. Blushing and turning away her eyes, she said, [...] "No, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} like that sort of life," [...] said Lillo. [...] "I should like to be {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> a great man, and very happy besides-- something that would not hinder me from having {{a good deal of}} pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The kind <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> {{painful to}} you. Or rather not me perhaps," [...] she added {{as if to}} create between them the fullest {{possible}} light; [...] "but my situation, my exposure--all the results of them I show. Doesn't one {{become a sort of}} a little drain-pipe with everything flowing through?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I {{would not}} like that," [...] she wrote quickly, with a distressed look on her face. [...] "Nobody ever calls <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> feel as if I were not myself but {{somebody}} else. And you do not seem like a stranger to me.

But he wouldn't show off against you. <b>That</b> alone <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> certain <b>that</b> he guesses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, my dear; {{do not say}} <b>that.</b> <b>Would</b> it <b>make</b> <b>me</b> happy <b>that</b> {{you should}} be a {{prisoner}} here for ever? It was only when I seemed to get so weak that I thought about it. I felt {{that it must be}} near when they bade me not to go to the cathedral any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Starbottle {{winced at}} the last sentence. [...] "But," [...] she said eagerly, {{grasping}} Jack's hand, [...] "when you found me sick and helpless at Sacramento, when you--God bless you for it, Jack!--offered to help me to the East, you said you knew of something, you had some plan, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> and Carry independent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow. [...] "But if I carried weapons I might injure someone--perhaps seriously--and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> unhappy. I will just borrow that riding-whip, which I {{see in the}} corner of your hut, if you don't mind. It isn't exactly proper to walk with a riding-whip, but I trust you will excuse the inconsistency." ...|$|E
6000|$|In Easter-week the barons met at Stamford, with 2,000 knights {{and their}} squires.

60|$|Well, he {{acknowledged}} all, and was might humble indeed; he made proposals very handsome; {{he came up}} to #100 and to pay all the law charges, and added <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> a present of a very good suit of clothes. I came down to #300, and I demanded that I should publish an advertisement of the particulars in the common newspapers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, she {{was bent}} upon it. It was {{something}} about you. Oh! she wants {{to take you to}} stay with her in that horrible hole of hers in the City--very odd of her.

6000|$|... "Shank!" [...] exclaimed May, {{letting go}} her brother's arm and facing him with {{flashing}} eyes and heightened colour, [...] "do {{you really think}} <b>that</b> a fortune <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> marry a man whom I did not love?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suppose you don't,' said John. 'Why {{should you}} not become an {{excellent}} housewife? Indeed, I think you will' he proceeded, as she fixed {{her eyes on}} him. 'You see the principle in its right light. This very anxiety is the best pledge.

6000|$|... 'There's {{only one}} thing <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> wish it. I'm quite sure that that Miss Ida knows more about it than she owns.

As to sailing a ship, or stowing her, or {{taking care of her}} in heavy weather, or finding my way across an ocean, I'll turn my back on no man; but it's a different thing when it comes to figures and calculations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not very}} strong on foreigners," [...] he declared. [...] "An American {{is good enough}} for me. And there's {{something}} about <b>that</b> fellow which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> a little slow in trusting him with a woman I cared for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, well,” {{cried the}} youth impatiently, “say no more about it, my good friends; if I am not all <b>that</b> your {{partiality}} <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me,</b> I am yours through life, in prosperity as in poverty. We will talk of other matters.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{give myself}} up," [...] he said.
