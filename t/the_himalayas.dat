50|$|According to George Talbot (Fauna of British India) {{the race}} anomala {{is found in}} <b>the</b> western <b>Himalayas</b> while <b>the</b> {{nominate}} form is from <b>the</b> eastern <b>Himalayas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Eastern <b>Himalayas</b> are watered by the Bay of Bengal monsoon so are wetter than in {{the west}} and have a higher treeline (4,500m {{compared}} to 3,000m in <b>the</b> western <b>Himalayas).</b>|$|R

5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|P. d. indicus Jardine and Selby, 1831, {{described}} from Bangalore, {{is found}} in the Indian subcontinent south of <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas,</b> in Sri Lanka, western Southeast Asia, eastern Iran, south-western Arabia and southern Israel.|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. <b>The</b> <b>Himalayas</b> prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|The Kwik-E-Mart is a {{convenience}} store that sells the usual fare at extraordinarily high prices, including the always popular Squishee. The Kwik-E-Mart chain was started somewhere in <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will perch {{on the backs of}} wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make up most of the chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas,</b> they form large flocks in winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} found from <b>the</b> western <b>Himalayas</b> to <b>the</b> eastern <b>Himalayas</b> and extends into Southeast Asia. It has been {{recorded}} from India, Nepal, China, Indonesia, Laos, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Some populations may be non-migratory.|$|R
50|$|Found from <b>the</b> eastern <b>Himalayas</b> to Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Mariaba convoluta is a moth in {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found on Borneo, Lombok, Sulawesi and in Burma and <b>the</b> {{north-eastern}} <b>Himalayas.</b> <b>The</b> habitat consists of lowland alluvial and hill dipterocarp forests.|$|R

5|$|The russet sparrow {{is found}} in parts of eastern Asia and in <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas.</b> It is not known whether its {{distribution}} is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan. Here, the russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.|$|E

50|$|The smoky warbler (Phylloscopus fuligiventer) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Phylloscopidae. It is found in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Himalayas,</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan Plateau, and as an {{occasional}} vagrant to Myanmar.|$|R
50|$|Brunia sarawaca is a moth of {{the family}} Erebidae. It was {{described}} by Butler in 1877. It is found on Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, Java and <b>the</b> north-eastern <b>Himalayas.</b> <b>The</b> habitat consists of lowland forests.|$|R

5|$|Though ideologically {{the temples}} are {{divided between the}} sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which lie {{in the foothills of}} <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas.</b> The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to {{differentiate}} the original Char Dhams. As the number of pilgrims to these places has increased in modern times, it is called Himalayan Char Dham.|$|E
5|$|A. n. melaschistos was {{described}} by Allan Octavian Hume in 1869. It breeds in mountains from Afghanistan through <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> and southern Tibet to western China, and winters in the plains of South Asia. Larger and longer tailed than nisosimilis, it has dark slate-coloured upperparts, and more distinct rufous barring on the underparts.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{practices}} were noted during the Periods I and II and crops grown were inferred as wheat, barley and lentil; finding lentils established a link of the Neolithic people with Central Asia, crossing over <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chyur tree in {{the high}} {{altitude}}s of <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> growing at an altitude between 500 and 1000m, known as the Indian butter tree (Diploknema butyracea), is called a Kalpavriskha, or tree of paradise {{by the people of}} the mountainous region as it yields honey, jaggery and ghee. It is in the shape of an umbrella.|$|E
5|$|However some {{research}} shows that black carbon will increase global warming, being second only to CO2. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other areas such as <b>the</b> <b>Himalayas</b> where glacial melting occurs. It can also darken Arctic ice reducing reflectivity and increasing absorption of solar radiation.|$|E
