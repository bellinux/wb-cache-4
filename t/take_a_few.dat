5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months to over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived {{for as much as}} four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks to become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency {{may be able to}} be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours, and digestion within the cells may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E

5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E

25|$|Amiodarone is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats.

25|$|Starting in 1576, Boy led the {{construction}} of the palace that preceded the extant Baroque version of the Drottningholm Palace.

25|$|Cavity spawners: {{lay eggs}} in a cave or cavity. These fish form pairs and have {{advanced}} brood care where the eggs are defended and cleaned. The eggs <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days to hatch, and the fry are often guarded by the parents. Various catfish, Cyprinidae, and killifish make up the majority. Cavity spawners can be contrasted with open (shelter) spawners, which lay their eggs on an open surface.|$|E

25|$|Hughes v. Fairchild: Hughes Aircraft sued Fairchild {{arguing that}} their {{researchers}} developed the Hoerni's process earlier. According to Fairchild lawyers, {{this case was}} baseless, but could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, during which Fairchild could not sell the license to Hoerni's process. Therefore, Fairchild chose to settle with Hughes out of court. Hughes acquired the rights {{to one of the}} seventeen points of the Hoerni's patent, and then exchanged it for {{a small percentage of the}} future licensing incomes of Fairchild.|$|E
25|$|Botanically, {{the fruit}} {{produced}} is a berry. The berries develop {{later in the}} season; berry development time varies from species to species from {{a few weeks to}} a year, although most philodendrons <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months. The spathe will enlarge to hold the maturing berries. Once the fruit are mature, the spathe will begin to open again, but this time it will break off at the base and fall to the forest floor. Additionally, the berries are edible, although they contain calcium oxalate crystals, and have a taste akin to bananas.|$|E
25|$|The mooted Flanders Offensive {{was then}} {{cancelled}} altogether after further lobbying of Kitchener by Joffre and Millerand, who visited England especially {{to demand that}} the BEF instead take over more French line. Sir John agreed (15 January), {{as soon as he}} was reinforced, to relieve two French corps north of Ypres to allow Joffre to build up French reserves for his own offensive. Murray was sent off sick for a month (24 January) and French demanded his resignation, despite Murray insisting that he only needed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off. Robertson replaced him.|$|E

It is found that when communities request help building a well, these communities are more successful in maintaining their water supply than communities that are approached and just given a well.|$|R
25|$|Fujinami quickly gained {{popularity}} {{and was the}} leading vote getter amongst Central League starting pitchers for the 2013 NPB All-Star Series, with more than 96,000 votes. Fujinami started the second game of the All-Star series and pitched two scoreless innings. In {{the top of the}} sixth inning, he played a prank on Nippon Ham's Sho Nakata, a former senior at Osaka Tōin, by throwing 2 very slow balls over his head, which prompted Nakata to throw his bat and jokingly <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> steps toward the mound. Fujinami ended up striking out Nakata.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia infection, often simply {{known as}} chlamydia, is a sexually {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles. The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{was sent}} off sick {{for a month}} (24 January 1915) and French demanded his {{resignation}} (25 January 1915), despite Murray insisting that he only needed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off. Wilson was widely suspected of having plotted for Murray's removal in the vain hope of replacing him, but the job went to Robertson. Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long. Haig wrote (diary 26 January) that “Murray was a kindly fellow but not a practical man in the field”.|$|E
