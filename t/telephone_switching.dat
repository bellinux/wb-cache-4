The electricity was fed from the Hydro-Electric scheme and was connected to twelve buildings, in Whitemore and several nearby farms, by August of the same year. There may have been blacksmiths in Whitemore from the mid-19th century. A blacksmith established a shop on the main road in 1895 that was, by 1900, the only blacksmith in the area. Shaw Contracting's office is on the site of this former blacksmith's shop.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} telephone switchboard {{was introduced in}} 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic.

25|$|When {{new forms}} of {{communication}} came into existence in the 19th and early 20th centuries the GPO claimed monopoly rights {{on the basis that}} like the postal service they involved delivery from a sender and to a receiver. The theory was used to expand state control of the mail service into every form of electronic communication possible on the basis that every sender used some form of distribution service. These distribution services were considered in law as forms of electronic post offices. This applied to telegraph and <b>telephone</b> <b>switching</b> stations.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Jamaica Plain had a {{significant}} immigrant population, which helped shape {{the future of the}} community. Many Irish had settled in large numbers in the Heath Street, South Street, Forest Hills and Stony Brook area (Brookside), taking laboring and domestic jobs, and becoming one-quarter of the population. Germans had reached 14%, living in Hyde Square, Egleston Square and Brookside, employed as skilled workers and managers, with their own social clubs and churches. Canadians, many from the Maritime Provinces, made up 12% of the population, often working in white collar or skilled jobs. Italians would come as well, in the years after 1910. New technologies allowed local businesses to provide jobs into the new century. In the 1910s, Randall-Faichney Company manufactured automobile parts, and the Holtzer-Cabot Company moved from making electric motors and <b>telephone</b> <b>switching</b> equipment to add electric automobiles.|$|E

2500|$|Westinghouse's {{interests}} in gas distribution and <b>telephone</b> <b>switching</b> [...] {{led him to}} become interested in the then new field of electrical power distribution in the early 1880s. Electric lighting was a growing business with many companies building outdoor direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) arc lighting based street lighting systems and Thomas Edison launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb. In 1884 he started developing his own DC domestic lighting system and hired physicist William Stanley to work on it. Westinghouse {{became aware of the}} new European alternating current systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. AC had the ability to be [...] "stepped up" [...] in voltage by a transformer for distribution long distances and then [...] "stepped down" [...] by a transformer for consumer use allowing large centralized power plants to supply electricity long distance in cities with more disperse populations. This was an advantage over the low voltage DC systems being marketed by Thomas Edison's electric utility which had a limited range due to the low voltages used. Westinghouse saw AC's potential to achieve greater economies of scale as way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.|$|E
