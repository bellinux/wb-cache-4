However, {{it was only when}} Wood saw her act in a show by BBC Scotland called Eighty-One Take Two that she was impressed enough to hire her friend for the show. Imrie played various roles throughout the run, like a co-presenter of McConomy (a spoof TV economy show), and most famously Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques. Imrie said in 2007, [...] "Miss Babs is still what I'm best known for, even though I don't go around with bright yellow hair." [...] During her run in As Seen On TV Imrie received a fan letter from playwright Alan Bennett. [...] "He wrote a card to me saying he adored Miss Babs. You can't imagine how thrilling that was. I still have that card today." [...] Imrie though believes that the praise should go to Wood's writing: [...] "Every word is of huge importance and crafted to perfection. It was a wonderful, happy accident <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E

Rolling Stone called the song [...] "reflective," [...] while Consequence of Sound {{commented that the}} song is [...] "relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you for the 97th time tonight' and 'If I could ask God just one question: Why aren’t you here with me tonight?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dönitz {{disputed the}} propriety of his trial at Nuremberg, commenting on count (2) [...] "One of the 'accusations' that made me guilty during this trial was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> and planned {{the course of the}} war with Hitler; now I ask them in heaven’s name, how could an admiral do {{otherwise}} with his country's head of state in a time of war?" [...] Over 100 senior Allied officers also sent letters to Dönitz conveying their disappointment over the fairness and verdict of his trial.|$|E

And we thought, {{what if we}} had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior– Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw Pong, and I said, well, that's the arena for him. And {{at the same time}} I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and when I got into <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> a bunch of programmers who were into all that.

2500|$|Since 1906, {{with his}} cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their {{neighbour}} in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note [...] "Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun-running conspiracy." [...] (p23). At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both {{came very close}} to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case. In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, [...] as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain’s Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this hospitality, at great expense and risk on Atul’s side: [...] "We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. I have very often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could all work together. Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Jatin Mukherjee…". Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, [...] "some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India." [...] Atul’s elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.|$|E
