6000|$|On {{the second}} day a band might have been seen (had the smoke {{permitted}} it) assembling at the sally-port of Fort Potato, and have been heard (if the <b>tremendous</b> <b>clang</b> of the cannonading had allowed it) giving mysterious signs and countersigns. [...] "Tom," [...] was the word whispered, [...] "Steele" [...] was the sibilated response. (It is astonishing how, in the roar of elements, THE HUMAN WHISPER hisses above all!) It was the Irish Brigade assembling. [...] "Now or never, boys!" [...] said their leaders; and sticking their doodeens into their mouths, they dropped stealthily into the trenches, heedless of the broken glass and sword-blades; rose from those trenches; formed in silent order; and marched to Paris. They knew they could arrive there unobserved--nobody, indeed, remarked their absence.|$|E
60|$|So Deacon Lawson {{and half}} a score of his townsmen took down the bell, {{suspended}} it on a pole, and bore it away on their sturdy shoulders, meaning to carry it to the shore of Lake Champlain, and thence homeward by water. Far through the woods gleamed the flames of Our Lady's Chapel, flinging fantastic shadows from the clustered foliage, and glancing on brooks that had never caught the sunlight. As the rangers traversed the midnight forest, staggering under their heavy burden, the tongue of the bell gave many a <b>tremendous</b> stroke,--clang, <b>clang,</b> clang!--a most doleful sound, {{as if it were}} tolling for the slaughter of the priests and the ruin of the chapel. Little dreamed Deacon Lawson and his townsmen that it was their own funeral knell. A war-party of Indians had heard the report, of musketry, and seen the blaze of the chapel, and now were on the track of the rangers, summoned to vengeance by the bell's dismal murmurs. In the midst of a deep swamp, they made a sudden onset on the retreating foe. Good Deacon Lawson battled stoutly, but had his skull cloven by a tomahawk, and sank into the depths of the morass, with the ponderous bell above him. And, for many a year thereafter, our hero's voice was heard no more on earth, neither at the hour of worship, nor at festivals nor funerals.|$|R
