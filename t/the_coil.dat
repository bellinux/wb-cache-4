5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coil</b> of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> so that an additional resonator is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> has to be there in any case.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>coils</b> are stationary, no current is induced. But when <b>the</b> small <b>coil</b> is moved {{in or out}} of <b>the</b> large <b>coil</b> (B), <b>the</b> magnetic flux through <b>the</b> large <b>coil</b> changes, inducing a current which is detected by the galvanometer (G).|$|R
5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. <b>The</b> <b>coil</b> either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

We use two kinds of yield stress fluids, shaving foam and hair gel, and show that <b>the</b> <b>coiling</b> of <b>the</b> foam is similar to <b>the</b> <b>coiling</b> of an elastic rope. Two regimes of coiling (elastic and gravitational) are observed for the foam. Hair gel <b>coiling,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, is more like <b>the</b> <b>coiling</b> of a liquid system; here we observe viscous and gravitational regimes.

25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling <b>the</b> <b>coil,</b> by conducting heat away from <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

25|$|The Bellini–Tosi system {{feeds the}} output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna {{into a small}} coil of wire, the field coil. The varying voltage induced by the {{received}} signal causes the wire to re-radiate the same signal. Although as <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> is typically very {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller physical area, so the flux may be much higher than the original signal.|$|E

25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the tuned circuit and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in <b>the</b> <b>coil)</b> to form the tuned circuit with <b>the</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, Mechenex's head {{contractor}} {{would not}} accept <b>the</b> TCA <b>coils</b> due to <b>the</b> difference in the specifications, and as a result, Mechenex refused to pay TCA for <b>the</b> <b>coils,</b> on <b>the</b> basis that TCA had supplied the wrong type of coils.

50|$|The main {{weakness}} of the ampere balance is that the calculation of the current involves the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>coils.</b> So <b>the</b> accuracy of the current measurement {{is limited by the}} accuracy with which <b>the</b> <b>coils</b> can be measured, and their mechanical rigidity.|$|R
50|$|At {{the sending}} end {{there were two}} rows of buttons, a pair of buttons for each coil in each row. The {{operator}} selected one button from each row. This connected two of <b>the</b> <b>coils</b> to <b>the</b> positive and negative ends of the battery respectively. The other ends of <b>the</b> <b>coils</b> were connected to the telegraph wires and thence to one end of <b>the</b> <b>coils</b> at <b>the</b> receiving station. The other end of <b>the</b> receiving <b>coils,</b> while in receive mode, were all commoned together. Thus the current flowed through <b>the</b> same two <b>coils</b> at both ends and energised the same two needles.

25|$|A more-sophisticated probe {{includes}} a magnetic flux sensor (Hall effect sensor) in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low frequency) current into <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> {{to cancel the}} sensed field; the magnitude of that current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down to DC. <b>The</b> <b>coil</b> still picks up high frequencies.

25|$|The {{voice coil}} itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, {{and made of}} doubly coated copper magnet wire. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> {{together}} after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> along {{the two sides of}} the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) then interact with the magnetic field of the fixed magnet. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the tangential force. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.|$|E

Luminal protease activity {{was found in the}} crop, the style sac and <b>the</b> <b>coiled</b> gut and was significantly higher in <b>the</b> <b>coiled</b> gut. Several protease bands and their apparent molecular weights were identified in both tissue extracts and luminal contents by gel zymography: (1) a 125 kDa protease in salivary gland extracts and in the crop content; (2) a 30 kDa protease throughout all studied luminal contents and in extracts of the midgut gland and of the endosymbionts isolated from this gland; (3) two proteases of 145 and 198 kDa in <b>the</b> <b>coiled</b> gut content. All these proteases were inhibited by aprotinin, a serine-protease inhibitor, and showed maximum activity between 30 °C and 35 °C and pH between 8. 5 and 9. 5.

25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of <b>the</b> <b>coil.</b> Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so <b>the</b> <b>coil</b> generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so {{there are more than a}} hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of <b>the</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{tungsten}} light bulb filaments attempts to reduce creep deformation.
