5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> Unlike small caliber guns {{which can be}} field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|One 135-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday morning before the Saturday afternoon race. Alex Tagliani was fastest in the session, {{which took place in}} dry, warm weather conditions, with a lap of 24.811 seconds; Tora Takagi was second, and da Matta third. Francitti was fourth-fastest, and Carpentier rounded out the session's top five drivers. Seven yellow caution flags were shown: the first two were for track inspections, the next two were for debris located in turns three and four. The fifth caution was for Shinji Nakano who stopped at the bottom of turns three and four with smoke billowing from his engine which dropped oil on the track that needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> The sixth was caused by Michel Jourdain Jr. when his engine failed and stopped between turns three and four and his car was extracted from the circuit, and the final was for Scott Dixon who slowed on the backstretch with a loss of engine power.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned.</b> A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E

5|$|Coletti, Leal, Dillmann, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon, Binder, Giovesi, Haryanto, Rosenzweig and Abt {{were all}} {{trapped in the}} {{blockade}} {{with varying degrees of}} car damage. Nasr was near Bird and Ceccon and managed to avoid the collision between Leal and Palmer. Drivers ran back to their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take the restart. A forty-minute delay was necessitated to allow the track <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cleaned</b> before the race could be restarted. Nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement from the race: Cecotto, Leimer, Palmer, Leal, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon and Giovesi. The running order at the restart was determined by the order of the drivers that went through the first sector with the cars that did not enter being put in their starting position. This meant Evans led the field behind the safety car followed by Bird, Ceccon, Nasr and Calado. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two and racing resumed with Evans leading Bird. Both drivers opened up a two-second advantage over Ceccon, Nasr, Calado and Richelmi. Although Evans had switched to the supersoft tyres during the stoppage Bird set consecutive fastest laps of the race on the soft tyres.|$|E
