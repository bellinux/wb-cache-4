5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of {{the military}} included disbanding the female branches of the three services. The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, Australian Women's Army Service and Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force had been formed during 1941 and 1942 to enable women {{to serve in the}} military but were disbanded during 1947, with military service being again restricted to men. Demobilised service women were provided with similar assistance to male members {{of the military}}, but were placed under pressure to return to <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> roles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> {{structure}} in the United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many stereotypes, and men may have {{difficulties}} accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The stay-at-home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E

5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2005, {{there was}} a public protest against the law. Protesters — led by People's Party members, Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum (Foro Español de la Familia) — said they had rallied 1.5 million people against what they {{considered}} {{an attack on the}} <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> and Spanish values; the Government's Delegation in Madrid counted 166,000 at the same event. Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with Gay Pride Day, FELGT (Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E

5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

30|$|In <b>traditional</b> <b>families</b> women held {{de facto}} power for making {{important}} family decisions {{since they were}} responsible for performing housework {{and taking care of}} family members, but their power in decision-making needed formal approval from their husband, who symbolized the head of the family (Li 2010). Departing from the fact that women exercise power implicitly in <b>traditional</b> <b>families,</b> the mothers interviewed in this study had explicit power in decision making, and in most cases, they only involved their husband in the discussion or simply informed them about their decisions.|$|R

It appears {{the role of women in}} Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{health status of}} the {{children}} and the adult members of the large families living in rural areas we surveyed 770 children and 393 their parents of 204 large families.

Non-traditional families include divorced families, single-parent families, opposite-sex partners, and same-sex partners.

25|$|The strong mother/weak or distant father {{parenting}} style {{typically associated with}} early psychoanalytic attempts to explain homosexuality was also used to further discredit Zinzendorf. As a student, Zinzendorf was known for being frivolous, even bringing a cat to class. At the age of sixteen, he was named vice-elder of the Single Brothers Choir. Moravian communities were dedicated to serving Christ. The <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> unit was abandoned in order to direct all residents' energies to that goal.

25|$|In the United States, {{attitudes about}} people who are {{homosexual}} may vary on the basis of partisan identification.

This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or conservatism with respect to the <b>traditional</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
