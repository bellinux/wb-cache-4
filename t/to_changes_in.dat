5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> a small set of conserved genes.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{properties}} of the eye, including the refractive compensation, for example, may change if there are <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> any of the components {{that make up the}} eye.   The sensitivity <b>to</b> such <b>changes</b> is quantified via the derivative.   This paper employs the reduced eye and Gaussian optics to illustrate a general method for the analysis of sensitivity in eyes.   The method requires a clear statement of the dependent variable as a function of independent variables.   A symbolism is offered that makes the function unambiguous.   Sensitivities are determined for the fundamental optical properties, the transference and the corneal-plane refractivecompensation of a reduced eye <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power, curvature and radius of curvature and <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> axial length and index of refraction.   Emsley’s reduced eye is examined in particular.   Its corneal-plane refractive compensation has a sensitivity of  135 − 135 D <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> refractive index,  1 − 2. 7 D/mm <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> length and  135 − 1 / 3 <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal curvature when the other two independent variables are held fixed.   The method has the potential to develop guidelines that are useful clini- cally. </p...|$|R

The participants were 209 peoples with alcohol dependence.

Data were analyzed with the SPSS 19. 0 programs. The significant predictors of motivation <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> peoples with alcohol dependence were gratitude, professional support, and age at first admission. These alcohol drinking-related factors and psychosocial factors explained 22. 7 % of the variance in peoples with an alcohol dependence.
