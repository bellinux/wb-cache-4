40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death worldwide. There is a {{consistent}} inverse relationship between fruit intake with CVD events and mortality in cross-sectional and prospective observational studies, but the relationship of fruit intake with measurements of atherosclerosis in humans is less clear. Nutritional effects on abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), a marker for subclinical intimal and medial atherosclerotic vascular disease, have not been studied previously. The aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship of total and individual fruit (apple, pear, orange and other citrus, and banana) intake with AAC, scored between 0 and 24. The current study assessed baseline data for a cohort of 1052 women over 70 years of age who completed both a food frequency questionnaire assessing fruit intake, and underwent AAC measurement using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. AAC scores were significantly negatively correlated with total fruit and apple intakes (p 0. 25). In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, each standard deviation (SD; 50 g/day) increase in apple intake was associated with a 24 % lower odds of having severe AAC (AAC score > 5) (odd ratio OR) : 0. 76 (0. 62, 0. 93), p = 0. 009). <b>Total</b> and <b>other</b> individual <b>fruit</b> intake were not associated with increased odds of having severe AAC. Apple but not <b>total</b> or <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> intake is independently negatively associated with AAC in older women...|$|R
