5|$|Football resumed {{after the}} war for the 1919–20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup {{at the end of}} season, beating Huddersfield Town 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus {{becoming}} the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923–24, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was to be something of a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop <b>the</b> <b>slump</b> with transfer dealings. In 1927, they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, they bought {{in one of the most}} prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £4,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals.|$|E
5|$|The boom in {{skyscraper}} construction {{began to}} falter following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, with fast economic growth {{giving way to}} <b>the</b> <b>slump</b> years of the Great Depression: construction of all sorts slowed considerably. The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, {{and the value of}} many properties dropped dramatically: the American Insurance Union tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m). The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt.

5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and <b>the</b> <b>slump</b> in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop.

40|$|Current X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM were {{designed}} and built to privilege the angular resolution or the collecting area respectively, but using two different manufacturing techniques, and these two key aspects could not be optimised at the same time. The {{result is that the}} high-redshift X-ray Universe is still too unresolved to provide us with the understanding of the time evolution of the universe as we see it nowadays. Now the ATHENA mission, approved for the L 2 slot in the Cosmic Vision program, is required to have an effective area of 2 m 2 at 1 keV and an angular resolution better than 5 arcsec Half-Energy Width (HEW). At this regard, in addition to the baseline solution based on Silicon Pore Optics (SPO), thin glass foils are considered a viable alternative. Slumped glass foils are also considered as substrates for X-ray optics being developed in other projects; for example, the X-ray Surveyor mission being developed at SAO/CfA in USA, and the AXYOM project being developed in Italy. They both foresee the use of piezo-electric actuators to correct the shape errors of the mirrors. The Brera Astronomical Observatory (INAF-OAB, Merate - Italy) has been working, from 2009 till 2013, under ESA contract aimed to develop in Europe a Slumped Glass Optics (SGO) technology, alternative to the one based on silicon pores, and based on <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> of thin glass foils, in parallel to the work being carried out at NASA/GSFC and other institutes. The INAFOAB innovation is the use of pressure in <b>the</b> hot <b>slumping</b> process to replicate the mould figure. This technology is coupled with an integration process able to damp low frequency errors. My Ph. D. activity, carried out at the INAF-OAB, is devoted to the advancement in <b>the</b> hot <b>slumping</b> technology assisted by pressure, for the production of glass mirrors for future X-ray telescopes. As a preliminary work, I have developed a new method to precisely characterise the mid frequency errors of the glass foils. An existing model, developed by Jimenez-Garate in 2003 to account for the relaxation of ripples in <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> glass foil when in contact with <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> mould, was modified to include the application of pressure, and the model was compared to the experimental results. The pressure was found to be essential, also from the the theory viewpoint, to reduce mid-frequency errors in <b>the</b> profile of <b>slumped</b> glass foils, which crucially degrade the performances of the optics. As for <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> process, I have introduced a new glass material (Corning Eagle XG) combined with the Schott Zerodur K 20, already chosen at earlier times as slumping mould material for its anti-sticking properties. I have developed cleaning protocols, used different thermal cycles and different pressures conditions, and reconditioned the pressure control system. I have also optimised the mould height with experiments based on Finite Element Analysis, and reduced the thermal gradients inside the mould and the glass foils. The final result obtained in this research are slumped glass foils with angular resolution improved from the initial 7 arcsec to 2. 2 ± 0. 3 arcsec in single reflection, as expected from metrology at 1 keV X-ray energy and 0. 7 incidence angle, and computed by simulating a perfect integration. This result has to be compared with 2 arcsec defined as the error budget allocated for <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> glass foils. About 1 arcsec is due to replication of the mid-frequency errors in <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> mould which, owing to the improved result in <b>the</b> <b>slumping,</b> are now a limiting factor in the quality of <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> glass foils. From the roughness point of view, the contribution to the HEW is guaranteed to be less then 1 arcsec at 1 keV, with an rms improvement from 21 to 11 Å throughout my Ph. D. Moreover, the last tests carried out proved that the roughness of <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> glass foils can be further reduced to _ 7 Å, making the technology attractive also for higher X-ray energies and higher incidence angles. <b>The</b> glass foils <b>slumped</b> during this Ph. D. have been used for the production of two SGO Proof Of Concept prototypes (POC) for the ATHENA mission: the POC# 3, (with 2 glass foils assembled) is characterised by HEW value of 5. 5 arcsec at 0. 27 keV in the best portion of the module, as tested at the PANTER facility; the POC# 4 (with 8 glass foils) has expected HEW of about 15 arcsec from metrological data, but the result in X-ray was much higher because of accidental problems during the integration. The next prototype, the POC# 5 (with the best eight glass foils produced during my Ph. D. activity), will soon be integrated and tested in X-rays, to assess the improvement already proven by metrology and simulations. Some of <b>the</b> produced <b>slumped</b> glass foils have also been used for studies of active profile corrections with piezoelectric elements, both for the AXYOM project and X-ray Surveyor mission. Alternative materials and techniques have been used in this research to further improve the result. To reduce the surface micro-roughness of <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> glass foils, I have proven that <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> technique with pressure application can also be suited in <b>the</b> indirect <b>slumping,</b> in which <b>the</b> optical surface of the glass is not in contact with the mould, thus preserving its initial surface smoothness. Moreover, the dip coating technique was studied to fill the micro-pores present on the surface of <b>the</b> glass foils <b>slumped</b> with <b>the</b> direct technique. Alternative materials for <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> mould were tested, defining Si 3 N 4 as a very promising candidate, owing to its higher rigidity with respect to Zerodur K 20 and therefore preferable to avoid mould deformations with <b>the</b> <b>slumping,</b> as experienced with K 20. The Gorilla glass (normally used for smartphones and tablets), was proven to preserve the surface quality of the glass foils, once slumped and chemically tempered to increase the mirror endurance against the vibrations experienced at launch. Finally, I have also studied the scattering and the reflectivity properties of multilayer coatings for X-ray optics. I have upgraded an IDL code to simulate the roughness growth in the multilayer deposition process, extending the computations from periodic to the more general case of graded multilayers. I have also contributed to the X-ray measurements at the BEAR beamline of the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, on multilayers deposited on glass, silicon and electroformed nickel, for the polarimetric LAMP projec...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{object of}} this {{research}} study is to investigate and provide some fundamental information about bed slumping in a partially defluidized bed combustor. Due to the difficulty in making measurements and observations at high temperature, a dynamically similar cold phase fluidized bed was used to model the high temperature case. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 305 m by 2. 44 m cold fluidized bed which has plexiglass windows along the sides to provide adequate visualization of the fluidizing phenomena. The heat exchange tube array comprising six staggered rows of horizontal tubes 0. 0125 m O. D. {{was placed in the}} bed. Zirconia sand particles of diameter d[supscript p] = 305 microns were used to simulate the mixture of 1200 micron limestone and coal particles. Gas velocities used in the experiment were varied from minimum fluidizing velocity to six times minimum fluidizing velocity. On defluidizing half of the fluidized bed, bed material from the active portion of the bed began transferring to <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> side of <b>the</b> bed, this caused a ridge of solids to form and grow on <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> surface. Correlations were then developed to describe the changing contours of <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> bed surface. A major factor in the entrainment of bed material from the fluidized beds is the ejection of particles when bubbles break the bed surface. The initial velocities of ejected particles can be associated with the velocity of rising bubbles from potential flow theory. A simple model was developed to predict the motions and trajectories of ejected particles in the freeboard region. This model predicted the rate of bed material transfer from the active side to the defluidized section of the bed. These predictions were tested by experiment and showed good agreement. A correlation of the experimentally found particle density function for transferred material is presented. This can be used to determine the total amount of bed material transfer at any defluidization time. The study of the gas flow in <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> portion of <b>the</b> bed was also conducted by measuring the pressure profiles in both sections of the bed. The amount of gas bypass through <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> bed was determined by the Ergun equation and these pressure profiles. The results indicate that the percentage of the gas bypass through <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> section does not depend on the superficial velocity. Necessary conditions required to completely refluidize <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> section of <b>the</b> bed after a long period of defluidization were obtained from the pressure-time trace study. It was found that complete refluidization of <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> section could not be achieved by using superficial refluidizing velocities of less than two times minimum fluidizing velocity. Study of the lateral mixing of solids in a wide shallow fluidized bed was conducted by using the ferrite tracer technique. A simple unsteady diffusion equation was used successfully to model the dispersion of solids from the refluidized bed to the active bed. The lateral dispersion coefficient of solids was found to depend on the superficial velocity and so was the rate of the solids mixing. Finally, the results obtained from the room temperature bed were converted to those in the high temperature case by using similarity analysis. Comparison of the converted results with the available data from the high temperature bed indicated good agreement, and thus, a successful simulation...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{objective}} of this research project was to investigate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the behavior of materials in partially slumped fluidized beds. View windows {{along the side of}} the experiment facility made visual observations of bed profiles possible. These observations were recorded on movie films showing the effects of variations in slumping length, bed depth and fluidizing velocity. Quantitative experiments were also carried out under different sets of experimental conditions with pressure drops across the bed being recorded. Dimensional analysis then correlates the pressure drops, to Reynolds number, Froude number, <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> ratio of bed depth and particle size. Plots were constructed to show the trend of variation in the pressure drop versus that of Reynolds number and logarithm of Froude number, respectively, holding <b>the</b> <b>slumping</b> ratio and <b>the</b> ratio of bed depth to particle size constant. Statistical regression techniques were employed to develop two mathematical models that provide quantitative predictions of the pressure distribution in a <b>slumped</b> fluidized bed. <b>The</b> results showed formation of ridges when the bed was slumped; movement of the position of the ridge and also changes in its height. No difficulty was encountered when <b>the</b> <b>slumped</b> region was refluidized if the bed is originally fluidized under bubbling conditions.
