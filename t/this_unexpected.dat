5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more Caesar was to lead the way, with the {{intention}} of splitting the enemy fleet in half. Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that Caesar was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down the outside of the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; Queen, coming behind Caesar, attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Unable to effectively manoeuvre, Queen passed down the outside of the French line, firing as she went.|$|E

5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Major General George B. McClellan, {{commanding}} the Army of the Potomac, determined {{to take the}} Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army of the Potomac was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe {{at the end of}} the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many other elements of the Army of the Potomac, up the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Many Muslims {{considered}} <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> victory a {{proof that}} they had been favored by God and believed they were assured such victories in the future. A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.|$|E

60|$|At <b>this</b> very <b>unexpected</b> reply, {{the spectators}} tittered again, and Dodson & Fogg, turning very red, {{leaned over to}} Serjeant Buzfuz, and in a hurried manner whispered {{something}} in his ear.|$|R
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{historical}} record that spans {{the greater part of}} the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers. Copán was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the southern Maya area. The city suffered a major political disaster in AD738 when Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, one of the greatest kings in Copán's dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of Quiriguá. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Howe defied naval {{convention}} {{by ordering}} his fleet to turn towards the French {{and for each}} of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> order was not understood by all of his captains, {{and as a result}} his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade {{for the remainder of the}} war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the {{training}} squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, {{during the course of}} one of these journeys, Markham was elected in absentia President of the RGS. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> elevation {{was the result of a}} dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893 the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy. Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was raised in the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander (KCB), and became Sir Clements Markham.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> unusual, <b>unexpected,</b> and unseasonably strong typhoon killed 204 {{people and}} caused and nearly $23 million in damage (1972 USD) in the Philippines. The {{destruction}} was mostly due to rains and flooding.|$|R

5|$|The {{top five}} {{conglomerates}} in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2013 Wyangala Waters State Park advertised for expressions of interest to remove the water slides from within the Park. The slides {{had not been in}} use due to problems of Park management finding a suitable operator. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> announcement by the Park resulted in an extensive campaign to save the slides.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> reprieve, however, led to {{a brutal}} death march: for the next week, the prisoners were forced by SS {{soldiers}} wielding wooden clubs and steel bars to march 21 miles a day at top speed. In the blazing July heat, the emaciated prisoners were deprived {{of food and water}} and allowed to rest only at night. Those who couldn't keep up were shot.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> and {{unlikely}} victory made Shivaji {{a hero of}} Maratha folklore and a legendary figure among his people. The large quantities of captured weapons, horses, armour and other materials helped to strengthen the nascent and emerging Maratha army. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb now identified Shivaji as {{a major threat to}} the mighty Mughal Empire. Soon thereafter Shivaji, Shahaji and Netaji Palkar (the chief of the Maratha cavalry) decided to attack and defeat the Adilshahi kingdom at Bijapur.|$|E
25|$|Sweden was able, {{thanks to}} their conquests in the Thirty Years' War, to attack Denmark from the south {{as well as the}} east; the Dutch {{alliance}} promised to secure them at sea. In May, the Swedish Privy Council decided upon war; on 12 December the Swedish Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson, advancing from Bohemia, crossed the southern frontier of Denmark; by the end of January 1644 the whole peninsula of Jutland was in Swedish hands. <b>This</b> <b>unexpected</b> attack, conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity, had a paralysing effect upon Denmark.|$|E

25|$|After <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> success, McLeish and his Rangers team {{headed into}} the 2005–06 SPL {{campaign}} as favourites to retain the championship. McLeish {{made a number of}} signings, including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray, despite having little money to spend. After a reasonable start to the season, including a win over Celtic, Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November. This period included a club record of 10 games without a win. However the tenth match of this run, a 1–1 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League, took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time.|$|E
25|$|In 1839 the Daoguang Emperor, rejecting {{proposals}} to legalise and tax opium, appointed viceroy Lin Zexu {{to solve the}} problem by banning the opium trade. Lin confiscated around 20,000 chests of opium (approximately 1210tons or 2.66millionpounds) without offering compensation and ordered a blockade of foreign trade in Canton. The British government, although not officially denying China's right to control imports of the drug, objected to <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> seizure and dispatched a military force to China. In the ensuing conflict the Royal Navy used its naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire, a tactic later referred to as gunboat diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of musketry started which lasted half an hour, and caused much loss. Other Prussian battalions now hastened across the village, but all at once, a rumour flew rapidly among them, that the French were {{in possession of}} the Churchyard, {{and in a moment}} several muskets were aimed in that direction, and either thoughtlessly or nervously discharged. Those battalions that were in front, at the outlet of the village, became alarmed by <b>this</b> <b>unexpected</b> firing in their rear. At the same time, a discharge of grape, from some guns suddenly brought forward by the French, in their immediate front, augmented their confusion, and they retreated. They were closely pursued by the French, whose skirmishers made a dash at the colour of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment, which they would have captured but for a very determined defence.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{astonishing}} situation, and imposingly dramatic. Nobody had looked for <b>this.</b> The <b>unexpected</b> had happened. What next? But {{there can be}} no next; the play is over; the grand climax is reached; the possibilities are exhausted; ring down the curtain.|$|R
