5|$|Gandhi {{called his}} ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He {{believed}} that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{rejected}} the colonial Western format of education system. He {{stated that it}} led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E

25|$|The axiomatic {{approach}} Arrow adopted can <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> conceivable rules (that {{are based}} on preferences) within one unified framework. In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{and most}} other industrialized nations, {{emergency}} medical providers are required to treat any patient that has a life-threatening condition, irrespective of the patient's financial resources.

25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{discriminate}} against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.|$|E

At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually.

25|$|The Old Calendarists {{have two}} {{hierarchies}} which consider themselves Western jurisdictions and therefore have no liaison, citing the canonical responsibility of bishops {{to their local}} territories, opting to simply <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> parishes of Western and Eastern Rite equally. Of these, the larger Western Rite organization is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, with the presiding hierarch, Metropolitan John LoBue of New York and New Jersey, the only Orthodox bishop in North America who regularly employs Western usage in his monastery.|$|E

At least 80 critically injured people were transported to Bireun Hospital as hospitals in Pidie and Pidie Jaya were overwhelmed. An additional 38 doctors were placed on standby. As the hospital lacks an intensive care unit, treatment could only be done outdoors in tents. Hospital officials later stated that they only accepted those with serious injuries, while people with minor injuries such as cuts were denied treatment. On 8 December 2016 the hospital stated that they will <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> injured for free.|$|E
25|$|The Mapocho River, which {{crosses the}} city from the {{northeast}} to the southwest of the Central Valley, remains contaminated by household, agricultural, and industrial sewage, and by upstream copper-mining waste (there {{are a number of}} copper mines in the Andes east of Santiago), which is dumped untreated into the river. Laws exist which require industries and local governments to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> wastewater discharges, but these regulations are often loosely enforced. There are now a number of large wastewater processing and recycling plants under construction, and ongoing plans to decontaminate the river and make it navigable.|$|E
25|$|In August of {{the year}} 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by Joannes, who had held the office of Primicerius Notariorum. Joannes appears to have ushered {{in a period of}} {{religious}} toleration. Joannes seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> people equally. In the year 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether they were really such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals {{decide that the}} medical resources available are not sufficient to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> {{the people who need}} help. The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because of the severity of their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E
25|$|La Cruz Blanca Neutral (The Neutral White Cross) was a {{volunteer}} infirmary and relief service established during the Mexican Revolution {{to care for}} those wounded in the conflict. The Red Cross refused to treat insurgents and the Neutral White Cross was developed to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> combatants. After their initial success in Ciudad Juárez, the organization spread out through 25 states in Mexico {{for the duration of}} the war. It continued as a quasi-governmentally subsidized organization into the 1940s, when it was converted into an organization to assist children. The organization is still operating in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{department}} overcrowding is when {{function of}} a department is hindered by an inability to <b>treat</b> <b>all</b> patients in an adequate manner. This is a common occurrence in emergency departments worldwide. Overcrowding causes inadequate patient care which leads to poorer patient outcomes. To address this problem, escalation policies are used by emergency departments when responding {{to an increase in}} demand (e.g., a sudden inflow of patients) or a reduction in capacity (e.g., a lack of beds to admit patients). The policies aim to maintain the ability to deliver patient care, without compromising safety, by modifying ‘normal’ processes.|$|E
