The plan was that non-EU countries would also agree to disclose information about the interest earned by EU residents. Many non-EU states and countries agreed to introduce similar measures. These countries included most tax havens and dependent territories of the EU countries. Countries such as the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Andorra, Turks & Caicos, British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Switzerland, and many others thus agreed to implement similar or <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangements</b> (see below).

40|$|Much of {{the gender}} {{inequality}} in the labour market is brought about by women's dual role as worker and (potential) carer.

This paper looks at these issues in light of the transitional labour market (TLM) concept. The first section discusses various gender-equality models which imply different ways of organising, for example, childcare, parental leave and flexible working time. Sections two and three look at gender inequalities in labour market outcomes and discuss <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangements</b> that can contribute to the achievement of more gender equality in six countries taken as examples. The last section discusses the results of the labour market and institutional analysis in light of the TLM concept. Gender, labour market, transitional labour markets, childcare, parental leave, flexible working time. ...|$|R
