I don't wonder at your mention of the friends whom we have lost by death. Bowles the poet still lives, and Rogers--all that survive of the poetical fraternity with whom I have had any intimacy. Southey, Campbell, and Cary, are no more. Of my class-fellows and schoolfellows very few remain; my intimate associates of my own college are all gone long since. Myers my cousin, <b>Terrot,</b> Jones my fellow-traveller, Fleming and his brother Raincock of Pembroke, Bishop Middleton of the same college--it has pleased God that I should survive them all. Then there are none left but Joseph Cottle of the many friends I made at Bristol and in Somersetshire; yet we are only in our 75th year. But enough of this sad subject; let us be resigned under all dispensations, and thankful; for that is our duty, however difficult {{it may be to}} perform it. I send you the lock of hair which you desired, white as snow, and taken from a residue which is thinning rapidly.|$|E

50|$|Drummond appears highly {{affected}} by the Oxford Movement of 1840. In October 1842 his religious views {{came to a head}} in a series of open letters to Bishop Charles <b>Terrot</b> (perhaps fuelled by the impending doom of his church structure). The conclusion of this was a growing schism, causing Drummond to resign from the Scottish Episcopal Church. He was then encouraged to set up a parallel church that claimed allegiance to the Church of England and continued the bulk of the previous Episcopal customs, but with more freedom of prayer outwith the church setting. This was thereafter known as the English Church in Edinburgh. This split was parallel to, but technically separate from, the more famous split in the Church of Scotland, generally termed the Disruption of 1843. Drummond's lead formed a pattern which several other Scottish Episcopalian Churches followed.Drummond's new church was St Thomas's on Rutland Place/Rutland Street (at the west end of Princes Street), a location which {{can only be described as}} “annoyingly close” to the established Edinburgh Episcopal Church of St John the Evangelist (sitting more or less opposite the entrance to the established church. St Thomas's was designed by David Cousin, architect. Curiously this building was begun in 1842, indicating a pre-emption of the entire schism, and indicating that the series of letters to Bishop <b>Terrot</b> were merely to formalise an already concluded decision. The first call to a public meeting to establish a new church appears in the Caledonian Mercury newspaper on 27 October 1842, predating much of the debate between Drummond and <b>Terrot.</b> Drummond's address at this time is shown as 4 Bruntsfield Place.|$|E

5000|$|Before the Disruption of 1843 in the Church of Scotland, Marshall {{generally}} sympathised with non-intrusionist party; but in {{the event}} he broke with the Free Church and became an Anglican. He sent in his resignation to the presbytery of Edinburgh on 29 September 1841, and, after being confirmed by Charles <b>Terrot,</b> the Bishop of Edinburgh, was ordained by Edward Maltby, the Bishop of Durham as curate to William Stephen Gilly at Norham (19 December).

5000|$|Which [...] "foreign sky" [...] Macrobius {{was born}} under {{has been the}} subject of much speculation. <b>Terrot</b> Glover {{considers}} Macrobius either an ethnic Greek, or born in one of the Greek-speaking parts of the Roman Empire, such as Egypt, due to his intimate knowledge of Greek literature. J. E. Sandys went further and argued that Macrobius was born in one of the Greek provinces. However other experts, beginning with Ludwig van Jan, point out that despite his familiarity with Greek literature Macrobius was far more familiar with Latin than Greek—as evidenced by his enthusiasm for Vergil and Cicero—and favor North Africa, which was part of the Latin-speaking portion of the Roman Empire.|$|E

Ordained deacon and priest by Christopher Bethell, the Bishop of Gloucester in 1828, he served successively the curacies of Weston-sub-Edge in Gloucestershire, and Messing and Peldon in Essex, and became Rector of Leigh in Essex in 1837. Here, on {{the resignation of}} Bishop Low, he accepted the offer of the Scottish See of Moray and Ross; he was consecrated at Old Saint Paul's, Edinburgh, 9 March 1851.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work has been the advancement of selective adsorption techniques by use of new interactions and development of new approaches to the directed assembly of colloidal species. The ability to control the assembly from solution of complex and composite surface arrays by chemical patterning of surfaces is of great interest {{for the creation of}} nano- and micro-scale features without the costs and constraints of traditional lithography. Previous work in this group having demonstrated the patterning of polyelectrolyte multilayers by assembly on chemically-patterned surfaces, this thesis features a variation of selective adsorption in which polyelectrolytes of known substrate selectivity control the adsorption of the colloids onto which they are layered. The first section of this thesis will describe the evolution of this technique in response to certain limitations inherent to the patterning of multilayered films. Perfluorinated surfaces, proposed as potential adsorption resists, were found to display only partial or relative selectivity to common polyelectrolytes in the context of layer-by-layer assembly, an observation consistent with trends predicted by free-energy modeling. However, when these same polymers were layered on colloids, absolute selectivity could be more easily achieved. (cont.) Polyamine-directed colloidal assembly was studied first, demonstrating that layer-by-layer selectivity observations still held in this new approach and illustrating some unique advantages with regards to multicomponent assembly. To expand the reach of selective adsorption, specific recognition via multiple hydrogen bonding was explored as a guiding interaction. Nucleic base pairing, the MHB system at the heart of molecular biology, proved highly effective for selectivity. In particular, the mutual indifference of non-complementary groups makes MHB ideally suited to side-by-side deposition of different species. Natural RNA homopolymers were used at first for surface and colloidal modification, but proved too fragile and costly for extensive use. Instead, novel biomimetic polymers combining nucleic base side chains and stable backbone charge were synthesized, along with nucleic base-terminated triethoxysilanes for facile microcontact printing of nucleic base patterns. These new materials successfully replaced RNA as directors of selective assembly while improving reproducibility; in particular, their stability allowed exploration of new approaches to asymmetric functionalization. (cont.) Multilayered films of these polymers were also studied and found to exhibit interesting responses to changes in chemical environment. In the last section of this thesis, the synthesis and characterization of the nucleic base-grafted polyelectrolytes and triethoxysilanes will be reported. by Marianne S. <b>Terrot.</b> Thesis (Ph.
