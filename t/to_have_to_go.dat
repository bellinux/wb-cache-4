25|$|Although {{access to}} {{judicial}} review is restricted for ordinary questions of law, the Court of Justice has gradually developed {{a more open}} approach to standing for human rights. Human rights have also become essential in the proper interpretation and construction of all EU law. If there are two or more plausible interpretations of a rule, the one which is most consistent with human rights should be chosen. The Treaty of Lisbon 2007 made rights underpin the Court of Justice's competence, and required the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, overseen by the external Strasbourg Court. Initially, reflecting its primitive economic nature, the treaties made no reference to rights. However, in 1969 particularly after concern from Germany, the Court of Justice declared in Stauder v City of Ulm that 'fundamental human rights' were 'enshrined in the general principles of Community law'. This meant that Mr Stauder, who received subsidised butter under an EU welfare scheme only by showing a coupon with his name and address, was entitled to claim that this violated his dignity: he was entitled not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the humiliation of proving his identity to get food. While those 'general principles' were not written down in EU law, and simply declared to exist by the court, it accords with a majority philosophical view that 'black letter' rules, or positive law, necessarily exist for reasons that the society which made them wants: these give rise to principles, which inform the law's purpose. Moreover, the Court of Justice has clarified that its recognition of rights was 'inspired' by member states' own 'constitutional traditions', and international treaties. These include rights found in member state constitutions, bills of rights, foundational Acts of Parliament, landmark court cases, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter 1961, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, or the International Labour Organization's Conventions. The EU itself must accede to the ECHR, although in '’Opinion 2/13'’ the Court of Justice delayed, because of perceived difficulties in retaining an appropriate balance of competences.|$|E

Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, {{but if you are}} going to go that disturbed give me something like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E

That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're just going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent that we were going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

Cleverly set the pace of the fight throughout behind his jab and when he saw the chance, landed a flurry of punches. In the post-fight, Cleverly spoke of his game plan going into the fight, I thought sooner or later he was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but he was very tough.

[...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He {{looks to me like}} he maintains good concentration.

2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Elizabeth's {{personality}} and views has been compiled from impressions and descriptions by those she has met.

[...] After a weekend at Balmoral Castle hosted by the Queen, Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean recounted witnessing a relaxed, informal home life: Elizabeth and her family preparing a meal together—including a salad dressing devised by the Queen—and doing the washing up afterwards. Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, commented on Elizabeth's personality as [...] "individualistic". Hicks' mother remembers back to when George VI died.

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
