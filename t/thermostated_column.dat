40|$|This work {{describes}} a new method for {{the determination of}} perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in water matrices by suppressed conductivity detection. Separation was achieved by isocratic elution on a reversed-phase <b>column</b> <b>thermostated</b> at 45 °C using an aqueous mobile phase containing boric acid and acetonitrile. The PFOA and PFOS content in the water matrix were quantified by a pre-concentration technique. For the concentration range of 1 to 15 ng/mL and 2 to 30 ng/mL, the linear calibration curve for PFOA and PFOS yielded coefficients of determination (R 2) of 0. 9995 and 0. 9985, respectively. The relative standard deviations were smaller than 1. 5 % for PFOA and PFOS. The retention-time precision of four consecutive 12 h injections was smaller than 0. 641 % and 0. 818 %, respectively. The presence of common divalent cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron in water matrices impairs PFOS recovery. This drawback was overcome by applying inline matrix elimination method.
