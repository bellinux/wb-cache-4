40|$|Although {{several studies}} within the dual {{resource}} constrained (DRC) job shop literature have investigated {{issues related to}} worker flexibility, {{the costs associated with}} acquiring and operationalizing this flexibility have been addressed in a limited fashion. This study is aimed at understanding whether cross-training workers in DRC job shops in the presence of worker <b>transfer</b> <b>delays,</b> worker learning effects, and worker attrition improves shop performance. Two worker assignment control rules, and two rules to select the department for the transferring worker, are also tested to understand how workers should be assigned to alternate tasks in different departments. Results from our study indicate that cross-training workers in at least two different departments improves shop performance even when large <b>transfer</b> <b>delays</b> are present. Extensive cross-training is shown to increase the associated costs, especially for the centralized transfer rule. Consequently, the decentralized assignment control policy is recommended since it performs well even in the presence of large <b>transfer</b> <b>delays</b> for the cross-trained workers. Consistent with the prior literature, the rules to select the next department for the transferring worker are shown to have negligible impact on the shop performance.

50|$|A further {{restriction}} is {{that the}} leaky bucket as a queue traffic shaping function only transmits packets on the ticks; hence, if it is used within a network, equivalent to UPC and NPC, it also imposes a fixed phase on the onward transmission of packets. Whereas, when using a leaky bucket meter to control onward transmission, a packet is transmitted {{as soon as it}} conforms, i.e. relative to the previous one or, if it already conforms, its arrival time; not according to some arbitrary local clock. Perversely, {{in the context of the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>delay,</b> this imposition of a fixed phase that may, over time, differ from that of an otherwise conforming input packet stream, constitutes a delay variation and hence a jitter. Jitter caused in this particular way could only be observed where the delay is measured as the transit time between two separate measurement points, one either side of the leaky bucket as a queue shaping function. However, in the context of real-time data transmissions, it is this end-to-end delay that determines the latency of received data. Hence, the leaky bucket as a queue is unsuitable for traffic shaping real-time transmissions.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{high-voltage}} {{level shifter}} (HVLS) structure is proposed, {{which has a}} significantly improved transient response over existing structures. To overcome signal <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> of the conventional HVLS caused by parasitic capacitance due to high-voltage MOSFETs, this structure employs a novel circuit module “inverse Schmitt trigger” to drive the pull-up transistors of conventional HVLS.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of delayed hypersensitivity is poorly understood {{due in large}} part to limited techniques for in vitro study. With the exception of the human species, live leukocytes obtained from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, or peritoneal washings have been required to <b>transfer</b> <b>delayed</b> hypersensitivity from a sensitized donor to a normal recipient (1). Study of direct interaction between sensitized donor cells and antigen, in the recipient's skin, is hampered by the finding that most of the leukocytes at the site of a delayed reaction are from the recipient and not the donor (2). The present studies were designed to investigate the interaction of donor cells and antigens in vitro, and to study the effect of antigen exposure upon the ability of sensitized donor cells to <b>transfer</b> <b>delayed</b> sensitivity. The results indicate that exposure to certain antigens reduced or ablated the <b>transfer</b> of <b>delayed</b> hypersensitivity, and that this interference was related to the degree to which antigens remained associated with cells after exposure in vitro.

40|$|Abstract—Retransmission {{has been}} adopted {{as one of the}} most popular schemes for {{improving}} transmission reliability in wireless sensor networks. Many previous works have been done on reliable transmission issues in experimental ways, however, there still lack of analytical techniques to evaluate these solutions. Based on the traffic model, service model and energy model, we propose an analytical method to analyze the delay and energy metrics of two categories of retransmission schemes: hop-byhop retransmission (HBH) and end-to-end retransmission (ETE). With the experiment results, the maximum packet <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> and energy efficiency of these two scheme are compared in several scenarios. Moreover, the analytical results of <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> are validated through simulations.

40|$|Abstract [...] Enterprise access links remain {{bottlenecks}} even as LAN and WAN link rates increase. We verified {{this with}} an Internet traffic measurement study on our university's access link, which is presented here. To solve the problem, we propose a service called DUE (Dial-Up Ethernet). The service concept {{is to provide}} end hosts with a high-speed access circuit on a call-by-call shared basis. The DUE circuits map Ethernet segments at the end hosts into Ethernet-over-SONET signals and connect the end hosts directly to the IP router of the enterprise's Internet Service Provider (ISP). This results in lowered packet loss rates on the access link and thus translates into lower mean file <b>transfer</b> <b>delays.</b> The DUE service is proposed as an add-on to the primary Internet access service already available to enterprise hosts. If the circuit setup fails, the end host will fall back to the primary access link. If the circuit setup is successful, the end host will enjoy a much better performance on file <b>transfer</b> <b>delays.</b> For example, a 100 MB file transfer on a primary TCP/IP path with a round-trip propagation delay of 50 ms, the bottleneck link rate of 100 Mbps, and a packet loss rate of 0. 01 takes 441. 535 sec, while via an DUE circuit with the same bottleneck link rate and a reduced packet loss rate of 0. 00001, the transfer time is 10. 01 sec. To determine {{the conditions under which}} an end host with access to DUE service should attempt circuit setup, we analyze mean file <b>transfer</b> <b>delays</b> as a function of call blocking probabilities in the access network, packet loss rates on the end-to-end path, round-trip propagation delays, link rates, etc...|$|R
