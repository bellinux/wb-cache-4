5|$|At {{the start}} of the invasion, the {{manpower}} of the Soviet military force that had been mobilized was 5.3–5.5 million, and it was still increasing as the Soviet reserve force of 14 million, with at least basic military training, continued to mobilize. The Red Army was dispersed and still preparing when the invasion commenced. <b>Their</b> <b>units</b> were often separated and lacked adequate transportation.|$|E
5|$|Merging British and Italian Somaliland caused {{political}} controversy. The {{distribution of}} power between the two regions and among the major clans in both areas was a bone of contention. In December 1961, a group of British-trained northern non-commissioned officers in Hargeisa revolted after southern officers took command of <b>their</b> <b>units.</b> The rebellion was put down by other northern Noncommissioned officers (NCOs), although dissatisfaction in the north lingered.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November, Hermann Göring—Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe—ordered the 2. Jagddivision and the 3.

5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating <b>their</b> <b>units</b> at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and 90mm {{tank fire}} {{destroyed}} seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. This night battle, {{which was at}} times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated <b>their</b> <b>units</b> and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E

5|$|As the {{occupation}} duties were accomplished, {{the occupation}} force continued to downsize as more troops returned home and <b>their</b> <b>units</b> were inactivated. By 1950, the Sixth Army had left Japan, and the occupation force {{was reduced to}} the Eighth United States Army commanding two corps and four under-strength divisions; the I Corps, commanding the 24th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division, and the IX Corps, commanding the 1st Cavalry Division and the 7th Infantry Division. IX Corps had been moved to Sendai as the occupation forces shifted {{as a result of}} the downsizing. As part of further downsizing, IX Corps was inactivated on 28 March 1950, and its command responsibilities were consolidated with other units.|$|E
5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct <b>their</b> <b>units,</b> which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E

5|$|Karl Mack {{became the}} new main {{commander}} in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry {{on the eve}} of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training; new units were led by commanders who had not been given sufficient tactical training in using <b>their</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to <b>their</b> <b>units</b> where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command {{attempted}} {{to pinpoint the}} main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron's reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing <b>their</b> <b>units</b> to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no attempt was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E

5|$|Noel Francis Parrish (November 11, 1909– April 7, 1987) was a Brigadier General in the United States Air Force who was {{the white}} {{commander}} {{of a group of}} black airmen known as the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. He was a key factor in the program's success and in <b>their</b> <b>units</b> being assigned to combat duty. Parrish {{was born and raised in}} the south-east United States; he joined the U.S. Army in 1930. He served in the military from 1930 until 1964, and retired as a brigadier general in 1964.|$|E
5|$|On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres {{began and}} the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority {{operations}} to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units {{to operate with}} relative freedom. The Germans had adopted a defensive stratagem of massing their aircraft, now increasingly outnumbered, at critical points of the front. <b>Their</b> <b>units</b> were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|Shazly {{then went}} southward to 7th Division's {{bridgehead}} in Third Army's sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed {{him of the}} bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division's engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division's already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday's lull, the situation had not yet improved. This created complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with <b>their</b> <b>units</b> and consequently {{had no idea of}} their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned to {{the west bank of the}} canal to replenish their food and water supply.|$|E

5|$|The Marine {{attack on}} the morning of 27 September did not make much headway. Griffith's Raiders were unable to advance at the one-log bridge over the Matanikau, {{suffering}} several casualties, including the death of Major Kenneth D. Bailey and the wounding of Griffith. A flanking attempt by the Raiders further upstream also failed. The Japanese, who had reinforced <b>their</b> <b>units</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Matanikau during the night with additional companies from the 124th Infantry Regiment, repulsed the attacks by McDougal's men.|$|E
5|$|The Olympics were of {{fundamental}} religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias {{stood in his}} temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis. The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of <b>their</b> <b>units</b> of time measurement. The Games {{were part of a}} cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.|$|E

Critics praised the game's value for money and easy difficulty for novice gamers; however, many criticised the graphics and mechanics.|$|E
