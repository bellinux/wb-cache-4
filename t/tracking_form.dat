40|$|AbstractThe high {{incidence}} and prevalence of childhood obesity, coupled with significant morbidity and financial burden, clearly suggest {{the need for}} identification and implementation of effective pediatric obesity prevention strategies in primary care. A solution to this problem includes evidence based clinical guidelines that provide concise, culturally appropriate information on the identification and prevention of childhood obesity in primary care settings. The objective of this quality improvement project was to implement childhood obesity identification and prevention guidelines from evidence-based recommendations into practice. Guidelines were implemented during preventative care visits {{through the use of a}} <b>tracking</b> <b>form.</b> The development of the <b>tracking</b> <b>form</b> included input from practice staff resulting in increased fidelity. The <b>tracking</b> <b>form</b> included directions for clear and concise guideline implementation and provided opportunities to record patient BMI, nutritional intake, physical activity, familial obesity prevention education and motivational interviewing and facilitated a practice increase in childhood obesity identification and education. Presence of chart indicators, including nutrition and exercise history, were analyzed to determine the fidelity of the practice change in obesity identification and prevention education. Key outcomes included a significant (p < . 0001) practice increase in childhood obesity identification as well as a significant increase (p < . 05) in documentation of obesity prevention education through motivational interviewing. Practice change incorporating childhood obesity identification and familial prevention guidelines had positive effects in a pediatric population. Implementation of evidence-based guidelines can result in increased identification of children at risk for childhood obesity and enhanced familial obesity prevention education; leading to the long-term goal of creating healthier lifestyles and decreasing risk factors in a vulnerable population...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{narrative}} {{description of the}} journal article, document, or resource. This project studied the effects of implementing a computerized management information system developed for special education administrators. The Intelligent Administration Support Program (IASP), an expert system and database program, assisted in information acquisition and analysis pertaining to the district 2 ̆ 7 s quality of decisions and procedures {{in the process of}} student classification, placement, and the individual education plan (IEP). Output from the IASP was also used to support and monitor staff development activities. Assessment of baseline data from special education files of students who had been classified as learning disabled or intellectually handicapped revealed that existing school district interventions to reduce errors in student classification, placement, and the IEP process had been ineffective. A mentor team approach was established in four elementary schools using specially trained teachers to advise special education teachers in reviewing referrals for special education assessment. This approach resulted in reduced errors in assessments and decision making regarding students, compared to three secondary schools which did not use the mentor approach. Forms and samples of the IASP summary report, district intervention data, the classification <b>tracking</b> <b>form,</b> the classification consultation report, and corresponding graphs related to Chow statistics are appended.

40|$|International audienceLocalization, {{navigation}} and <b>tracking</b> <b>form</b> a special application domain of Bayesian filtering, where {{the position and}} velocity of a mobile (and possibly additional hyper-parameters) should be estimated based on (i) a prior model for the possible displacement of the mobile, (ii) noisy measurements provided by a sensor, and (iii) a georeferenced information source (digital map, reference data base, etc.), providing for each spatial position an estimate of the quantity measured by the sensor. For example in terrain-aided navigation (TAN) a radio-altimeter combined with an inertial navigation system (INS) provides an estimation of the terrain height below the platform, which can be correlated with the terrain height at each horizontal position, as read on a digital map. In wireless communications, the signal power received by the mobile from an access point (WiFi) or from a base station (GSM, UMTS) and measured by the mobile itself, can be correlated with another estimation of the signal power received at each spatial position, as read on a digital attenuation map or from a reference data base. Values read on a digital map are usually subject to errors which are in general spatially correlated and modeled as Gaussian random fields, with a known correlation function. This results in a temporal correlation of measurement noises, which should be accounted for in evaluating the likelihood function, an essential step in the derivation of the equation for the Bayesian filter...|$|E

This implication has greatly impacted the transportation field by creating a novel and rich source of traffic data on the road network. Although the promise offered by GPS devices to overcome problems like underreporting, respondent fatigue, inaccuracies and other human errors in data collection is significant; the technology is still relatively new that it raises many issues for potential users. These issues tend to revolve around the following areas: reliability, data processing and the related application. This thesis aims to study the GPS <b>tracking</b> <b>form</b> the methodological, technical and practical aspects. It first evaluates the reliability of GPS based traffic data {{based on data from}} an experiment containing three different traffic modes (car, bike and bus) traveling along the road network. It then outline the general procedure for processing GPS tracking data and discuss related issues that are uncovered by using real-world GPS tracking data of 316 cars. Thirdly, it investigates the influence of road network density in finding optimal location for enhancing travel efficiency and decreasing travel cost. The results show that the geographical positioning is reliable. Velocity is slightly underestimated, whereas altitude measurements are unreliable. Post processing techniques with auxiliary information is found necessary and important when solving the inaccuracy of GPS data. The densities of the road network influence the finding of optimal locations. The influence will stabilize at a certain level and do not deteriorate when the node density is higher...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{implement}} a screening program that would identify older adults with depressive symptoms. Data Sources: The Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is a baseline cognitive screen used to identify which depression screening tool {{should be used for}} the patient. The Geriatric Depression Scale- 15 is used to screen patients with a MMSE score of 19 or higher. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia is used for patients with a MMSE of 18 or below. Conclusions: This project had a small, convenience sample size (n= 17). All (n= 17) patients were given the cognitive screening. Due to inability to obtain consent, only 70 % (n= 12) were screened for depression. All 17 patients shared a total of five providers, who were contacted on two different occasions to notify them of the screening results and asked to complete the six-item survey. Two providers responded to the notification and completed the survey. Providers who completed the Likert survey strongly agreed that the depression treatment and tracking (DTT) form: (1) was helpful in documenting depression in the long-term care patients, (2) was easy to use, (3) decreased time spent per patient visit, and (4) was the one {{they would like to see}} used in the facility. Implications for Practice: Implementing a depression screening program through the use of a depression treatment and <b>tracking</b> <b>form</b> will assist staff with ease of documenting and communicating screening results to the patient’s primary care provider. The DTT form supports improved health outcomes for the long-term care patients by giving primary care providers a quick and easy-to-use form they can evaluate to determine if further evaluation and treatment is needed...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent {{public policy}} {{initiatives}} limiting or banning forms of distracted driving resultant from cellular phone use, crashes {{remain on the}} rise. Individuals from the millennial generation, ages 16 to 35, appear to be most susceptible to distracted driving. Understanding the behaviors, attitudes, and habits of millennials is critical to developing effective policy for behavior change. A dual task ethnographic study framed by Skinner 2 ̆ 7 s theory of behavior modification and Maslow 2 ̆ 7 s hierarchy of needs motivational model, was used to investigate to what extent millennials feel public policy has influenced their driving, and if additional policy initiatives are required to deter distracted driving behavior. Two phases of inquiry, first, naturalistic observation, and then focus group were conducted at a commuter university. Distracted driving behaviors including hand held cellular phone use, eating, drinking, and passenger interaction of 100 drivers entering or exiting campus were observed, tracked, and analyzed using a researcher-developed <b>tracking</b> <b>form.</b> Eighty-four percent exhibited at least one distracted driving behavior. After which, 12 enrolled and licensed students, aged 18 - 35, were recruited via social media for two focus group discussions. Focus group data were inductively coded and analyzed using semantical attribution analysis. The students revealed that millennial drivers felt distracted driving policy did not address behaviors they see as worthy of intervention, they did not perceive that cellular phone use while driving posed a significant threat, and they felt current law was difficult to enforce with penalties they regarded as non-prohibitive. Social change implications include improved distracted driving public policy, which may result in driving behavior changes and a potential reduction of death, injury, and property loss...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Fecal {{occult blood}} test {{screening}} in Canada is sub-optimal. Family physicians {{play a central}} role in screening and are limited by the time constraints of clinical practice. Patients face multiple barriers that further reduce completion rates. Tools that support family physicians in providing their patients with colorectal cancer information and that support uptake may prove useful. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a patient decision aid (nurse-managed telephone support line and/or colorectal cancer screening website) distributed by community-based family physicians, in improving colorectal cancer screening rates. Secondary objectives include evaluation of (dis) incentives to patient FOBT uptake and internet use among 50 to 74 year old males and females for health-related questions. Challenges faced by family physicians in engaging in collaborative partnerships with primary healthcare researchers will be documented. Methods/design A pragmatic, two-arm, randomized cluster controlled trial conducted in 22 community-based family practice clinics (36 clusters) with 76 fee-for-service family physicians in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Each physician will enroll 30 patients attending their periodic health examination and at average risk for colorectal cancer. All physicians will follow their standard clinical practice for screening. Intervention group physicians will provide a fridge magnet to each patient that contains information facilitating access to the study-specific colorectal cancer screening decision aids (telephone help-line and website). The primary endpoint is patient fecal occult blood test completion rate after four months (intention to treat model). Multi-level analysis will include clinic, physician and patient level variables. Patient Personal Health Identification Numbers will be collected from those providing consent to facilitate analysis of repeat screening behavior. Secondary outcome data will be obtained through the Clinic Characterization Form, Patient <b>Tracking</b> <b>Form,</b> In-Clinic Patient Survey, Post-Study Follow-Up Patient Survey, and Family Physician Survey. Study protocol approved by The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board. Discussion The study intervention has the potential to increase patient fecal occult blood test uptake, decrease colorectal cancer mortality and morbidity, and improve the health of Manitobans. If utilization of the website and/or telephone support line result in clinically significant increases in colorectal cancer screening uptake, changes in screening at the policy- and system-level may be warranted.

40|$|Following {{any type}} of disaster, public health and {{emergency}} management professionals {{must be prepared to}} respond to and {{meet the needs of the}} affected public. The Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER), also referred to as Rapid Need Assessment (RNA), Rapid Epidemiologic Assessment (REA), and Rapid Health Assessment (RHA), will assist public health practitioners and emergency management officials in determining the health status and basic needs of the affected community. Gathering information about health and basic need data by using valid statistical methods allows public health and emergency managers to prioritize their responses and to rationalize the distribution of resources. Without accurate information or uniform guidelines, public health officials may make decisions based on impressions or opinions, which may not accurately reflect the needs of the entire community. This toolkit was developed as a guideline for field staff in conducting CASPER. It provides quantitative post-disaster assessment procedures that can identify the health status and basic needs such as food, water, and shelter of the affected population. Personnel from any local, regional, state, or federal public health department, emergency management officials, academicians, or other disaster responders who need to assess household-level public health needs following a disaster may use this toolkit.
