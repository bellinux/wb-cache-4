25|$|The {{two teams}} traded {{touchdowns in the}} third quarter. Tulsa started the half with the ball and took over five minutes off the clock while driving 81yards down the field to score a touchdown. It didn't <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> for the Sooners. Oklahoma running back DeMarco Murray took the ensuing kickoff and {{returned}} it 81yards for the touchdown, and the Sooners shut down the Tulsa offense in the fourth quarter; Tulsa had four drives that combined for negative 12yards. Oklahoma brought in many of its backups in the fourth including backup quarterback Joey Halzle and fourth-string running back Mossis Madu. While Oklahoma did score three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, they only attempted two passes (both completions).|$|E
2500|$|It did not <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> - England's second innings lasted {{just under}} 46 overs. [...] Atherton and Stewart saw off Donald's opening spell, but then fell to De Villiers {{and the two}} back-up seamers. [...] Stewart managed to hold out for two hours for his 27, but Matthews took two wickets in two balls, and despite Gooch passing Viv Richards as the fourth-highest Test run scorer during his 28, nobody had answers to South Africa's bowlers. [...] The fieding was kept tight, {{and each of the}} bowlers chipped in with wickets as the batting {{collapsed}} and the tourists marched to a dominant victory.|$|E

5000|$|The {{result was}} the Eight Hour War of 1999, so named because it <b>took</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> for the Volgans to conquer the United Kingdom.

5000|$|Their second album, The Diamond in the Fish, {{released}} in 1996, was a concept album {{telling the story}} of a retired secret agent. The album was filled with Rat Pack-style jazz, filtered through folk and blues. About Diamond in the Fish, Wignall said, [...] "We were experimenting with idea of like playing jazz, which incidentally, we kinda sucked at.

6000|$|Edward Cossey {{drove from}} the Castle {{in a far}} from happy frame of mind. To begin with, the Squire and his condescending way of doing {{business}} irritated him very much, so much that once or twice {{in the course of the}} conversation he was within an ace of breaking the whole thing off, and only restrained himself with difficulty from doing so. As it was, notwithstanding all the sacrifices and money risks which he was undergoing to take up these mortgages, and they were very considerable even to a man of his great prospects, he felt that he had been placed in the position of a person who receives a favour rather than of a person who grants one. Moreover there was an assumption of superiority about the old man, a visible recognition of the gulf which used to be fixed between the gentleman of family and the man of business who has grown rich by trading in money and money's worth, which was the more galling because it was founded on actual fact, and Edward Cossey knew it. All his foibles and oddities notwithstanding, it would have been impossible for any person of discernment to entertain a comparison between the half-ruined Squire and the young banker, who would shortly be worth between half a million and a million sterling. The former was a representative, though a somewhat erratic one, of all that is best in the old type of Englishmen of gentle blood, which is now so rapidly vanishing, and of the class to which to a large extent this country owes her greatness. His very eccentricities were wandering lights that showed unsuspected heights and depths in his character--love of country and his country's honour, respect for the religion of his fathers, loyalty of mind and valour for the right. Had he lived in other times, like some of the old Boisseys and de la Molles, who were at Honham before him, he would probably have died in the Crusades or at Cressy, or perhaps more uselessly, for his King at Marston Moor, or like that last but one of the true de la Molles, kneeling in the courtyard of his Castle and defying his enemies to wring his secret from him. Now few such opportunities are left to men of his stamp, and they are, perhaps as a consequence, dying out of an age which is unsuited to them, and indeed to most strong growths of individual character. It would be much easier to deal with a gentleman like the Squire of this history if we could only reach down one of those suits of armour from the walls of his vestibule, and put it on his back, and <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> two-handled sword which last flashed on Flodden Field from its resting-place beneath the clock, and at the end see him die as a loyal knight should do in the forefront of his retainers, with the old war cry of [...] "/a Delamol--a Delamol/" [...] upon his lips. As it is, he is an aristocratic anachronism, an entity unfitted to deal with the elements of our advanced and in some ways emasculated age. His body should have been where his heart was--in the past. What chance have such as he against the Quests of this polite era of political economy and penny papers? ...|$|E

Edwards and the design team looked towards past monster characters from such films as Jurassic Park, Alien, Starship Troopers and King Kong for inspiration and reflected back on what made these monsters and their designs so iconic. From this, the design for the MUTO monsters kept evolving and [...] "mutating", according to Edwards, into a design he felt was more cohesive.|$|R

25|$|The {{project began}} with the {{building}} of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built {{so it could be}} larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the Western Wall tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as Josephus say <b>that</b> it <b>took</b> far longer, although the Temple itself may have <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> <b>long.</b> During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years.

5000|$|When {{one looks}} {{out into the}} night sky, {{distances}} also correspond to time into the past.

If one were to look at a galaxy ten billion light years away in one direction and another in the opposite direction, the total distance between them is twenty billion light years. This means that the light from the first has not yet reached the second, because the approximately 13.8 billion years that the [...] universe has existed is not a long enough time to allow it to occur.
