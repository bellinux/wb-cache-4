50|$|In {{an attempt}} to revive the KT26, Daniel Stewart, a {{footwear}} designer who {{had been involved in}} the 2012 Dunlop Volley International redevelopment project, began work on revised KT26 designs and a business case to relaunch this iconic running shoe. This was an 'after hours' project as there was no interest from Pacific Brands management to salvage the Dunlop Footwear business after the sale of the Volley brand. Stewart made contact with Jerry Stubberfield and key Dunlop footwear personnel from the 1980s and 1990s to uncover the history and heritage of the KT26 shoe. The 2012 revised KT26 design featured the original last shape and design elements from the OSAGA and first model KT26 shoes. The new shoe had a revised construction and materials. The mid sole was revised from an EVA wedge to an injection moulded pylon. However, the outsole featured a 3D concave shape and reduced lug pattern supposedly to improve impact absorption and grip to rival the performance of major brand running shoes. Unfortunately, the fundamental changes made to the design of the sole and tread pattern were not successful. The sole was no longer a hard wearing rubber and the tread pattern no longer featured wide deep lugs, resulting in reduced surface and edges in contact with the ground and was far inferior in grip in cold or wet conditions to the original KT26 sole. Contrary to the suggestion that the 3D concave outsole shape would improve impact absorption, the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> of sole was narrowed reducing traction, the spread of impact and causing dangerous foot rollover. The new shoe, while labeled KT26, did not have a KT26 sole and was an entirely different shoe.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Mathematics and Statistics) Tshwane University of TechnologyFor decades, the {{development}} of rhythmic corrugations on untarred roads has fascinated road engineers and technicians and even travellers. Numerous researchers have proposed theories about the formation and movement of these corrugations. Automobile tyres are essentially designed for use on tarred or concrete road surfaces. However, these tyres are also used on dirt roads, which often develop corrugations {{as a result of}} the interaction between the vehicle and dry road surfaces. Designing a tyre suited to corrugated dirt road conditions would be advantageous for rural inhabitants as well as the economy of a country. The aim of this research is to investigate the tangential oscillation of the vehicle tyre’s <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> when the tyre strikes an obstacle in the road and the effect of this tangential oscillation on the formation of corrugations. A theoretical analysis of the nature and frequency of the tangential oscillation of the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> of the rubber tyre was done. A mathematical model (torsional oscillator model) of the tangential oscillations of the rubber tyre’s <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> was proposed, in the form of an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. To verify this model, static experiments were performed on a wheel with a rigid, stationary axle. Dynamic experiments were then carried out on the tyre of a vehicle. It was found that, when a vehicle is travelling a corrugated dirt road and an obstacle (such as a corrugation) is struck in the road, the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> of the rubber tyre will oscillate tangentially. A second theoretical model, the forced telegraph equation model, in the form of a partial differential equation, was also proposed. Correlation between the graphs of the two models was evident. The experiments and observations in this research are consistent with the hypothesis that corrugations are formed, at least partially by the tangential oscillation of the vehicle tyre’s <b>tread</b> <b>surface.</b> It is suggested that, to minimize the formation of dirt road corrugations, the design of tyres must take into account the tangential oscillation of the rubber tyre’s <b>tread</b> <b>surface.</b> If the tangential oscillation of the tyres’ <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> can be effectively damped, their tendency to generate corrugations might be reduced...|$|E

40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{railroad}} wheels undergo high stresses due to dynamic or static loads continuously, flaws may {{be produced}} on the <b>tread</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{and they can}} lead to catastrophic failures of the wheels. In this study an EMAT system for inspecting every wheel of a train in a roll-by mode will be introduced. Two EMATs were installed in two shielding boxes separately for generating and receiving surface wave respectively. The boxes were designed for the EMAT {{to keep up the}} lift-off of 0. 2 mm over the entire surface. The system was able to observe at least 10 round-trips with the EMAT on an unflawed railroad wheel. Four flaws were made on a wheel surface to evaluate the flaw detectability of the system and the signal from the 3 mm deep notch showed good signal to noise ratio. Since the variations in the lift-off due to some factors such as dirt can be caused in rail yard usages, flaw signals were divided by the round-trip signal for the normalization. And a new algorithm to distinguish the flaw signal from abrupt noise was suggested...|$|R
30|$|Among surface {{modification}} processes, anodization (anodic oxidation) provides nanotextured features on metal oxides [5]. This process {{leads to the}} formation of protective TiO 2 nanostructures on the surface, which provides a natural environment for cell growth [5].

Topography of metal surface is easily changed by anodization [6]. In this way, bioactivity and biocompatibility of the underlying metal is enhanced. The absence of elicitation of inflammatory reactions of anodized <b>treaded</b> <b>surfaces</b> is also demonstrated previously [5]. Despite several advantages of anodized surfaces, this technique does not meet cost-benefit ratio measures due to the need for expensive platinum to serve as cathode within anodization process in nanoscales [7].

40|$|Diffuse {{ultrasonic}} backscatter measurements {{have been}} especially useful for extracting microstructural information and for improving flaw detection in materials. In this dissertation, this approach is applied to inspection of railroad wheels. To improve the wear resistance, the tread surfaces of railroad wheels are usually quenched with water to increase the hardness. The pearlite phase of iron, characterized by alternating ferrite and cementite phases, is created by the quenching and the lamellar spacing within grains increases progressively from the quenched <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> to deeper locations due to the non-uniform cooling rate. The quench depth is an important parameter governing the wheel performance. ^ In this dissertation, several aspects of ultrasonic methods are studied. A new singly-scattered response (SSR) model that includes lamellar duplex microstructure within grains is developed to investigate the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on such a microstructure in pearlitic wheel steel. An ultrasonic attenuation model is developed to study the influence of pearlite phase on ultrasonic attenuation. The experimental results show that both ultrasonic scattering amplitudes and longitudinal attenuation drop dramatically near the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> of a quenched wheel due {{to the presence of}} pearlite. The quench depth is measured by fitting the variance curve from the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> with the SSR model that includes the graded lamellar spacing on the propagation path. A mode-converted (longitudinal-to-transverse, or L-T) SSR model that includes duplex microstructure within grains is also developed to examine the preferred orientation of microstructure in a quenched sample. Finally, the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on stress is verified by observing the decrease of backscatter amplitudes measured from a 1018 steel block under a uniaxial load. The experimental results show a trend that is similar to the theoretical prediction. The residual stress in a quenched steel sample is estimated by quantifying the change of backscatter amplitudes with and without residual stress. ^ Diffuse ultrasonic backscatter techniques exhibit strong sensitivity to duplex microstructure, texture and stress, outcomes that can be applicable for quality control including microstructure evaluation, measurement of quench depth and residual stress. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Shattered rim cracking, {{propagation}} of a subsurface crack {{parallel to the}} tread sur-face, {{is one of the}} dominant railroad wheel failure types observed in North America. This crack initiation and propagation life depends on several factors, such as wheel rim thickness, wheel load, residual stresses in the rim, and the size and location of material defects in the rim. This article investigates the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on shattered rim cracking, using finite element analysis and fracture mechanics. This cracking is modelled using a three-dimensional, multiresolution, elastic–plastic finite element model of a railroad wheel. Material defects are modelled as mathematically sharp cracks. Rolling contact loading is simulated by applying the wheel load on the <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> over a Hertzian contact area. The equivalent stress intensity factor ranges at the subsurface crack tips are estimated using uni-modal stress intensity factors obtained from the finite element analysis and a mixed-mode crack growth model.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ground reaction force profiles and peak required coefficient of friction (RCOF) differed between young and elderly women or between stair ascent, stair descent and overground walking. While there was a trend towards less risky stair descent behaviour in the older women in terms of their peak RCOF values during stair descent, the increased vertical loading rate in the older women may imply reduced dynamic balance control. The largest mean RCOF peaks occurred during stair ascent in both young and older women, but there were several overground walking trials in both groups and a few stair descent trials of the young women, which resulted in RCOF peaks greater than 0. 5.

Furthermore, since long-term block braking may heat the wheel rim to over 500. °C, it is relevant to examine the high temperature performance of wheel material {{as well as the}} decrease in strength after thermal exposure. This work concerns the elevated temperature low cycle fatigue behaviour, and the deterioration of microstructure caused by pre-deformation and heat treatment. The materials examined are two similar medium carbon steels UIC ER 7 T and ER 8 T (~ 0. 55. wt% C), heat treated in regular wheel production to a near pearlitic microstructure with some 5 - 10 % pro-eutectoid ferrite in the wheel <b>tread</b> <b>surface.</b> For the study of microstructure deterioration, specimens were extracted from virgin wheels and pre-strained either monotonically to 6. 5 % strain or cyclically, to imitate plastic deformation developing in the wheel <b>tread</b> <b>surface</b> during operation.

Hardening due to strain ageing was observed around 300. °C while microstructure degradation caused softening at higher temperatures. Spheroidisation of the pearlite started to become visible at 450. °C for the un-deformed material and at around 400. °C for the pre-strained. The elevated temperature low cycle fatigue tests showed a similar increase in strength around 300. °C due to dynamic strain ageing, and decreasing strength at higher temperatures due to increased thermal activation and microstructure degradation.
