5|$|In 1972 <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> gained {{yet more}} {{military}} credentials when king penguin Nils Olav {{was adopted by}} the Norwegian King's Guard. Norway's connection with Edinburgh's penguins began with the Salvesen family's links to <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> and renewed interest was sparked when a lieutenant called Nils Egelien visited <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> with the King's Guard in 1961. On his return in 1972 Egelien arranged for the unit to adopt one of the penguins. Nils Olav was named after Egelien and in honour of King Olav V of Norway, and given the rank of lance corporal. A statue of the penguin now stands outside <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1997, then-zoo {{director}} Jeff Williamson merged some {{departments of}} <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> {{in a business}} move that was intended to provide a clearer direction for zoo operations. Many of the zoo's approximately 350 volunteers interpreted the merger as an elimination of volunteer training efforts. As a result, {{more than half of}} them left <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> by 1999.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the trails, <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> has several specialty attractions.|$|E
50|$|Colonies {{are kept}} in the West Midland Safari Park, <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Central Park <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Prospect Park <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Brookfield <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Bronx <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Moody Gardens Rainforest Pyramid, <b>the</b> San Diego <b>Zoo</b> Safari Park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, <b>the</b> Copenhagen <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Belfast <b>Zoo,</b> Curraghs Wildlife Park, Dublin Zoo, Paignton <b>Zoo</b> amongst others. <b>The</b> largest captive group is at Chester Zoo.|$|R

5000|$|Saito Center : The Saito Center {{is named}} after <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> former {{veterinarian}} who died shortly before construction of the building. Originally designed as a new winter holding building it now houses all <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> fragile animals. It is winter home to all of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> primate species as well. It {{is also home to}} the reptile and nocturnal wing, and many of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> smaller animals.|$|R
5|$|The Safari Train {{provides}} a nonstop {{guided tour of}} <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 forced <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> {{to close}} {{to protect the}} animals from {{possible}} infection. Since <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> could not welcome any visitors, it faced significant financial losses. Questions were posed about the zoo's future, though {{in the end the}} park was able to reopen after only five weeks. Further help {{came in the form of}} a Â£1.9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of the city in early April, just as <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> reopened.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> {{presents}} three themed exhibition venues, each {{housed in}} a dedicated building.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, for <b>the</b> Hogle <b>Zoo's</b> fiftieth anniversary, <b>the</b> Animal Giants Complex {{was built}}. The exhibit {{was built to}} house <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> elephants,Dari, Kali, Twiggy, Toni, and Toka, and <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> white rhinos, Princess and George. Naturalistic outdoor {{enclosures}} were not only built for <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> pachyderms but for ostriches and tortoises too. The Animal Giants Complex was renovated for Elephant Encounter which opened in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum has}} the largest {{collection}} of different species of live rattlesnakes in the world, which are presented in recreated habitats, and claims to host more rattlesnake species than <b>the</b> Bronx <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Zoo</b> in Washington, D.C., <b>the</b> Denver <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco <b>Zoo,</b> and <b>the</b> San Diego <b>Zoo</b> combined.

50|$|Walkin' the Tracks holds <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> North American animals, {{including}} {{prairie dogs}} and white-tailed deer. The Cougar Express has indoor viewing in a train car for <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> cougars.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning at <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> as of March 2010.|$|E
5|$|A Phoenix {{municipal}} bond election in March 2006 provided $2 {{million to the}} project, marking the first time <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> has received public funds in its history. On 8 June 2006, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson announced a major fund-raising drive over the next 10 years to update the zoo's infrastructure {{and many of its}} aging exhibits. <b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> needs to raise $70 million to complete the project. In 2009, a shorter term goal is to raise $20 million by 2012 to pay for a number of improvements that are already under way.|$|E
5|$|After Tom Gillespie retired, Gilbert D. Fisher was {{appointed}} director-secretary of <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> in 1956. He held the post till {{he retired in}} 1971.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 1985, {{two female}} Amur tigers killed 24-year-old animal keeper Robin Silverman after she entered their {{enclosure}} with a volunteer aide. It was unclear why Silverman entered <b>the</b> enclosure; <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> general curator suspected a lapse in Silverman's concentration, while Silverman's family suspected a lapse {{on the part}} of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's.</b> It was <b>the</b> first fatality in <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> history.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Nosey the Elephant's habitat was renovated {{and three}} new {{elephants}} were brought in. A red wolf exhibit known as Wolf Woods was added in 1984, and the Doris and Karl Falk Wildlife Education Center was completed {{and became the}} backbone of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> Educational Center. In 1985, <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> name changed from <b>the</b> Roeding Park <b>Zoo</b> to <b>the</b> Fresno <b>Zoo.</b> In 1988, <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> walk-through rainforest exhibit was added. 1989 saw {{the addition of a}} large classroom wing, and the implementation of the Adopt-an-Animal fundraising program.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 the Harold Simmons Foundation made a {{donation}} of $5 million to <b>the</b> Dallas <b>Zoo,</b> <b>the</b> largest single private contribution in <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> 120-year history.|$|R
5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. <b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where they were never properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo was {{the first}} zoo {{in the world to}} house and to breed penguins. It is also the only zoo in Britain to house koalas and giant pandas. <b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> {{is a member of the}} British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), and the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions. It has also been granted four stars by the Scottish Tourism Board. <b>The</b> <b>zoo</b> gardens boast one of the most diverse tree {{collections}} in the Lothians.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987 the new {{orangutan}} exhibit opened (currently part of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> Orangutan Trail), {{which now}} holds one of <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> two present Bornean orangutan groups, and zoo visitors {{began to rise}} again. At the time, it was <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> most impressive and costly ever exhibit designed to be moated and barless. However, a much more spectacular short term exhibit was being investigated.|$|R
50|$|The Temperate Zone {{features}} {{animals from}} temperate zones around <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>zoo's</b> nine-banded armadillos Kirby and Penny. <b>The</b> <b>zoo's</b> rare three black-footed cats and cape hyrax {{can also be}} found in the Temperate Zone. <b>The</b> <b>zoo's</b> Siamese crocodiles Hillary and Bill live in the Temperate Zone during the winter. Other reptiles found in the temperate Hall include a Madagascar tree boa, crested geckos, and Madagascar flat-tailed tortoises.|$|R

5|$|Gillespie {{retired from}} his post as {{director}} in 1950. In 1956 he was succeeded by Gilbert Fisher, who took over as director-secretary of the Zoological Society and effectively gained control of <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iles {{remained}} as superintendent until 1957, and {{proved to be}} a good publicist for <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> taking part in radio and television programmes such as Children's Hour. A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a Chimps' Tea Party, which proved to be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but by then the owners of Belle Vue had lost interest in <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> and closure seemed imminent.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis escaped from <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> {{and went on}} the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Continuity of Life Forms is {{a mosaic}} by Portland {{architect}} and artist Willard Martin.
