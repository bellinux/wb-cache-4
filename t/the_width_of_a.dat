The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E

25|$|The tracker {{needs to}} record {{particle}} paths accurately yet be lightweight {{so as to}} disturb the particle as little as possible.

It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.|$|E

In {{order to}} develop a useful {{theoretical}} framework on interval number like real number theory, Hukuhara [23] introduced another concept of interval difference for a and b in 1967, namely the Hukuhara difference (H-difference, a b), where a b=c {{if and only if}} a=b+c. However, although such a concept can satisfy a a= 0, a b is meaningful only when w(a)> w(b), where w(a) and w(b) denote <b>the</b> <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> and b, respectively. In order to overcome one such fault, after Markov [24] pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> a-b was equal to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> and b, he gave the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonstandard subtraction expressed also by the symbol <b>of</b> ‘−’. Such <b>a</b> concept can guarantee that a-a= 0, and <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval a-b equals the absolute value of <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> and b. Thereafter, Stefanini [9, 27 – 29] extended the version of the H-difference to the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> generalized Hukuhara difference (gH-difference, a_gb) which coincided with the nonstandard subtraction operator introduced in Markov [24], Definition  1, p. 326. Such a gH-difference has been comprehensively adopted to investigate interval dynamic systems, because apart from still satisfying a_ga= 0, the gH-difference always exists for any two intervals. Thus, it is an invaluable mathematical concept in probing interval number theory. In our last work [30], some fundamental arithmetic rules on interval numbers, based on the conventional addition and gH-difference were extended to the case of interval-valued vectors, while some properties, in particular associative and distributive laws, were obtained.|$|R
