5|$|The Giant Dipper {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains with six cars per train. Riders are arranged two across in two rows {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. The trains were built by Dana Morgan from D.H. Morgan Manufacturing. When the Giant Dipper opened, it ran with three trains, each with ten cars. Over time, the trains have been redesigned several times with changes to the restraint system. However, they are almost unchanged since <b>they</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> trains have changed colors several times since the ride opened.|$|E
5|$|Two bascule bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced {{the free}} ferries in 1923, and {{are of a}} type {{patented}} by Joseph B. Strauss, {{who went on to}} design the Golden Gate Bridge. Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before <b>they</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> larger Carquinez Bridge to the west. The counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.|$|E
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when <b>they</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{considerable}} {{opposition to}} his plan from John Considine, who controlled all three gaming operations in town. Although gambling was illegal, Considine {{had worked out}} an agreement with Police Chief C.S. Reed. Earp partnered with an established local gambler named Thomas Urguhart, and <b>they</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Union Club saloon and gambling operation in Seattle's Pioneer Square. The Seattle Star noted two weeks later that Earp's saloon was earning a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. On March 23, 1900, the state of Washington filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club's furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but {{within a couple of}} months, Wyatt and Josephine returned to Oregon and caught the SS Alliance for Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. <b>They</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> first facility of the library at {{what is now the}} Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site.|$|E

After Dee Milliner blocked a Devon Bell field goal attempt, the Crimson Tide took possession and six plays later led 14–0 on a 57-yard AJ McCarron touchdown pass to Kenny Bell. The Alabama defense then forced their first punt of the game, and {{for the third time in}} three possessions the Crimson Tide scored a touchdown on a nine-yard McCarron pass to Michael Williams for a 21–0 lead. Each team then traded three-and-outs until nearly the end of the second quarter when Alabama was able to convert a 34-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal for a 24–0 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{chances of}} winning a third {{successive}} European Cup were ended with defeat to Nottingham Forest in the First Round. However <b>they</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> league campaign with six straight wins and dominated the league by finishing eight points clear of second-placed Forest, scoring 85 goals and conceding just 16 in the process. His goal against Derby County on 24 February won him Match of the Days Goal of the Season award. Writing in his autobiography, Paisley named the 1978–79 team as the best championship team he had been associated with during his 40 years with the club. Manchester United again denied them the {{chance to win the}} Double however, as United knocked Liverpool out of the semi-finals of the FA Cup following a replay at Goodison Park. Liverpool also lost the 1978 European Super Cup, following a 4–3 aggregate defeat to Anderlecht.|$|E

5|$|The Epirote {{successes in}} Macedonia worried the Latins, as <b>they</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way to another attack on Thessalonica.

Interrupting a campaign against the Nicaeans in Asia Minor, Henry of Flanders hastened to Thessalonica. He took up contact with Boril and was preparing to march against Theodore when he suddenly died on 11 June 1216, probably of malaria, although poisoning by his second wife Maria of Bulgaria has also been suggested. The death of the warlike Henry, followed by that of Pope Innocent III, the instigator of the Fourth Crusade, a month later, was a major stroke of good fortune for Theodore as it removed two of his most eminent and capable opponents.|$|E
