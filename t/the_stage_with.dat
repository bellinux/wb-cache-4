5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} {{room and a}} gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages. In each stage, players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>with</b> more rooms becoming accessible as each stage is completed. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a flashlight and two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E

5|$|In {{the leading}} group, Pate {{made the first}} attack on the {{unclassified}} climb on the finishing circuit, but Brändle covered the move and passed him. Brändle was then able to hold off the chase of Keisse– the faster sprinter– and finished <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> a four-second advantage. Van Meirhaeghe finished third with Pate fourth. In the peloton, Peter Sagan won the bunch sprint, over a minute behind Brändle.|$|E
5|$|June 16, 1980, {{marked the}} theater’s rebirth {{and a new}} chapter in Seattle’s arts community. At the Grand Opening Gala for the renovated theatre, actress Helen Hayes christened <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> a kiss and {{declared}} the 5th “a national treasure.” Beginning on July 3 the 5th presented Annie, the first touring Broadway musical to appear at the theatre.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes the sanctity of <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>with</b> its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.|$|E
5|$|Other critics view Motörhead as {{the first}} {{significant}} exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Morrison has {{typically}} {{been supportive}} of other artists, often willingly sharing <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> them during his concerts. On the live album, A Night in San Francisco, he had as his special guests, among others, his childhood idols: Jimmy Witherspoon, John Lee Hooker and Junior Wells. Although he often expresses his displeasure (in interviews and songs) {{with the music}} industry and the media in general, he {{has been instrumental in}} promoting the careers of many other musicians and singers, such as James Hunter, and fellow Belfast-born brothers, Brian and Bap Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E
5|$|Shabazz {{was in the}} {{audience}} near <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> her daughters. When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and MalcolmX's associates used a stretcher to carry him up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|The Wonder World Tour {{has been}} {{described}} as part of Cyrus' transitional period, with more elaborate and edgier characteristics. Each concert was divided into seven segments, each of which bared different themes, the subject of matter for the tour's title. The show opened with Cyrus performing rock-oriented songs. It also featured her and backup dancers being suspended above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> aerial rigging various times. At one point, she mounted a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as it was elevated and made its path across the venue. Cyrus also rendered a tribute to the deceased singer Michael Jackson and performed two Hannah Montana-credited songs as herself.|$|E

50|$|Despres however lost 17 {{minutes to}} stage winner Barreda during <b>the</b> fourth <b>stage,</b> handing <b>the</b> lead to Yamaha's Olivier Pain. The young French rider held the lead {{until the end}} of <b>the</b> seventh <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> some {{consistent}} <b>stage</b> times, but hit trouble during <b>the</b> eighth <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> a navigational error. This would mean Pain's teammate David Casteu, who won <b>the</b> fifth <b>stage,</b> headed into <b>the</b> rest day as leader of the overall standings.|$|R
5|$|The {{calculation}} of the general classification changed from the previous editions of the race, shifting to a team-based event, with each team only allowed four riders. Points were awarded to teams based upon winning the stage, having multiple riders in the top four places in each stage, and finishing <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> {{a minimum of three}} riders. A total of fourteen teams participated, with 56 riders registering and 54 officially starting the race.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way that}} facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E
5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>with</b> a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, Kapoor {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> six other Bollywood celebrities in the successful Rockstars Concert world tour. The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed {{due to the}} arrest of Salman Khan. It later began the following month and was staged in 19 cities across the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan's Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, Katrina Kaif, Ganesh Hegde, Javed Ali and Anusha Dandekar) debuted at the Ahoy Rotterdam venue in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Several months later she again joined Khan, Rampal and Kaif to perform for an audience of 15,000 at Dubai's Festival City Arena.|$|E
5|$|In 1747, Fleetwood's playhouse patent expired. The theatre and {{a patent}} renewal were {{purchased}} by actor David Garrick (who had trained under Macklin earlier) and partner James Lacy. Garrick served as manager and lead actor of the theatre until roughly 1766, {{and continued on}} in the management role for another ten years after that. He is remembered {{as one of the}} great stage actors and is especially associated with advancing the Shakespearean tradition in English theatre – during his time at Drury Lane, the company mounted at least 24 of Shakespeare's plays. Some of Shakespeare's surge in popularity during this period can be traced to the Licensing Act of 1737, which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a vacuum of new material to perform. Garrick shared <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> company including Peg Woffington, Susannah Cibber, Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, Spranger Barry, Richard Yates and Ned Shuter. It was under Garrick's management that spectators were for the first time barred from the stage itself.|$|E

It took place at two outdoor venues, Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park, with over 100,000spectators. Zinta's largest world tour was in 2004, when she joined a group of stars (Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra) in the Temptation 2004 tour. Showcased in over 22countries across the world, it became Bollywood's most {{prominent}} international concert. In 2006, Zinta {{was part of the}} Heat 2006 world tour, along with Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Sushmita Sen and Celina Jaitley. The Unforgettable Tour (2008) saw Zinta performing with the Bachchan family and Ritesh Deshmukh in a 40-day show staged in 11 cities across North America, Europe and the Caribbean. In December 2012, Zinta returned to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>with</b> the Temptation Reloaded concert in Jakarta (joined by Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu).|$|E
