5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine should be able <b>to</b> <b>oxidise</b> water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid.

Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E

40|$|We {{and others}} have {{observed}} that substrates for copper-containing amine oxidases cause substrate inhibition at high concentrations. Through use of a novel ‘‘pseudoquantitative’’ rapid equilibrium approach, kinetic analyses with human and bovine enzymes indicate that these effects are consistent with substrates binding <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> and reduced enzyme forms. Small cations compete with binding of substrates <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> and reduced enzyme, influencing both substrate turnover and substrate inhibition patterns. Cations reduce affinity of the resting bovine enzyme for spermidine, but not benzylamine, indicating that the predominant effect of cations on substrate oxidation results from binding to an anionic site outside the active site. However, binding of cations to the active site of the reduced form of both enzymes attenuates substrate inhibition with both spermidine and benzylamine. Our observations have significant practical implications for researchers assaying kinetic behaviour of these enzymes, and particularly those developing novel inhibitors of human copper-containing amine oxidases...|$|R

500|$|Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is an {{unstable}} yellow solid that decomposes above −28°C. It is thus little-known. It {{is difficult to}} produce because fluorine gas would tend <b>to</b> <b>oxidise</b> iodine {{all the way to}} the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with xenon difluoride is necessary. Iodine trichloride, which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I2Cl6, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at −80°C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid iodine trichloride conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to [...] and [...] ions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> intermediates <b>to</b> generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|R

40|$|Our aim was {{to define}} any effects of {{confirmed}} garlic supplementation on the resistance of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation, on LDL sub-fraction composition including levels of lipoprotein(a), and on levels of circulating antibody <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> LDL, variables of interest in relation to cardiovascular risk. Additional tests were performed on samples collected from a double blind, randomised 6 -month parallel trial in which 900 mg Kwai garlic or placebo was taken by moderately hypercholesterolaemic volunteers. Final data was analysed for 20 garlic and 11 placebo subjects with compliance of at least 75 % as determined by repeat tablet counting. EDTA plasma stabilised by sucrose was stored at - 70 degrees C for up to 12 months. Lipids and apolipoproteins were determined by standard methods, lipoprotein(a) by an ELISA method and LDL fraction composition by non-gradient gel electrophoresis. Oxidative resistance of LDL purified after isolation by density gradient centrifugation was assessed from oxidative resistance to copper ions determined spectrophotometrically, antibodies <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> LDL were determined by a microtitre plate assay and vitamin E content of plasma by HPLC. Overall lipid/lipoprotein profiles including lipoprotein(a) were unchanged as with the parent group. LDL composition showed a trend to less dense material in both placebo and garlic groups, all differences not significant. Lag time as a marker of oxidative resistance also increased in both groups, without change in vitamin E content, all differences not significant and consistent with a placebo effect. Levels of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>oxidised</b> LDL were unchanged. The {{results of this study}} do not support the hypothesis that dietary garlic supplementation decreases the susceptibility of isolated LDL to oxidation and that patterns of LDL tractions in plasma might be involved. Levels of lipoprotein(a) in plasma were also not changed. Other mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit are however not excluded...|$|R
500|$|At room temperature, {{bromine trifluoride}} (BrF3) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by {{directly}} fluorinating bromine {{at room temperature}} and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than chlorine trifluoride. It reacts vigorously with boron, carbon, silicon, arsenic, antimony, iodine, and sulfur to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, it is used <b>to</b> <b>oxidise</b> uranium to uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF4 and BrF2SbF6 remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form [...] and [...] and thus conducts electricity.|$|E
500|$|Ruthenium can be {{oxidized}} to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, {{oxidation state}} +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide. Like osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide {{is a potent}} fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples. [...] Dipotassium ruthenate (K2RuO4, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO4, +7) are also known. Unlike osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent <b>to</b> <b>oxidise</b> dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate (...) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100°C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states. Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides only when reacted directly with the chalcogens, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure and thus must contain ruthenium(II).|$|E
500|$|Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a {{volatile}} colourless molecular liquid which melts at −76.3°C and boils at 11.8°C. It may be formed by directly fluorinating gaseous chlorine or chlorine monofluoride at 200–300°C. It {{is one of}} the most reactive known chemical compounds, reacting with many substances which in ordinary circumstances would be considered chemically inert, such as asbestos, concrete, and sand. It explodes on contact with water and most organic substances. The list of elements it sets on fire is diverse, containing hydrogen, potassium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, bromine, iodine, and powdered molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, iridium, and iron. An impermeable fluoride layer is formed by sodium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, tin, and silver, which may be removed by heating. When heated, even such noble metals as palladium, platinum, and gold are attacked and even the noble gases xenon and radon do not escape fluorination. Nickel containers are usually used due to that metal's great resistance to attack by chlorine trifluoride, stemming from the formation of an unreactive nickel fluoride layer. Its reaction with hydrazine to form hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen, and chlorine gases was used in experimental rocket motors, but has problems largely stemming from its extreme hypergolicity resulting in ignition without any measurable delay. For these reasons, it was used in bomb attacks during the Second World War by the Nazis. Today, it is mostly used in nuclear fuel processing, <b>to</b> <b>oxidise</b> uranium to uranium hexafluoride for its enriching and to separate it from plutonium. It can act as a fluoride ion donor or acceptor (Lewis base or acid), although it does not dissociate appreciably into [...] and [...] ions.|$|E

2500|$|It wasn't until 1944 {{that the}} railway changed the {{standard}} livery to Indian red {{which is a}} rusty, orange colour, akin to red lead paint.

[...] This was very similar to London and North Eastern Railway apple green. The story goes that the Rev. Teddy Boston, a friend of the Marquess had a model of an Isle of Man locomotive that he had painted in LNER colours. [...] This was shown to Ailsa in the spring of 1967, who liked it, and had 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 15 quickly repainted to match! [...] Spring green became standard livery until nationalization, when the new Isle of Man Railways management decided to repaint the locomotives in a variety of colours to dispel the notion that there were only two engines on the line. [...] The first so treated was No.4 Loch which appeared in a non-standard Midland Red livery for the 1979 season. [...] Two years later No. 11 Maitland appeared in a variation on the Indian red scheme, though she briefly ran in a dull black livery after being used for the BBC production of 'The Ginger Tree' in the late 1980s. [...] There then followed by the most bizarre incarnation of them all, a royal blue No. 12 Hutchinson complete with alleged [...] "Mannin-Style" [...] square cab.

[...] No. 13 Kissack appeared in Brunswick green c.1980, and remained in that livery until withdrawn in 1992. [...] When G H Wood re-entered service in 1993 she took over from Kissack as the dark green locomotive, whilst Sunderland was out-shopped in spring green for the 1998 season.|$|E
