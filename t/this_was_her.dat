5|$|On December 15, 1917, Major married H. Binga Dismond in a {{military}} ceremony at Camp Logan in Houston. They were divorced in 1933 but remained cordial. In 1942 she married musician Gilbert Holland, a baritone whose voice was heard frequently on radio programs of the 1930s. Her last marriage was to a prominent mortician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, John Richard Major. The ceremony took place in Buenos Aires during a trip they took to South America, probably in 1946. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> third marriage and his fourth. She was widowed by 1953 and did not remarry during the remaining three decades of her life.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Channel in April 1807, Gibraltar {{joined the}} fleet under Admiral James Gambier, which fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> last major action; {{the ship was}} taken out of service in 1813 and {{converted}} to a powder hulk. She became a lazarette in 1824, then was broken up in November 1836 at Pembroke Dock.|$|E
5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on {{a more active role in}} the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much of a role as she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E

The prospect of a quick trading arrangement was downplayed by both leaders in 2012; nevertheless, Gillard's efforts in brokering the deal was a precursor of the agreement being finalised between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in 2014. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> second trip to India whilst in Government; on 31 August 2009, Gillard, then–deputy prime minister, met in India with Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal {{for the purpose of}} discussing the Australian Government's response to the string of attacks on Indian people living in Australia and attending Australian educational institutions.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979, when Gaven {{was twenty}} years old, {{she served as}} the {{replacement}} actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production of Grease. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> Broadway debut.

In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of Oliver! at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of Zorba, Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being held responsible for the suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her.

5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
