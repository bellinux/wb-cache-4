40|$|A key {{application}} of sensor networks in smart environments is in monitoring activi-ties of people. We develop several scenarios in which ultrasonic sensors {{are used for}} patient and elderly monitoring. In each scenario, we apply different algorithms for data fusion and sensor selection using quality-based or time division approaches. We have devised trajectory-matching algorithms to classify trajectories of move-ment of people in indoor environments. The trajectories are divided into several routine classes and the current trajectory is compared against the known routine <b>trajectories.</b> The <b>initial</b> <b>results</b> are quite promising, and show the potential usability of ultrasonic sensors in monitoring indoor movements of people, and in capturing and classifying trajectories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the affect of round-off error in the {{accurate}} simulation of translu-nar trajectories. The three-body dynamics can be posed in either an Earth-centered (EC) or Moon-centered frame. In this study, multiple translunar trajectories were simulated {{to determine if there}} is an optimal switch point from an EC to MC frame that minimize round-off error. A high fidelity baseline simulation was first created, and the entire trajectory was propagated in EC. Comparison trajectories were then simulated at lower precision, and the trajectory was propagated first in EC, then switched to MC at varying points in the <b>trajectory.</b> From <b>initial</b> <b>results,</b> the optimal switching can reduce round-off error by more than 50 %, and the optimal switch point appears to correspond closely to the Moon’s sphere of influence...|$|R
40|$|Animators {{working with}} 3 D models and data {{typically}} are still bound to 2 D interaction. We present a new multimodal interface for editing 3 D motion data using a haptic device. In the basic mode, the haptic device guides {{the hand of}} the user along a trajectory that was previously recorded or specified. Any significant deviation from the <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> instantly <b>results</b> in permanent changes made to this trajectory. This interface provides a simple, intuitive method for the user to actually experience movement other than visually for purposes of creation.

40|$|Abstract—Estimation {{of model}} {{parameters}} in a dynamic sys-tem can be significantly improved {{with the choice}} of experimental trajectory. For general, nonlinear dynamic systems, finding glob-ally “best ” trajectories is typically not feasible; however, given an initial estimate of the model parameters and an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory,</b> we present a continuous-time optimization method that produces a locally optimal trajectory for parameter estimation {{in the presence of}} measurement noise. The optimization algorithm is formulated to find system trajectories that improve a norm on the Fisher information matrix. A double-pendulum cart apparatus is used to numerically and experimentally validate this technique. In simulation, the optimized trajectory increases the minimum eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix by three orders of magnitude compared to the <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Experimental <b>results</b> show that this optimized trajectory translates to an order of magnitude improvement in the parameter estimate error in practice.

40|$|Here {{we propose}} a cone-beam composite-circling mode {{to solve the}} quasi-short object problem, which is to {{reconstruct}} a short portion of a long object from longitudinally truncated cone-beam data involving the short object. In contrast to the saddle curve cone-beam scanning, the proposed scanning mode requires that the X-ray focal spot undergoes a circular motion in a plane facing the short object, while the X-ray source is rotated in the gantry main plane. Because of the symmetry of the proposed mechanical rotations and the compatibility with the physiological conditions, this new mode has significant advantages over the saddle curve from perspectives of both engineering implementation and clinical applications. As a feasibility study, a backprojection filtration (BPF) algorithm is developed to reconstruct images from data collected along a composite-circling <b>trajectory.</b> The <b>initial</b> simulation <b>results</b> demonstrate the correctness of the proposed exact reconstruction method and {{the merits of the}} proposed mode.

40|$|Price and {{quantity}} competition are compared in the dynamic game {{framework of a}} nonrenewable natural resource duopoly. It is shown that a price-decision-rule (quantity-decision-rule) strategy dominates, {{in terms of a}} higher present value of the initial resource stocks, if the resources are complements (substitutes). This result is shown to hold for subgame-perfect equilibria. It holds although equilibrium price paths resulting from those two types of strategies will cross. It is shown, however, that even though the price <b>trajectories</b> cross, <b>initial</b> equilibrium prices <b>resulting</b> from the price-rule strategy will be lower than the <b>initial</b> equilibrium prices <b>resulting</b> from the quantity-rule strategy.
