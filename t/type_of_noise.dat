25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give our students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} effect <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{on performance}} <b>of</b> significant image compression formats.

This examination {{is based on}} results of experiments with images, which are intentionally degraded by noise, then compressed to examined formats and compared with result of experiments for original images without <b>noise.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> on performance <b>of</b> comparised formats is based on image quality metric SSIM.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{expressive}} {{speech of}} Thai had been studied {{for a short}} period of time. An important feature of speech was fundamental frequency (F 0) which defines the human speech prosody. It could be used to distinguish the difference between several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> expressive speech. The environmental noises affect the F 0 contour for Thai dialects as concluded in the previous study. The study prosodic information of Thai speech with various speaking styles and several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> had not been conducted. Approach: Four different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> speaking styles were used; meanwhile four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> environmental <b>noises</b> were recorded with different levels of power. They were subsequently mixed together. The F 0 contours from different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> speaking styles, different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> and different levels <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were extracted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the F 0 contour of clean speech and the noise-corrupted speech was calculated. Results: In the experiments, four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were included train, factory, car and air conditioner. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> speaking style included 10 samples of 10 utterances of male and female speech. Five levels <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were varied from 0 - 20 dB compared with the clean speech. It could be notified that the effects <b>of</b> distinguishing <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noises</b> were different. Four different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> speaking styles were also caused the differences in RMSEs. Conclusion: The recorded noises deteriorate the F 0 contours for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> speaking styles in Thai...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in the {{simultaneous}} interpreting process, using the concept <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{as defined in}} information theory and the model of communication developed by Claude Shannon. The theoretical section of this thesis first offers a brief explanation of the basic concepts involved in information theory, followed by a description of Shannon's model. Selected models of interpreting are then introduced based on this model of communication. A list <b>of</b> potential <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> is then presented based on the literature examined that may {{have an impact on}} the interpreter during simultaneous interpreting. The empirical section of this thesis consists of a questionnaire and an experiment. The questionnaire determines to what extent interpreters find the potential <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> from the list created in the theoretical section disruptive in their work. The list <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> is also expanded based on respondents' answers.

40|$|We derive the {{ultimate}} bounds {{on the performance}} of nonlinear measurement schemes in the presence <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> In particular, we investigate the precision of the second-order estimation scheme {{in the presence of the}} two most detrimental <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> photon loss and phase diffusion. We find that the second-order estimation scheme is affected by both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in an analogous way as the linear one. Moreover, we observe that for both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> the gain in the phase sensitivity with respect to the linear estimation scheme is given by a multiplicative term O(1 /N).
