5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. <b>The</b> <b>mass</b> of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of the fused product is less than <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of the atom. <b>The</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring {{the intensity of the}} different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

5|$|Aries {{contains}} several {{stars with}} extrasolar planets. HIP 14810, a G5 type star, is orbited by three giant planets (those {{more than ten}} times <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of Earth).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} rethinks some of {{the core}} arguments of the Western theories of <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> By demonstrating <b>the</b> inapplicability of these theories in {{the situation of the}} Twentieth Century totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia, this study argues for a replacement of the dominant paradigms with new theories of <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> relevant to <b>the</b> specific historical and social conditions. History of <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> in communist Czechoslovakia shows that <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> were not viewed as an inherently destructive social element. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> functioned as supportive social structures for the oppressive regime, but also as the expressions of the nascent democratic civic interaction that later challenged this regime...|$|R

5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the relative atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E

40|$|Democracy simply put, is the {{government}} of “the people”. There {{is no doubt that}} the rise of “the people” is now a principal political force in our contemporary world. Though democracy is largely celebrated today, Ortega y Gasset, in his book Revolt of <b>the</b> <b>Masses</b> thinks that it is an unfortunate incident. For him, <b>the</b> <b>masses,</b> regrettably, are vulgar. <b>The</b> <b>masses</b> are drunken by the possibilities that contemporary science has made feasible on one hand.

This absence of knowledge endangers the masses’ progress with negative potential outcomes, but they want to lead, rule and involve in government. The “revolt of the masses” is simply a rebellion of hysteria against reason in human activities. This paper attempts to look critically at Otega’s Revolt of <b>the</b> <b>Masses</b> and democracy.

40|$|With new, smaller {{distances}} of the Cepheids, as determined recently by Schmidt (1984) and by Bohm-Vitense (1985), smaller pulsational masses are obtained than previously.
