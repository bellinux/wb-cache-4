5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale (2006) is {{the twenty-first}} spy {{film in the}} Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen {{adaptation}} of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, {{it is the first}} film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, and was produced by Eon Productions for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, making it the first Eon-produced Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio. Following Die Another Day, Eon Productions decided to reboot the film series, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film, with the first film of the reboot allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond than in previous entries.|$|E
5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E

5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

25|$|Actual bias is the {{influence}} of partiality and prejudice in decision-making, and actual prejudice against or in favour of a party. It must be proved on a balance of probabilities.

25|$|However, {{there are}} {{exceptions}} to the rule, such as conversions {{for the sake of}} adoptions always being permitted. Additionally, communal rabbis (such as the late Chief Rabbi Jacob S. Kassin) have occasionally recognized conversions carried out by certain rabbis, such as members of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Nonetheless, these rulings strongly discourage people from converting into the Syrian Jewish community as they require <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> commitment to Judaism above and beyond what is required by the normative rabbinical laws of conversion.|$|E

25|$|Straczynski had {{prepared}} a five-year series. But {{a change in}} personnel in Showtime's administration caused the network to decide to stop producing science fiction programming and unofficially cancel Jeremiah before the second season had its debut in November 2003. Fans realized the possibility of cancellation when Showtime announced the airing of only the first seven out of fifteen episodes of the second season, and organized a campaign to write and phone executives at Showtime, MGM and Platinum Studios to convince <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the remaining eight and continue with a third season. Ultimately, the network began airing the remaining of the second season starting on September 3, 2004 - after a ten-month break since the last aired episode - but despite continuously rising ratings did not proceed with the renewal of the show.|$|E
25|$|Later, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert {{announced}} that their respective shows, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, would also return without writers on January 7, 2008. The WGA accused Comedy Central and NBC of forcing hosts back on air by threatening {{the jobs of}} the staff and crew of their shows, {{and said it would}} picket <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> <b>show</b> respect to the writers, The Daily Show was renamed, {{for the duration of the}} strike, A Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Similarly, The Colbert Report was rebranded as The Colbert Report (with hard T's) for its first new episode since the strike began. In support of the strike, Screen Actors Guild urged its members to appear on programs that had independent agreements with the WGA, such as the Late Show with David Letterman and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.|$|E

25|$|Stone {{was from}} the West Indies and had been banished from Boston for malfeasance, {{including}} drunkenness, adultery, and piracy. He was known to have powerful connections in other colonies, {{as well as in}} London, and he was expected to use them against the Boston colony. Setting sail from Boston, Stone abducted two Western Niantic men, forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> him the way up the Connecticut River. Soon after, he and his crew were suddenly attacked and killed by a larger group of Western Niantic. The initial reactions in Boston varied from indifference to outright joy at Stone's death, but the colonial officials later decided to protest the killing. They did not accept the Pequots' excuses that they had been unaware of Stone's nationality. Pequot sachem Sassacus sent some wampum to atone for the killing, but refused the colonists' demands that the warriors responsible for Stone's death be turned over to them for trial and punishment.|$|E
500|$|The fares on {{the branch}} were {{collected}} by the conductor on the train, who had to pull a cord, similar to {{how it was done}} with trolleys. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which owned the branch, wanted to reduce service on the branch, and eventually abandon it. [...] They purposely looked the other way when conductors skimmed something off the top, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a lower ridership to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in return improve their chances for abandoning the branch.|$|E
500|$|Zwingli {{initially}} {{appealed to}} scripture against Catholic opponents {{in order to}} counter their appeal to the church—which included the councils, the church fathers, the schoolmen, and the popes. To him, these authorities were based on man and liable to error. He noted that [...] "the fathers must yield to the word of God and not the word of God to the fathers". His insistence of using the word of God did not preclude him from using the councils or the church fathers in his arguments. He gave them no independent authority, but he used <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the views he held were not simply his own.|$|E

To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with {{the seriousness of the}} individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves.

500|$|The third {{important}} {{theory of}} hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space. The spatial theory was originally championed by O'Keefe and Nadel, who {{were influenced by}} E.C.

[...] O'Keefe and his student Dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in the rat hippocampus that appeared to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> activity related to the rat's location within its environment. [...] Despite skepticism from other investigators, O'Keefe and his co-workers, especially Lynn Nadel, continued to investigate this question, {{in a line of}} work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. [...] There is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function {{plays an important role in}} spatial coding, but the details are widely debated.|$|E
500|$|According to Lake, they {{experimented with}} {{different}} gameplay mechanics, {{some of which}} they judged to make the game too slow or too tactical. They intended to [...] "recapture the action spectacle" [...] featured in their Max Payne series, along with several modern iterations. The game {{was designed to be}} fast-paced, but the concept of time-travel did not accommodate the elements of this kind of gameplay. As a result, the team opted to include a broader theme: time itself. They set the game in a world where time collapses, leading to various dangerous situations. According to Lake, the theme of time connected all the elements featured in the game. The setting also allowed the team to add new gameplay mechanics, such as the time manipulation powers. They created Quantum Break as a third-person shooter because of their past experiences with the genre and because they thought that the third-person perspective would allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a strong leading character, while a purely story-oriented game would not feel like a triple A title.|$|E
