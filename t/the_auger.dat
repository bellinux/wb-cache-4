5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Burhop was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford. Under the supervision of Mark Oliphant, he investigated nuclear fusion. He produced a non-relativistic theory of <b>the</b> <b>Auger</b> effect in 1935, followed by a relativistic treatment the following year. He later wrote a monograph on the subject. He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in 1936, and helped Professor Thomas Laby build up the physics department there.|$|E

5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and <b>the</b> <b>Auger</b> effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

5|$|Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an {{industrial}} businessman, {{an officer in}} the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York.

He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel.

25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight augering (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance. No casing is required. A cement grout mix is then pumped down the stem of <b>the</b> <b>auger.</b> While the cement grout is pumped, <b>the</b> <b>auger</b> is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to see a single full length bar placed at the center of each pile.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called <b>the</b> <b>Auger</b> Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E

25|$|Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter set in an {{alternate}} history. Many of its gameplay features stem from this, {{most notably the}} weapons. Some weapons are based on real weapons circa the 1950s, while some weapons are futuristically altered {{in accordance with the}} game's storyline. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles, such as those found in the Ratchet and Clank series, with its proprietary development engine and physics system to create unique human and Chimeran weaponry. Each weapon provides a unique play style and strategy. An example of this is found with <b>the</b> <b>Auger</b> (Chimeran). The primary fire for this weapon is simple rapid fire, but the bullets burrow through walls, actually coming out stronger on the other side, opening up a whole new level of strategy. The secondary fire creates a barrier that is resistant to all bullets but its own. In addition to the usual short- and long-range weapons, the game features several different types of grenades, with both historical and futuristic varieties. For example, one grenade, known as the Backlash grenade, is capable of creating a dome-shaped barrier, where the player can enter for cover. The barrier reflects shots from opposing Chimera. Some weapons are not available on the first play-through of the game but can be found at certain locations on replaying the game.|$|E

500|$|Ice cores are {{collected}} by cutting around a cylinder {{of ice in}} a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. [...] Early cores were often collected with hand augers and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. [...] An auger is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, {{at the lower end of}} which are cutting blades. [...] Hand augers can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle, and some can be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation.
