50|$|Congenital <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb,</b> (or Pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb),</b> is a <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> in {{neonates}} {{and young}} children. Triggering, clicking or snapping is observed by flexion or {{extension of the}} interphalangeal joint (IPJ).

5000|$|... ==Cause== It {{is unclear}} whether {{the cause of the}} <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> is {{congenital}} or acquired.

Surgical treatment should also be considered when observation and/or splint therapy hasn’t achieved sufficient results after 49 months. Unlike the surgical treatment given for adults, which is unambiguously a surgical release of the A1 pulley of the thumb, the optimum surgical treatment for infants {{has not yet been}} discerned. In case of infants, research has shown that only in 15% of the cases A1 pulley release alone is sufficient. In most of the cases there was an additional annular pulley structure distal to the A1 to be released resolving the triggering: the so-called Av pulley or variable pulley. Therefore infants and adults need to be treated differently as the main problem is different.|$|E

Repetitive forceful compression, tensile stress, and resistive flexion, causes inflammation, swelling, and microtrauma, that results in thickening (commonly a nodular formation) of the tendon distal to the pulley and stenosis of the tendon sheath leading to a painful digital base, limitation of finger movements, triggering, snapping, locking, and deformity progressively.|$|E

Residual deformity is defined as persistent flexion deformities of the thumb and radial deviation at the IPJ. Extension exercises and splinting can be added to the observation. These two elements have favourable results in improvement in flexion impairment of the thumb. However, compared to observation, the benefit of merely extension exercises and splinting are still unclear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Congenital <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> is an {{uncommon}} anamoly of children. Its management is controversial, ranging from observation to extensive surgical release. We report {{a case of}} delayed presentation of bilateral <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> along with {{a brief review of}} past literature. Case Report: A six year old girl presented with fixed flexion deformity of interphalangeal joints of both thumbs and Notta’s nodules. It is diagnosed as <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> and release of bilateral A 1 pulleys is done. But we found another constricting annular pulley just distal to A 1. Only after splitting the distal pulley, we could get complete extension of interphalangeal joints. At two years follow-up, the child is free of complications.

40|$|Background: Pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> {{is due to}} {{deformed}} flexion of the interphalangeal joint. We {{previously reported}} that pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> can spontaneously resolve in> 60 % of patients at the median follow-up of 48 months. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether there were any more cases of resolution with a follow-up of more than 5 years and whether any residual deformities remain, and so to confirm the natural history of pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb.</b> Methods: We prospectively followed 87 thumbs in 67 patients with pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> and these patients didn’t receive any treatment such as passive stretching, splinting or surgery. The date of the first visit ranged from April 1994 to March 2005. The patients were evaluated every six-months prior to resolution and annually after resolution. The median duration of follow-up was 87. 3 months (range, 60 to 156 months). Results: Of the 87 trigger thumbs, 66 (75. 9 %) resolved spontaneously. The median time from the initial visit to resolution was 49. 0 months (95 % confidence interval, 41. 1 to 56. 9). There were no residual deformities that resolved beyond 48 months. Although complete resolution did not occur in the remaining 21 thumbs, the flexion deformities did improve in all 21 thumbs. There were no other differences between the two groups besides the average duration of follow-up. There was no difference in resolution based on gender. Conclusions: Pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> can spontaneously resolve in> 75 % of the cases after a follow-up period of at least 5 years. An operation may be delayed or avoided in the majority of cases. This may help both the families and the surgeons make decisions regarding the proper treatment of pediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{personal}} treatment {{concept for}} <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> in children is presented.

Although it {{is a simple}} pathology, careful diagnosis is mandatory to rule out other reasons with the same symptoms as <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb,</b> as some of these will lead to severe aesthetic and functional impairment. In 26 patients with persistent symptoms, the A 1 ring ligament of the thumb was cut. Free active and passive joint motion was comparable to the opposite side in 92. 7 % of patients. In 2 cases a secondary operation was necessary because of incomplete A 1 ring ligament release. If it is diagnosed and operated on early with a careful operative technique, nowadays no aesthetic or functional impairment should occur in children because of <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to report our {{experiences}} and surgical results in paediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> and to review the literature about paediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb.</b> Methods: We performed a retrospective study of our paediatric <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> patients who underwent open surgery. Our study includes 19 thumbs of 13 children with a mean age of 30 months. Analysis into gender, age of onset, age of surgery, family history and postoperative complications were carried out. Biopsies of A 1 annular pulley from 6 thumbs were examined histopathologically. Results: In all, 6 (46 %) of the children presented with bilateral trigger thumbs and 6 (46 %) of the children had palpable node of Notta. Two (15 %) of children who had bilateral involvement, had a positive family history. Flexion deformity and nodule were commonly observed during physical examination. After surgery, there were no complications or recurrences. There were no secondary surgeries. Histopathological examination of specimens sent to pathology department showed mostly degenerated fibrous tissue. Conclusion: Surgical treatment with A 1 pulley release resulted in successful resolution of <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb.</b> However, conservative treatments can be considered before 3 years of age for 6 months before surgery as a safe and useful method.

40|$|<b>Trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> of childhood, termed {{congenital}} <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb,</b> is a pathology of the flexor pollicis longus tendon with {{an unknown}} etiology. In this study, treatment outcomes of 47 trigger thumbs of 36 children were evaluated. There were 18 males and 18 females {{with a mean}} age of 34 months (9 months- 13 years). Average age of recognition of pathology by the family was 20. 5 months (0 - 8 years). In seven of 11 bilateral cases pathology was recognized simultaneously while in the other four, diagnosis was made at different times. We used conservative treatment for all patients under three years of age, which was unsuccessful. Thus, surgical relase was performed in all cases. In the mean follow-up of seven years (range 5 - 15), contracture and palpable nodules disappeared. In conclusion, we believe <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> in childhood should be treated surgically and that the term “congenital <b>trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> ” should be changed to “developmental trigger thumb”. <b>Trigger</b> <b>thumb</b> of childhood is known as a pathology of the flexor tendon system 1 - 3.
