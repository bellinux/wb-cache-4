5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The notch {{is a result of}} extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to <b>the</b> <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> the Maltese tourism {{market in}} the past has been largely due to trends in the {{preferences}} of tourists from the United Kingdom, who comprise Malta's largest tourism market. Although Malta's uniform use of English, its traditional ties to the United Kingdom and low-cost travel options have made it an attractive option to British tourists, changing preferences of these tourists can impact Malta's tourism income quite significantly. For example, the increasing preference of British tourists for Spanish destinations during the 1980s was reflected in a drop in Malta's tourism numbers during that period.|$|E

5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. <b>The</b> <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine <b>the</b> <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> stock market returns in a small, internationally integrated stock market are related to <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> financial and business cycle variables. It employs a low frequency monthly dataset for Australia including stock market returns, interest rates, inflation, the money supply, industrial production and the current account deficit over the period from July 1972 to January 1994. A novel feature of the analysis is the estimation strategy employed to overcome the generated regressors problem which pervades some recent related research. Specifically, the procedure of employing a two-stage estimation process to first estimate conditional volatilities and then model their interrelationships yields inefficient estimates, introduces bias into a number of diagnostic test statistics and generates potentially invalid inferences. This problem is overcome in the current paper by jointly estimating the equation for <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> stock market returns together with the equations determining <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> all variables included in the model using the generalized least squares (GLS) estimation procedure together with the Hendry general-to-specific modelling strategy. Among the most important determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian stock market are found to be <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> inflation and interest rates which are directly associated with stock market <b>volatility,</b> and <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> industrial production, <b>the</b> current account deficit and the money supply which are indirectly associated with stock market conditional volatility. Among these variables, the strongest effect is found to be from <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money supply to <b>the</b> conditional <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market. By contrast, no evidence is found <b>of</b> <b>volatility</b> spillover from <b>the</b> foreign exchange market to the stock market in Australia. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} extent to which the great US {{macroeconomic}} stability since the mid- 1980 s can be accounted for by changes in oil shocks and the elastiticy of oil in output. To do this we estimate a DSGE model with an oil-producing sector before and after 1984 and perform counterfactual simulations. We nest two popular explanations for the Great Moderation: (1) smaller (non-oil) real shocks; and (2) better monetary policy. We …nd that oil played an important role in the stabilization, especially of in‡ation. In particular, the lower elasticity of oil in output explains around a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> in‡ation, and 18 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> GDP growth. In turn, smaller oil shocks explain around 17 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower in‡ation <b>volatility,</b> and 11 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> GDP growth. This notwithstanding, around half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> in‡ation is explained by better monetary policy alone, while 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>volatility</b> <b>of</b> GDP growth is attributed to smaller TFP shocks. ...|$|R
25|$|Distillation is {{the process}} of {{separating}} the components or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} for pricing options on assets with stochastic volatility. We start by taking as given the prices of a few simple, liquid European options. More specifically, we take as given the “surface ” <b>of</b> Black-Scholes implied <b>volatilities</b> for European options with varying strike prices and maturities. We show that <b>the</b> Black-Scholes implied <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> at-the-money options converge to the underlying asset’s instantaneous (stochastic) <b>volatility</b> as <b>the</b> time to maturity goes to zero. We model the stochastic processes followed by <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities</b> <b>of</b> options of all maturities and strike prices as a joint diffusion with the stock price.
