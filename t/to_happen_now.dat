500|$|As {{leader of}} the Alberta Liberals, Boyle corresponded {{extensively}} with Liberal Party of Canada leader (and Prime Minister of Canada) William Lyon Mackenzie King; according to Foster, Boyle's letters to King were [...] "a mixture of useless information and pleas to be rescued by an appointment to the bench." [...] It is possible {{that one of his}} letters had some impact on history, however: in 1924, while Greenfield was attempting to negotiate control of Alberta's natural resources from King's federal government, Boyle sent King a letter warning him that the UFA was doomed in the next election unless [...] "something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] King drew out negotiations until Greenfield returned to Alberta empty-handed; soon after, Greenfield was forced from office by his own backbenchers, and replaced by Brownlee.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee {{became the}} province's chief {{negotiator}} on resource questions in October 1921. [...] Though early attempts at reaching agreement were {{hampered by the}} unwillingness of the Maritime provinces {{to agree to the}} necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased, negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s. [...] Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals [...] "unless something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. [...] After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval. [...] As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.|$|E
2500|$|In North American Major League Baseball, a game may {{end in a}} tie only due {{to weather}} or, historically, {{darkness}} (a called game due to darkness is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> that all Major League parks have floodlights; darkness also means reaching the curfew prohibiting innings from starting after 1am local time). Before 2007, tie games ended by weather were replayed from the start, but since 2007, the games are continued from where they left off. [...] A tie game may also be declared if a game is tied, the two teams are not scheduled to play again {{for the remainder of}} the year, and the game does not affect playoff implications.|$|E

6000|$|His reasoning--unless reason {{be denied}} him--was simple. This {{man he had}} met, more than once, {{in the company of}} Steward. Amity had existed between him and Steward, for they had sat at table, and drunk together. Steward was lost. Michael knew not where to find him, and was himself a {{prisoner}} in the back yard of a strange place. What had once happened, could again happen. It had happened that Steward, Del Mar, and Michael had sat at table together on divers occasions. It was probable that such a combination would happen again, was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now,</b> and, once more, in the bright-lighted cabaret, he would sit on a chair, Del Mar on one side, {{and on the other side}} beloved Steward with a glass of beer before him--all of which might be called [...] "leaping to a conclusion"; for conclusion there was, and upon the conclusion Michael acted.|$|E

6000|$|Some of {{them were}} the vicarages of slum parishes. The old sailor had got hold of one cheap, and de Barral got hold of his daughter--which was a good bargain for him.

With a fund of simple gaiety, and with no ambitions; but, woman-like, she longed for change and for {{something}} interesting <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> and then. It was she who encouraged de Barral to accept the offer of a post in the west-end branch of a great bank. It appears he shrank from such a great adventure for a long time.

60|$|Some {{circumstance}} {{had apparently}} caused much grief to Charley just previous to {{the entry of}} the choir, and he had absently taken down a small looking-glass, holding it before his face to learn how the human countenance appeared when engaged in crying, which survey led him to pause at the various points in each wail that were more than ordinarily striking, for a thorough appreciation of the general effect. Bessy was leaning against a chair, and glancing under the plaits about the waist of the plaid frock she wore, to notice the original unfaded pattern of the material as there preserved, her face bearing an expression of regret that the brightness had passed away from the visible portions. Mrs. Dewy sat in a brown settle {{by the side of}} the glowing wood fire--so glowing that with a heedful compression of the lips she would now and then rise and put her hand upon the hams and flitches of bacon lining the chimney, to reassure herself that they were not being broiled instead of smoked--a misfortune that had been known <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>now</b> and then at Christmas-time.|$|E
