Work in this field made it possible <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and digital signal processing offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.|$|E
25|$|Three {{very special}} {{conditions}} {{are required for}} a star to evolve {{all the way to}} a gamma-ray burst under this theory: the star must be very massive (probably at least 40 Solar masses on the main sequence) to form a central black hole in the first place, the star must be rapidly rotating to develop an accretion torus capable of launching jets, and the star must have low metallicity in order <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> its hydrogen envelope so the jets can reach the surface. As a result, gamma-ray bursts are far rarer than ordinary core-collapse supernovae, which only require that the star be massive enough to fuse all the way to iron.|$|E

She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At {{the end of the}} performance she asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it ... I don't need money... I need love."

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

2500|$|Revenge pranks are {{a common}} theme in the Sut Lovingood tales. In [...] "Parson John Bullen's Lizards," [...] for instance, Parson Bullen, a fire and {{brimstone}} preacher, beats Sut with a club after catching him in the bushes with a girl at a camp meeting. Later, when Bullen is preaching to a large crowd, Sut releases several lizards which crawl up Bullen's legs, prompting him <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> his clothes in terror. Another target of Sut's revenge is Sicily Burns, a mountain woman who tricks Sut into drinking baking soda. In response, Sut causes a bull to wreak havoc at Sicily's wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Extremely {{massive stars}} (more than {{approximately}} [...] ), {{which are very}} luminous and thus have very rapid stellar winds, lose mass so rapidly due to radiation pressure that they tend <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> their own envelopes before they can expand to become red supergiants, and thus retain extremely high surface temperatures (and blue-white color) from their main-sequence time onwards. The largest stars of the current generation are about [...] because the outer layers would be expelled by the extreme radiation. Although lower-mass stars normally do not burn off their outer layers so rapidly, they can likewise avoid becoming red giants or red supergiants {{if they are in}} binary systems close enough so that the companion star strips off the envelope as it expands, or if they rotate rapidly enough so that convection extends {{all the way from the}} core to the surface, resulting in the absence of a separate core and envelope due to thorough mixing.|$|E
2500|$|In the ditch, the {{political}} hacks are ordered <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> {{their clothes and}} engage in a diving contest. Dulness says, [...] "Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around/ The stream, be his the Weekly Journals, bound" [...] (II 267–8), while a load of lead {{will go to the}} deepest diver and a load of coal to the others who participate. [...] "The Weekly Journals" [...] was a collective noun, referring to London Journal, Mist's Journal, British Journal, Daily Journal, inter al. [...] In this contest, John Dennis climbs up as high as a post and dives in, disappearing forever. Next, [...] "Smedly" [...] (Jonathan Smedley, a religious opportunist who criticised Jonathan Swift for gain) dives in and vanishes. Others attempt the task, but none succeed like Leonard Welsted (who had satirised Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot's play Three Hours after Marriage in 1717), for he goes in swinging his arms like a windmill (to splash all with mud): [...] "No crab more active in the dirty dance,/ Downward to climb, and backward to advance" [...] (II 296–7). He wins the Journals, but Smedly reappears, saying that he had gone {{all the way down to}} Hades, where he had seen that a branch of Styx flows into the Thames, so that all who drink city water grow dull and forgetful from Lethe.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And Cain spoke to Abel his brother," [...] a Midrash {{imagined}} the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them. The first took {{the land and the}} second took the movables. The first told the second that he was standing on the first's land. The second retorted that the first was wearing the second's clothes. The second told the first <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> his clothes. The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground. Out of this quarrel, as [...] reports, [...] "Cain rose up against his brother Abel." [...] Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that {{it would have to be}} built in his. For [...] says, [...] "And it came to pass, when they were in the field," [...] and [...] "field" [...] refers to the Temple, as [...] equates the two when it says, [...] "Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field." [...] Out of this argument (in {{the words of}} [...] ), [...] "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." [...] Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he would have her, because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Mukerji {{starred in}} the anthology film Bombay Talkies consisting of four short films. Mukerji {{was part of the}} segment entitled Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh in which she played Gayatri, a journalist who discovers that her husband (played by Randeep Hooda) is gay; it was her fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar. The film was screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as part of the centenary year celebrations of Indian cinema. Despite poor box office returns, Bombay Talkies met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed to Johar's segment. Tushar Joshi of Daily News and Analysis said that Mukerji was successful in [...] "proving [...] she's the queen of subtlety when it comes <b>to</b> <b>stripping</b> <b>off</b> the make-up and letting herself fly".|$|R
