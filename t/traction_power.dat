5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area will be in the cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). <b>Traction</b> <b>power</b> substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the {{corridor}} uses three catenary systems. From Washington, D.C., to Sunnyside Yard (just east of New York Penn Station), Amtrak's 25Hz <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system (originally {{built by the}} Pennsylvania Railroad) supplies 12 kV at 25Hz. From Sunnyside to Mill River (just east of New Haven), the former New Haven Railroad's system, since modified by Metro-North, supplies 12.5 kV at 60Hz.

25|$|In the United States, 25Hz, a once-common {{industrial}} power frequency, {{is used on}} Amtrak's 25Hz <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> {{system at}} 12kV on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City and on the Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. SEPTA's 25Hz <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> system uses the same 12kV voltage on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical catenary voltage, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak power distribution system has a 138kV transmission network that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12kV to feed the catenary system. The SEPTA power distribution system uses a 2:1 ratio autotransformer system, with the catenary fed at 12kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24kV. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad used an 11kV system between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, which was converted to 12.5kV 60Hz in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{power supply}} was {{connected}} to the <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> network by means of two new spur lines running via three new substations at Roth, Ilmenau and Eischleben. The existing Ebensfeld substation was expanded for the power supply of the new line. There was no equalisation of the earth masses, which meant that about 16 million cubic metres of earth was deposited at 24 landfill sites. Near Masserberg. for example, 1.8million cubic metres was dumped covering an area of 54.8hectares, with a maximum height of 27metres.|$|E

25|$|Two new <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> {{lines are}} used to supply power to the line (110kV). The 23.3kilometre-long {{southern}} line is to branch off at Wörlsdorf from the existing Nuremberg–Weimar line and end at the new Roth substation at the north portal of the Müß tunnel near Welchendorf in Thuringia. The 21kilometre-long northern line leads from the new Eischleben substation to the Wolfsberg substation. Over a length of about 4.4kilometres, the railway power line is carried through the Wipfra valley on 13 masts of a 380 kV transmission line, which runs from the Vieselbach substation to the Altenfeld substation. This eliminated the need for 15railway power line masts. For energy supply and data transmission, moreover, there are approximately 1,200km of cable.|$|E
25|$|The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project—which {{ran from}} 2006 to 2009—was {{undertaken}} to repair aging infrastructure and increase passenger capacity at Brown Line stations. On February 20, 2006, the CTA broke {{ground on the}} project. All {{but one of the}} Brown Line stations were reconstructed to be ADA compliant and to accommodate eight-car trains. The right-of-way between Kimball and Rockwell Avenue was modernized. <b>Traction</b> <b>power</b> equipment and train control systems were upgraded and a new fiber optic communication network installed. Merchandise Mart was the only station not to receive any work as it had previously been reconstructed from 1987 to 1988, and was already ADA compliant and able to accommodate 8-car trains. Another two stations—Kimball and Western—received small platform extensions but little other work, and the other 16 stations were completely rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|The Watford DC Line between Queens Park and Harrow & Wealdstone and the North London Line between Richmond and Gunnersbury {{are used}} by London Overground trains {{designed}} for 750V third rail and Bakerloo line trains designed for 630V third and fourth rail. As a compromise, the nominal line voltage is 650V, and since 1970 the centre rail has been bonded to the return running rail. There are no special provisions required at Queens Park, where the two dissimilar systems meet, just a gap longer than one coach of a Bakerloo line train at the entry to (and exit from) the Bakerloo, which operates with a nominal -210V on the fourth rail and +420V on the third rail.

25|$|In 1968, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8Vab unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for <b>traction</b> <b>power</b> distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4-TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting. in the TC unit as the 8-VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4-VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4-REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.|$|E
