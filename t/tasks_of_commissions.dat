French command had ordered the Marquis Duquesne to break through the British blockade and reinforce La Clue and then with superiority of numbers break out of Cartagena and make their way to America. Osborn intercepted Duquesne and his three ships of the line and one frigate. The subsequent action became known as the Battle of Cartagena and took place on 28 February 1758. Osborn’s squadron captured two of the French line of battle ships and, under the guns of the Spanish castle the 60-gun French Oriflamme was driven on shore by the Montagu and the [...] Whilst the battle was not particularly grand the annihilation of the forces under Duquesne had two distinct effects. Firstly, the battle restored much of the pride that had been sapped from the navy after several defeats including those at Toulon and Minorca. Secondly, the siege of Louisburg and its surrender led to the French being marginalised as a significant power in North America. The battle can therefore be considered by the British as one of the defining achievements of the Seven Years' War.

40|$|As the Industry Commission {{prepares to}} engage in its {{examination}} of the Australian nonprofit sector as defined in its draft terms of reference, it confronts what it should regard as a fundamental dilemma; {{the meaning of the}} construct `effectiveness'.

Such a response highlights a fundamental characteristic of the human services generally, not only in the nonprofit arena: their relative freedom from evaluation.
