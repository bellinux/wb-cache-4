5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was designed to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> and technicians.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days without access <b>to</b> <b>lawyers.</b> Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E
5|$|Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was {{the first}} {{significant}} artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy <b>to</b> <b>lawyers,</b> doctors, professors, writers and ministers, adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition of Joshua Reynolds. He became a knight in 1822 and the King's painter and limner in 1823, marking {{a return to the}} post being associated with the production of art. His pupils included the brothers William (Alexander) (1772–1841), Archibald (1765–1835) and Andrew Robertson (1777–1845). William and Archibald went on to found the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish miniaturist of his day. Also associated with Radeburn towards {{the end of his career}} were John Syme (1795–1861) and Colvin Smith (1795–1875).|$|E

5|$|In {{preparing}} for their roles, the actors were granted access <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> who {{would act as}} advisors. Ford observed murder trials with Pakula at the Recorder's Court in Detroit and viewed training footage from the Michigan Prosecutors' Association.

5|$|On September 20, 1994, {{the city}} and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against {{the city and}} Superintendent LeRoy Martin.

The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling.

25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it {{comes at a time when}} the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal {{procedure}} were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar <b>to</b> <b>lawyers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Orton Plantation is a {{historic}} plantation house in the Smithville Township of Brunswick County, North Carolina, United States. Located beside the Cape Fear River between Wilmington and Southport, Orton Plantation {{is considered to be}} a near-perfect example of Southern antebellum architecture. Built in 1735 by the co-founder of Brunswick Town, the Orton Plantation house is one of the oldest structures in Brunswick County. During its history Orton Plantation has been attacked by Native Americans, used as a military hospital, and been home <b>to</b> <b>lawyers,</b> physicians, military leaders, and a Colonial governor. Although the home is privately owned and closed to the public, the Orton Plantation Gardens and family-owned chapel have become a tourist destination in Southeastern North Carolina, attracting thousands of visitors each year. On April 11, 1973, the Orton Plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|What caused Lynne Stewart, {{after more}} than two decades of defense lawyering in the best {{tradition}} of the legal profession to cross the line? Holding aside the political climate of the times, did Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s approach <b>to</b> <b>lawyering</b> [...] whether in political or not terribly political cases [...] lead to her demise? Is her approach <b>to</b> <b>lawyering</b> different from most of the bar? This paper discusses the conduct that led to Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s prosecution and her approach <b>to</b> <b>lawyering</b> generally. The author examines whether her view of zeal and devotion is at odds with the prevailing ethics and ethos of defense lawyering, and, if not, what went wrong. She also explores the question of boundaries in lawyering generally...|$|R
25|$|More residences were built, {{primarily}} to be rented <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> and legislators {{working in the}} capitol and the courts. The city began to expand and annex surrounding land to handle its growth. The opening of the Erie Canal in the 1820s {{and the development of}} railroads in later decades made the city a transportation hub, and as its commercial power and the state's grew it assumed more political importance. Smaller buildings remained the norm along the side streets, with churches springing up next to them. Richard Upjohn's French Gothic St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches. Another church, St. Mary's, by the local firm of Nicholls and Brown, became the focal point of a neighborhbood of small houses on and near Lodge Street.

25|$|After his {{personal}} tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford {{began working on}} a book to report the important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state lawyers and judges. He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write concisely {{to the fact that he}} never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise. Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. So careful was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them <b>to</b> <b>lawyers</b> in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.|$|E
