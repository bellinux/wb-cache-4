5|$|There is {{currently}} no cure or effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) which slows {{progression of the}} disease. As of 2010 more than 6.6million people were <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> in low and middle income countries. Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play the backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> and forming them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his vocal-based recordings of the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E
5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about <b>taking</b> <b>them,</b> and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E

"It's apt {{to make a}} {{mess with}} clothes, <b>taking</b> <b>'em</b> out and putting 'em in again," [...] said Mrs. Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly, [...] "but it 'ud be a pity {{for you to go}} away without seeing it.

5|$|In a 1983 study, only 5% of {{patients}} who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% {{of those who had}} been <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 2009, Robben {{moved to}} Bayern Munich for around €25million. He {{was given the}} number 10 shirt, last worn by his fellow Dutchman, Roy Makaay. On 9 March 2010, Robben scored the {{deciding}} goal in Bayern's 2–3 defeat (4–4 on aggregate over two legs) against Fiorentina, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> through to the quarter-finals of the 2009–10 Champions League on away goals.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> back to the ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E

I was oiling my working-day boots without <b>taking</b> <b>'em</b> off, and wi' my head hanging down, when she just brushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf. 'Ann,' I said, says I, and then,--but, Dick I'm afeard 'twill be no help to thee; for we were such a rum couple, your mother and I, leastways one half was, that is myself--and your mother's charms was more in the manner than the material." ...|$|R

5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated {{many of the people}} who remained, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E
5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|After {{a couple}} of months pondering his future career plans, he {{received}} a telephone call from the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E

5|$|Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke {{pretended that}} his ships were French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives {{the state of}} defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats {{in the mouth of}} the Pasig River. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> {{on a field}} trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{introduced}} {{players with}} top-level experience such as Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce. In {{his second season}} the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position, followed by three years of play-off semifinal defeats. They also reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shootout which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis's position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent, replaced two months later by Steve Bruce. Bruce shook up a stale team, <b>taking</b> <b>them</b> from mid-table into the play-offs where they beat Norwich City on penalties to win promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from <b>taking</b> <b>them.</b> He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E
