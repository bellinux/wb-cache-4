40|$|Abstract. The {{interest}} on development of iron aluminide alloy {{is due to}} its high oxidation and sulfidation resistance at high temperatures. Barriers against corrosion are {{of great interest to}} many industrial fields principally to the chemical and Oil and Gas industries. The objective on development of iron aluminide alloy is the formation of the ordered intermetallics. The intermetallics, which are recognized for its excellent corrosion resistance, are Fe 3 Al and FeAl. In addition to the good behavior at corrosion environmental, the aluminides has low density and low material cost. This work presents the iron aluminide development alloy with a welding <b>coating</b> <b>process.</b> The Plasma <b>transferred</b> arc <b>coating</b> <b>process,</b> PTA, is recognized to produce coatings with better properties when compared to the conventional welding coating applications. Besides that was mentioned, the coating material could be feed at powder form becoming possible the formation of different intermetallics and new alloys by the combination of the metallic powders, that will be melt into the plasma arc and will form new constituents. The aluminum powder was deposited using PTA on low carbon steel. The alloy formation with the intermetallics already mentioned is reached with a range of dilution that is correlated with the binary iron-aluminum phase diagram. Two different conditions of processing were tested, were maintained the parameters that supply the energy of the arc, except the powder feeding that was changed to produce more or less dilution. For the two conditions tested, the intermetallics formed are presented distributed homogeneously in the coating. The precipitation of the intermetallics occurs into the grain, producing so a distinct precipitation-free zone near the grain boundary...|$|R

TiA 1 N coatings are usually used in high-speed machining due to its excellent surface hardness and wear resistance. The TiA 1 N coatings were produced using Physical Vapour Deposition magnetron sputtering <b>process.</b> The <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameter will be selected as the input parameters and the hardness as an output of the process. There are several <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters in TiA 1 N <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> but for this paper only three <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameter will be considered.

40|$|Due to {{the present}} {{shortage}} of He- 3 and the associated tremendous increase of its price, the supply of large neutron detection systems with He- 3 becomes unaffordable. Alternative neutron detection concepts, therefore, have been invented based on solid B- 10 converters. These concepts require development in thin film deposition technique regarding high adhesion, thickness uniformity and chemical purity of the converter coating on large area substrates. We report on the sputter deposition of highly uniform large-area (B 4 C) -B- 10 coatings of up to 2 mu m thickness with a thickness deviation below 4 % using the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht large area sputtering system. The (B 4 C) -B- 10 coatings are x-ray amorphous and highly adhesive to the substrate. Material analysis by means of X-ray-Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectrometry, and Rutherford-Back-Scattering (RBS) revealed low impurities concentration in the coatings. The isotope composition determined by Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectrometry, RBS, and inelastic nuclear reaction analysis of the converter coatings evidences almost identical B- 10 isotope contents in the sputter target and in the deposited coating. Neutron conversion and detection test measurements with variable irradiation geometry of the converter coating demonstrate an average relative quantum efficiency ranging from 65 % to 90 % for cold neutrons as compared to a black He- 3 -monitor. Thus, these converter coatings {{contribute to the development}} of He- 3 -free prototype detectors based on neutron grazing incidence. <b>Transferring</b> the developed <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> to an industrial scale sputtering system can make alternative He- 3 -free converter elements available for large area neutron detection systems.

40|$|Nowadays, coated {{materials}} {{are widely used}} due to their excellent properties especially for the hardness performance. The hardness of coated tools {{is determined by the}} <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters. Traditionally, optimization to obtain the best coating performance of the parameters in a <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> was done by trial and error approach. However the traditional approach has raised issues with regards to cost and customization. In this research, these two issues were addressed by using a computational intelligence approach to develop a model for predicting the output responses in order to identify the optimal parameters used in <b>coating</b> <b>process.</b> Previous studies have shown that this approach was successfully adopted for optimization purpose in many types of domains. However, it was not yet applied in the <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> domain. Thus, two methods from computational intelligence approach were applied, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The comparisons of the performances of the developed models were conducted based on predictive performance measurements such as percentage error, mean squared error (MSE), co-efficient determination (R 2), and model accuracy and complexity. The results showed that, SVM obtained better predictive performances and less complicated in comparison to other prediction models.

40|$|AbstractHere, we {{describe}} a nondestructive approach using terahertz wave to detect crack initiation in a film-coated {{layer on a}} drug tablet. During scale-up and scale-down of the film <b>coating</b> <b>process,</b> differences in film density and gaps between the film-coated layer and the uncoated tablet were generated {{due to differences in}} film <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters, such as the tablet-filling rate in the coating machine, spray pressure, and gas–liquid ratio etc. Tablets using the PEO/PEG formulation were employed as uncoated tablets.

Using our novel approach with terahertz wave nondestructively detect film surface density (FSD) and interface density differences (IDDs) between the film-coated layer and an uncoated tablet. We also found that a reduced FSD and IDD between the film-coated layer and uncoated tablet increased the risk of crack initiation in the film-coated layer, thereby enabling us to nondestructively predict initiation of cracks in the film-coated layer.
