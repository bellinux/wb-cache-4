The {{term has}} been used by different scholars with different shades of meaning in several different areas of second language learning, teaching, and testing. In the pages that follow, I review some uses of the terms, but let's begin with an example of cross-cultural communication that brings into relief the fact that command of language forms is not enough to ensure successful communication. In her book on the ethnography of communication, Saville-Troike (1989, pp. 131 - 132) reported the following exchange in a kindergarten classroom on the Navajo Reservation: A Navajo man {{opened the door to the}} classroom and stood silently, looking at the floor. <b>The</b> Anglo-American <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> "Good morning " and waited expectantly, but the man did not respond. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> then <b>said</b> "My name is Mrs. Jones, " and again waited for a response. There was none. In the meantime, a child in the room put away his crayons and got his coat from <b>the</b> rack. <b>The</b> <b>teacher,</b> noting <b>this,</b> <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> man, "Oh, are you taking Billy now?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine how {{teachers}} teach English and if they feel that their knowledge of English is enough to be teaching English.

During the observations I {{will look at the}} amount of English <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> speaks, which methodology <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> uses and <b>the</b> content of the lesson. The methodology that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> used during my observations was, total physical response, scaffolding, zone of proximal development, pronunciation, phrases and behaviorism. What I could see during to my observations was that in the classes where <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> spoke more English than Swedish the pupils did so too. I could also see that <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> used different methods during their lessons because they wanted to benefit all pupils, since the pupils prefer to learn in different ways. The content of the lessons was a subject that the pupils can easily relate to and has an interest in. From the questionnaires I could see that all teachers considered themselves to be at the same level in their knowledge of English according to which level they marked in the CEFR-scale. Three of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> that their English knowledge didn’t affect their English lessons or their choice of methods.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the opportunities for oral language development that teachers offer pupils during lessons in Swedish in grade 3. The following questions guided the study: how do teachers perceive that they offer the pupils opportunities for oral language development in their teaching and what possibilities for oral language development do <b>teachers</b> offer pupils? <b>The</b> methods used to answer the questions are interview and observation of two teachers in two different classrooms. In all, two interviews and four observations were conducted. An observation schedule was used during the observations and the interviews were semi-structured, based on the same questions. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The collected material showed that the oral activities which <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> they offered their pupils were working in pairs or small groups, whole-class conversations and drama. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>said</b> that they interacted with the pupils through taking turns and asking questions. <b>The</b> activities <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> offered their pupils during the four observations were whole-class conversations led by <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> structured conversations in small groups and spontaneous conversations among pupils and between pupils and teacher, and interactive book reading. The interactions used by <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> took <b>the</b> form of speech, questions and body language. The conclusion of the study is that teachers must have more tools for taking advantage of opportunities to let the pupils develop their oral language. The view of what oral language development can involve should also be broadened...|$|R

Supplementary textbooks on English grammar, vocabulary, and English proficiency tests, such as the TOEIC and General English Proficiency Test, were frequently used in the regular and afterschool English classes. Listening articles, conversations, or passages in the English magazines were played to all students in class once a week. During the 30 -min listening sessions, students sometimes listened to the recordings and read the magazine, or took a listening quiz.|$|R

5000|$|The {{new part}} of {{educator}} effectiveness policies is {{the integration of}} outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that {{can be attributed to}} individual <b>teachers.</b> If <b>the</b> students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is <b>said</b> to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is <b>said</b> to be ineffective.

5000|$|The problem, then, becomes evident: {{the massive}} {{education}} system cannot account for differences between its subjects, from different learning preferences to different teaching styles to different paces. Student-Directed Teaching asks, [...] "why do students {{all have to}} do the same thing, at the same time, in the same manner?" [...] It is because of this, according to the Student-Directed Teaching philosophy, that students lose faith in school: gifted students are not challenged enough while students that fall behind have little support. Thus, the public education system rewards those who remain in the middle: these are the students who receive praise because they never challenge <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> give textbook answers on homework and spit back cute phrases <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>said</b> yesterday. These are students who understand that challenging the status quo and being different carries a penalty.|$|R
