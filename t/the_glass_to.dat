5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above <b>the</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>to</b> symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
25|$|Strain {{cracking}} {{describes the}} presence of minuscule cracks running through the glass in all directions, giving it a sugary appearance and causing <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> disintegrate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't see a thing," [...] {{announced}} Roger, after a {{long look}} through the field-glasses. [...] "Here, you try," [...] and he handed <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> our hero.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say," [...] she answered. [...] "But I don't {{want to see}} any more," [...] {{and giving}} <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> her father, she climbed down the wall.|$|R
50|$|At the South Africa Pavilion, {{teams would}} find five wine bottles and five glasses of wine. Teams had <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottles {{to receive their}} next clue.|$|R
25|$|In closed systems the {{consumption}} of protons from the aqueous phase increases the pH and causes a fast transition to hydrolysis. However, a further saturation of solution with silica impedes hydrolysis and causes <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> return to an ion-exchange, e.g. diffusion-controlled regime of corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the glass}} inlays of the Gundestrup {{cauldron}} have been determined {{through the use}} of X-ray fluorescence radiation to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> between the second century BC and first century AD.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the stiffness of the molten glass, {{which in turn}} facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change {{in the composition of}} glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris of Israel, Fischer and McCray postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> be stiffer for blowing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are mainly}} two methods <b>to</b> {{manufacture}} <b>glass</b> flakes. One is bubble method. Firstly, melt <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> marble <b>to</b> liquid form, then blow <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> liquid <b>to</b> bubble by air; smash <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> flakes and sieve it to different particle size distribution. The other is centrifuge method, drop high-temperature liquid form <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> rotating tub, <b>glass</b> flakes would be spun off by centrifuge force.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Waddington!" [...] shouted Bertram, in a {{voice that}} caused <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> shake, and made the waiter turn round. And then {{suddenly}} recollecting himself, he scowled round the room as he observed that he was noticed.|$|R
6000|$|... "No harm done, madam," [...] said he, with {{a certain}} elocutionary correctness, and rather in the strong voice of the {{workshop}} than the subdued one of the drawing-room, handing <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> her ceremoniously as he spoke.|$|R
25|$|Brandy is {{traditionally}} served {{at room temperature}} (neat) from a snifter, a wine glass or a tulip glass. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating. Excessive heating of brandy may cause the alcohol vapour to become too strong, causing its aroma to become overpowering. Brandy drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> be heated before the brandy is poured.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as Cunife and Fernico) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These {{made it easy to}} construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, {{a pint of}} Guinness {{should be}} served in a {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 {{of the way up}} <b>the</b> <b>glass).</b> <b>To</b> begin the pour, the server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the tap and fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of the}} tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E

6000|$|... "On fire!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Lawrence, {{and raised}} <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> his eyes. [...] "By Jove, boys, I think you're right! Phil, call Captain Bradley, and be quick about it. You'll {{find him in}} the after cabin. I just left him there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me take a}} look," [...] {{suggested}} Tom Dillon, {{and adjusted}} <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> his eyes. [...] "You are right--they are three men on horses. But who they are I don't know. Plenty o' miners travel this trail {{at one time or}} another." ...|$|R
25|$|If a {{glass of}} water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will {{continue}} to absorb water and the cycle will continue {{as long as there is}} enough water in <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a perpetual motion machine.|$|E
25|$|National Museum was {{designed}} in Neo-Palladian and Renaissance style {{and consists of}} two rectangular parallel blocks, with a dome {{at the front of}} the building. Its architects were Henry McCallum who designed the original version and J.F. McNair who designed the scaled down version of the building. The building has two rotundas, a new glass-clad rotunda at the rear area of the building. Its glass rotunda is a cylindrical shaped building which is made up of two drums, with the outer one made of glass which sheaths an inner one made of wire mesh. Black out curtains has the same length of the inner drum with images projected on sixteen video projectors in the day. The curtains are drawn after sunset, and projection can be beamed out through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> get a view of the city. Coats of arms are found on the building's front.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> fail.|$|E
60|$|Dunn {{started out}} of a {{momentary}} abstraction, {{put his hand on}} his hip, and mechanically entered the house. They had scarcely raised <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> their lips when a sudden rattle of wheels was heard in the street.

500|$|On top of {{the tower}} is a {{bluestone}} gallery and balcony with gunmetal railings. The gallery has a painted cast iron floor grate with a cast iron stair leading to the outdoor gallery. The lantern room is atop this gallery, made of metal and glass, encircled and protected by perspex and aluminium panels. It has a decorative iron catwalk encircling <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> allow for cleaning. The lantern house is the original [...] Chance Bros. cast iron and copper lantern house, one of about 21 known to exist in Australia.|$|E
500|$|The {{morphology}} of ash {{particles from}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{is controlled by}} stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles. Vesicle shape and density play only a minor role in the determination of grain shape in phreatomagmatic eruptions. In this sort of eruption, the rising magma is quickly cooled on contact with ground or surface water. Stresses within the [...] "quenched" [...] magma cause fragmentation into five dominant pyroclast shape-types: (1) blocky and equant; (2) vesicular and irregular with smooth surfaces; (3) moss-like and convoluted; (4) spherical or drop-like; and (5) plate-like.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s were {{associated}} with aggressive, and often violent, play. [...] Known as the [...] "", the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this style. [...] The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes—Dave [...] "the Hammer" [...] Schultz's total of 472 in 1974–75 remains a league record—and ended up in courtrooms multiple times when players went into the stands to challenge fans who got involved. [...] One such incident occurred in Vancouver in December 1972, when a fan reached over <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> pull the hair of Don Saleski, who had a chokehold on Vancouver's Barry Wilkins. [...] Bobby Taylor and several Flyers teammates followed the fan into the stands. [...] The next time Philadelphia went to Vancouver, several players were brought before the courts on charges that ranged from use of obscene language to common assault. [...] Six players were fined, and Taylor received a 30-day suspended sentence. [...] Despite these incidents, the Flyers won: they captured the 1974 Stanley Cup, becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship, and repeated as champions in 1975.|$|E

5000|$|The first-order {{design of}} an achromat {{involves}} choosing the overall power [...] of the doublet and <b>the</b> two <b>glasses</b> <b>to</b> use. <b>The</b> choice of <b>glass</b> gives <b>the</b> mean refractive index, often written as [...] (for the refractive index at the Fraunhofer [...] "d" [...] spectral line wavelength), and the Abbe number [...] (for the reciprocal of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> dispersion). <b>To</b> make <b>the</b> linear dispersion {{of the system}} zero, the system must satisfy the equations ...|$|R

500|$|Stollard {{wished the}} {{butterflies}} {{to be as}} realistic as possible, and modeled them after mounted butterfly specimens his team studied. The butterflies were computer generated animations and added later in post-production. To {{create the illusion of}} Young falling through the window, the visual effects crew placed small explosive charges on the tempered glass window; Slocum's stuntman Jared Burke then jumped through while they triggered <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> explode. Two cameras, one high and one profile, were positioned to shoot the fall, and were composited together later into a matte painting of the World Trade Building. The fall was filmed multiple times with a green screen, with the stuntman falling on a cushion. While on-set, Toye explained of the shoot, [...] "with all the pieces put together with the visual effects and with the performance we got with our actor Ptolemy, it's going to be fabulous." [...] A crewman believed that the addition of music to Young's fall made the scene [...] "far more elegant and more of a statement." [...] In a December 2012 interview, actress Jasika Nicole stated that she developed a fear of butterflies {{as a result of this}} episode.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "fragmentation stage" [...] of crizzling is {{the final}} stage of {{deterioration}} and occurs when the structural integrity of the glass is no longer present causing <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>to</b> separate into pieces.: ...|$|E
2500|$|Canterbury Cathedral {{contains}} {{a greater number}} of early Gothic windows than any other English Cathedral.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>glass</b> frit bonding, {{starting}} with {{alignment of the}} wafers, is a thermo-compressive process {{that takes place in}} the bonding chamber at specific pressure. Under bonding pressure wafers are heated up to the process temperature around 430 °C for a few minutes. On the one hand a short bonding time causes <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> frit <b>to</b> spread insufficiently, on the other hand a longer bonding time causes <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> frit <b>to</b> be overflown subsequently leaving voids.|$|R
