5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as {{a good reason to}} dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E

5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya.

5|$|Historically, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> For {{most of its}} history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and {{was found in the}} correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, during United's 3–1 loss against Liverpool at Anfield, Nani {{was injured}} {{following}} a challenge from Jamie Carragher just before half-time.

Following post-match comments to the press from Manchester United, it was believed Nani had suffered a broken leg. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as he started training the following week.

5|$|Public {{perception}} in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> In 1832, Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence {{to cause the}} Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, {{to be held in}} Vienna, and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, the Viceroy accepted, backed fully by William.|$|E

5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers {{in two of the}} bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that it was a good breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders were very different from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Additionally, he showed {{that one of the}} three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E

5|$|Mathabar {{was given}} a grand welcome in Calcutta by the acting Governor-General Charles Metcalfe; and while there, Mathabar started to indulge in needless luxuries and show offs. Meanwhile, Hodgson sent a secret letter to Metcalfe asking him not to allow Mathabar to make a state visit to Britain. Hence, Metcalfe was only willing to grant him the visa of an {{ordinary}} traveler, and not the diplomatic visa of a state representative. Mathabar thus returned to Nepal in March 1836, having wasted a vast sum of money, without accomplishing any of his goals. The deliberate sabotage of Mathabar's mission was Hodgson's diplomatic attack against Bhimsen. Until that time, it was widely believed by both the royal family {{as well as the}} common people that Bhimsen's good relationship with the high ranking British officials, since {{he was the only one}} allowed to communicate with them, was responsible for preventing the East India Company to take full control of Nepal. The mission's failure unambiguously revealed to everyone that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> and severely undermined Bhimsen's political credibility. Mathabar's extravagant expenditure was also heavily criticized by Samrajya Laxmi, since at that time the state coffer was in dire condition; and to pacify her, Bhimsen had to reimburse the extra expenses from him own pockets.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery.
