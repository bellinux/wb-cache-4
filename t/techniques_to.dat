The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> establish ground truth and remote sensing <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.|$|E

5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery <b>techniques</b> <b>to</b> the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} a search-based <b>technique</b> <b>to</b> automatically syn-thesize sequences of method calls that are functionally {{equivalent to a}} given target method. This paper presents challenges and results of apply-ing our <b>technique</b> <b>to</b> Google Guava.

We modified our <b>technique</b> <b>to</b> cope with such challenges. The evaluation of the improved version of our technique shows that we can synthesize 188 equivalent method calls for relevant components of Guava, outperforming by 86 % the original version. ...|$|R
