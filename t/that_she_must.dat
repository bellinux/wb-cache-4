5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> {{stand up to}} her {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|Jean Brooks as Jacqueline Gibson, {{the elder}} sister of Mary Gibson. Jacqueline is Mary's only {{relative}} and {{was responsible for}} raising her. Characterized as a depressive, she {{was the owner of}} La Sagasse, a cosmetics company in Manhattan prior to her disappearance. Mary describes Jacqueline as tall and strikingly beautiful. After becoming involved with the Palladists and falling into a deep depression, Jacqueline confided in Dr. Judd about the cult. As a result of the cult's strict rules about secrecy, it is mandated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> die for revealing information about them.|$|E

5|$|Levin was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them. Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or be a father. She concluded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, Archbishop Szoka {{reported}} {{the situation to}} the Vatican. The Vatican delegated Archbishop Pio Laghi to address the matter, and he {{sent a message to}} Sister Theresa Kane, the national president of the Sisters of Mercy, telling Kane <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> convince Mansour to resign as director of DSS. Kane refused, as did Detroit Provincial Superior Emily George who was the Vice President of the Sisters of Mercy of the Union, and was previously (as Mary Karl George) the president of Mercy College, before Mansour.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E

5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> be confused.|$|E

They part ways for lunch, and Annie meets Silver (Jessica Stroup); however, Naomi pulls Annie away, explaining that Silver makes insulting YouTube videos about people. Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, who feel that Naomi {{should not have to}} hand in her assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school. Naomi receives a text message from her mother, telling her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> complete the assignment that night. Annie remembers that she completed a similar assignment for her old school, and offers to give Naomi a copy for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Emperor's palace, Faythe decides <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> see Gabriel again. Disguising herself, {{she begins}} to travel back to Ravenskill. Arabelle, knowing about her daughter's intentions, instructs Daryus to follow and protect her. Daryus feels {{he has always been}} {{overlooked}} by his father in favor of his sister, so he travels to the town with his own intentions ("A Life Left Behind"). Faythe arrives in the town and finds Xander, who trusts her and leads her to his father Arhys. Faythe convinces Arhys that she can help, so he brings her to Gabriel's hideout. Gabriel and Faythe embrace, and she tells him that she believes she can convince her father to give up his hunt for Gabriel ("Ravenskill"). Gabriel tells her that if he could just meet with the Emperor, he could inspire him to restore peace to the land using his gift of music ("Chosen").|$|E

5|$|Fumito, Itsuki and Yūka then confront them, with Fumito unleashing an Elder Bairn that brutally kills Nono, Nene and Shinichirō {{for their}} treachery. Saya saves Kanako from the Elder Bairn while killing it, but Kanako is then killed by Tadayoshi, {{revealed}} to be a human-Elder Bairn hybrid driven berserk by an overdose of Saya's blood given by Fumito. Saya—now back to her true self—is forced to kill Tadayoshi, and witnesses Fumito release an artificial Elder Bairn which slaughters the town's population before Saya kills it. Fumito's soldiers attempt to shoot Saya, but Itsuki sacrifices himself to save her as he had grown to love her. Fumito and Yūka—who participated so as to achieve political power with Fumito's help—escape on a helicopter. When Saya tries to stop them, Fumito shoots her. Recovering on the lakeside, Saya learns from the dog that her wish was to remain herself when in Fumito's experiment, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> now pursue her next wish. Saya sets off in pursuit of Fumito.|$|E
5|$|In {{later life}} she {{converted}} to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely {{retiring from the}} world. Even in her eighties, however, she was still active in the literary world, entertaining female artists such as Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake {{after the collapse of}} the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so it is evident <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have died before this date.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{learns that}} her {{apartment}} building is being {{converted into a}} condominium and is told <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> purchase her apartment or face a rent increase. She decides {{that she wants to}} buy her apartment and the one above her, and turn them into her dream home. When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming. However, she decides to adopt this behavior to force Brian to leave; she is successful.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a certain}} degree of pride and {{importance}} about being wanted by one's lawyers in such a monstrous hurry, that was by no means displeasing to Mrs. Bardell, especially as it might be reasonably supposed to enhance her consequence {{in the eyes of the}} first-floor lodger. She simpered a little, affected extreme vexation and hesitation, and at last arrived at the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>she</b> supposed <b>she</b> <b>must</b> go.|$|R
5|$|Princess Elsa of Arendelle {{possesses}} cryokinetic magic, often {{using it}} to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa’s magic, warning Elsa <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{partnership}} with Gilbert {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer, eventually succeeding {{with the help of}} Tom Chappell, their music publisher. Their next opera, Utopia Limited (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her, while Gilbert insisted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. The Chieftain (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, The Contrabandista, flopped. Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for The Grand Duke (1896). This also failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

5|$|With Brisbane {{unable to}} provide any {{rational}} explanation for Shaw's condition her family and their local parish minister concluded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> be possessed and being tormented by witches, a common occurrence in England and Scotland and a central element in the Salem witch trials a few years earlier. The church set up a weekly fast and prayer meeting at Bargarron House, and Shaw's father appealed to the authorities that those named by his daughter as tormenting her should be arrested. She had initially identified only Catherine Campbell and Agnes Naismith, but as time wore on she implicated others, and eventually 35 were accused. Ten were male and twenty female; the genders and identities of the remaining five are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, {{whether or not they}} were destined for a career in the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E
