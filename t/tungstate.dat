The FT-IR spectra obtained during the interaction of CO with NO x species adsorbed on the Au/ZrO 2 -WO x and Au/ZrO 2 samples revealed the formation of surface isocyanates attached to the gold particles. The generation of Au-NCO species occurred at low temperature (25 - 50 °C). The W-containing sample was characterized by higher activity in the ad-NO x + CO reaction than the W-free one. It is shown that the nitrate species or adsorbed NO 2 are essential for the generation of surface isocyanates and the oxidation of NO by oxygen is an important step.

25|$|The ECAL is {{constructed}} from crystals of lead <b>tungstate,</b> PbWO4. This {{is an extremely}} dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead <b>tungstate</b> crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but {{with a touch of}} oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and scintillates when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle’s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a radiation length of χ0=0.89cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22mm×22mm and a depth of 230mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon avalanche photodiodes for readout.|$|E

25|$|In 1895, Thomas Edison {{investigated}} materials' {{ability to}} fluoresce {{when exposed to}} X-rays, and found that calcium <b>tungstate</b> was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, even before the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally {{had a habit of}} testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Thomas Edison began {{investigating}} materials for ability to fluoresce when X-rayed, {{and by the}} turn of the century he had invented a fluoroscope with sufficient image intensity to be commercialized. Edison had quickly discovered that calcium <b>tungstate</b> screens produced brighter images. Edison, however, abandoned his researches in 1903 because of the health hazards that accompanied use of these early devices. Clarence Dally, a glass blower of lab equipment and tubes at Edison’s laboratory was repeatedly exposed, suffering radiation poisoning, later succumbing to an aggressive cancer. Edison himself damaged an eye in testing these early fluoroscopes.|$|E
25|$|While Becquerel was {{interested}} primarily in conducting scientific research into fluorescence, Thomas Edison briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential. He invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of calcium <b>tungstate</b> as the fluorescing substance, excited by X-rays, but although it received a patent in 1907, {{it was not}} put into production. As with a few other attempts to use Geissler tubes for illumination, it had a short operating life, and given {{the success of the}} incandescent light, Edison had little reason to pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination. Nikola Tesla made similar experiments in the 1890s, devising high-frequency powered fluorescent bulbs that gave a bright greenish light, but as with Edison's devices, no commercial success was achieved.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>tungstated</b> zirconia catalysts with different tungsten loadings and calcination temperatures for liquid-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to ε-caprolactam was studied and {{the relation of}} their activity with the structure of tungsten species on zirconia surface was investigated. Cyclohexanone was the major product when zirconia {{was used as the}} catalyst while ε-caprolactam was formed in major amounts with <b>tungstated</b> zirconia. The relative amounts of these products depended on the W surface density, and the maximum selectivity to ε-caprolactam was observed at tungsten loadings near that required for the formation of a monolayer. UV−visible absorption edge energies suggested that the surface contains polytungstate species at these loadings. These polytungstate domains create Brønsted acid centers on the surface, as suggested by acidity measurements using NH 3 adsorption microcalorimetry and FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, thereby making the <b>tungstated</b> zirconia catalysts active for the formation of ε-caprolactam...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the neon light also was significant for the last key element of the fluorescent lamp, its fluorescent coating. In 1926 Jacques Risler received a French patent {{for the application of}} fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes. The main use of these lamps, which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents, was for advertising, not general illumination. This, however, was not the first use of fluorescent coatings; Becquerel had earlier used the idea and Edison used calcium <b>tungstate</b> for his unsuccessful lamp. Other efforts had been mounted, but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems. Of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage “metal vapor lamp” by Friedrich Meyer, Hans-Joachim Spanner, and Edmund Germer, who were employees of a German firm in Berlin. A German patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium <b>tungstate)</b> fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
