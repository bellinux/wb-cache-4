Gregg of Colorado, U.S. Waugh, W. Newburg, Morris Newberger, F.A. Cromwell, C.M. Webb, Adeline Webb, U.E. Methaver, {{and several other}} of Gregg's associates living in California from disposing of 200,000 shares of the oil company's stock, valued at $1 a share at the time, which, it was alleged, was secured by the defendants through [...] "trickery and fraud." [...] Gregg and the other defendants held 200,000 shares of the 219,965 shares of the issued capital stock of the Pacific Sunset oil company. [...] It is said {{that in order to}} trade off the 200,000 shares of the Pacific Sunset stock for an equal amount in the Boston Pacific company, Gregg and the other defendants, among other things, filled an oil reservoir on the Pacific Sunset oil company's fifty acres of leased land in Kern county, which contained 3,400 barrels of oil, with water so as to make it appear that the reservoir held between 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil. [...] When negotiations began, Gregg and his associates asserted there were four wells on the property each of which was producing 70 barrels of oil per day; and that the <b>total</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the Pacific Sunset Oil Company, which it was proposed that BPOC should take over, did not exceed $10,000; that the sump contained between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil and that the company had an option to purchase the leased land for $80,000 ($2 million in 2016). The complaint stated that each of the four wells produced only 17 to 20 barrels of actual oil the day of the investigation when inspected by a representative of Fillius, and that the wells had not been worked for some period previous to the time they were inspected, so that the 70 barrels pumped [...] "the day of" [...] the investigation was actually the accumulation of several days of pumping; that the sump contained only 3,600 barrels of oil, not 25,000-30,000 (the remainder of the fluid in the reserves being water poured in by the defendants); and that the company held no option to purchase the land they had leased for $80,000. [...] The complaint also indicated that the liabilities of the Pacific Sun Oil Company amounted to $23,304. Another charge contained in the complaint was the Gregg said the Pacific Sunset company had an agreement with the Independent Oil Producers' agency whereby the latter agreed to take all the oil the former should sell at $0.55 ($13.50 in 2016) a barrel, whereas no such agreement existed.|$|E
