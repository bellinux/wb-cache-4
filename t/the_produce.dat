5|$|According to the chronicles of the Hindu monastic institution, the Kanchi matha, the matha was {{temporarily}} transferred to Kumbakonam in the 1780s following {{an invasion of}} Kanchipuram by Hyder Ali of Mysore. When Tipu Sultan invaded {{the east coast of}} South India in 1784, Kumbakonam bore the brunt of his invasion. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> fell sharply and the economy collapsed. Kumbakonam did not recover from the calamity till the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined in Ashton {{since at least}} the 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, which led to an {{expansion}} of the town's coal industry. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss Colliery was still operational, the last colliery to be opened in the area.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{is derived}} from the Old English leah which meant a place at the wood or {{woodland}} clearing, a glade and subsequently a pasture or meadow, it was spelt Legh in 1276. Other recorded spellings include Leech, 1264; Leeche, 1268; Leghthe, 1305; Leght, 1417; Lech, 1451; Legh, 16th century. As its name denotes it was a district rich in meadow and pasture land, and <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> of its dairies, the Leigh cheese, was formerly noted for its excellence.|$|E

5|$|Siddhaya was a {{local tax}} levied on {{agriculture}} and pottondi was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, pottondi also meant 1/10, aydalavi meant 1/5 and elalavi meant 1/7. Mannadare literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (Kurimbadere) payable to the chief of shepherds. Bhaga meant a portion or share of <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as Kirudere (due to the landlords) and samathadere (raised by the army officers or samantha) are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles. Bittuvatta or niravari taxes comprised usually of a percentage of <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E
5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> in the shade.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringGas {{condensate}} {{flow behaviour}} below {{the dew point}} in low permeable formations can make accurate fluid sampling a difficult challenge. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> oil-gas ratio behaviour in the infinite-acting period for a low permeable gas condensate reservoir. Compositional isothermal flow simulations were performed using a single-layer, radial and two-dimensional, gas condensate reservoir model with low permeability. The main finding in this thesis was that during a drawdown for long <b>producing</b> times, <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> oil-gas ratio quickly stabilized below the initial oil-gas ratio and remained almost constant throughout the infinite-acting period. The stabilization level of <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> oil-gas ratio depended on <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> rate. No previous work on the observations in this thesis has been found. A sensitivity study using two other sets of gas-oil relative permeability curves was performed, but no significant change in <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> oil-gas ratio behaviour was observed. The conclusion is that a recombined oil and gas PVT-sample from a low permeable gas condensate field could be inaccurate if the stabilized level of <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> oil-gas ratio is different from the initial oil-gas ratio...|$|R

The monastery has administrative control over two dzongs, each {{headed by a}} monk; the Darana Dzong built in 1831 and the Sanglem Dzong, also known as Talung Gompa, in the south west part of Kameng district. These dzongs not only collect taxes but also preach Buddhism to the Monpas and Sherdukpens of Kameng. The monastery owns cultivable lands in the villages of Soma and Nerguit and a few patches in some other villages which are tilled and cultivated by farmers, who share <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> with the monastery.

25|$|The second tithe is a {{distinct}} tithing obligation of 10% of <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> after terumah and the first tithe were separated. If any of these tithes were not separated, <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> was known as tevel and forbidden for consumption. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> was required to separate tithe, of any kind, after the particular kind of produce was finished in its common preparation for ingathering. Unlike the first tithe, the second tithe was only separated on the first, second, fourth and fifth years of the sabbatical year cycle. The poor tithe was separated on the third and sixth years. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> was required to be maintained {{in a state of}} purity and eaten in a state of purity in Jerusalem, at any time of the year. If the owner did not desire, or was unable to, bring <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> to Jerusalem, he was entitled to redeem <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> on a coin of equal value, in addition to adding a fifth to the value. The ability to redeem produce on money results in money which is mikudash (sacred, as earmarked for Temple purposes), while <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> became desanctified and available for any use. The money could only be used for limited categories of use in keeping with its sacred status. Improper spending of the money was forbidden.|$|E
