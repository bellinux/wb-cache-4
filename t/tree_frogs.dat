5|$|The chapter {{ends with}} a {{discussion}} of animals that can change colour, including fish like the sole, the chameleon, the horned lizards and the <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. The springs and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific <b>tree</b> <b>frogs,</b> and long-toed salamanders.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and <b>tree</b> <b>frogs.</b> It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E
5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. <b>Tree</b> <b>frogs</b> and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
50|$|The Australian green <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> simply green <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> in Australia, White's <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> or dumpy <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Litoria caerulea) is {{a species}} of <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> native to Australia and New Guinea, with {{introduced}} populations in the United States and New Zealand, though the latter {{is believed to have}} died out. The species belongs to the genus Litoria. It is morphologically similar to some other members of the genus, particularly the magnificent <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. splendida) and the white-lipped <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. infrafrenata).|$|R

5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific <b>tree</b> <b>frogs,</b> and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>frogs,</b> of {{the family}} Hylidae, {{are one of the}} major {{families}} in Australia, with over 70 species. The <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> are split into three genera: Cyclorana, Litoria and Nyctimystes. The <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> of Australia have various habits, from completely arboreal to fossorial.|$|E

25|$|Fossil data {{suggests}} the <b>tree</b> <b>frogs,</b> {{of the family}} Hylidae, originated in South America after its separation from Africa. Outside Australia, <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> are widespread throughout much of North and South America, Europe and Asia. <b>Tree</b> <b>frogs</b> presumably migrated to Australia via Antarctica.
