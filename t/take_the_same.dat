5|$|Alabama {{likewise}} underwent {{rumors of}} coaching changes. Shortly after the Music City Bowl matchup was announced, rumors spread that quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs or tight ends coach Ronnie Cottrell were {{being considered for}} other jobs. One departure rumor became reality when defensive line coach Jackie Shipp resigned to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position at the University of Oklahoma. Shipp's departure left the Crimson Tide without a defensive line coach, and Alabama head coach Mike DuBose filled the vacancy for the Music City Bowl.|$|E

Middleton was impressed with Kennedy's coaching acumen and chose to remain an Aggie. He was listed on the preseason watchlist for the Wooden Award.

5|$|Public {{perception}} in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This {{was not the}} case. In 1832, Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, {{to be held in}} Vienna, and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, the Viceroy accepted, backed fully by William.|$|E
5|$|Several coaches {{from each}} team were fired or {{moved on to}} other jobs in the offseason {{following}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless resigned to become the defensive coordinator at Rutgers University. Tech defensive line coach Todd Grantham was replaced by Charley Wiles after Grantham resigned to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> job at Michigan State. To prevent Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer from likewise seeking a different position, the school signed him to a new five-year contract at a salary of more than $148,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} {{worse than the}} national average during the regular season. The Hokies were ranked No. 64 in total offense, averaging 374.09 yards per game. In particular, Tech's passing offense was lacking. That segment of the offense was ranked No. 86, averaging 179.36 yards. This figure was somewhat balanced by the Hokies' rushing attack, which was ranked No. 55 (194.73 ypg). Despite the worse-than-average yardage totals, Tech was ranked No. 25 in scoring offense, or 32.64 points per game. Prior to the Gator Bowl, it was announced that Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle would be leaving the team to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position at the Louisiana-Lafayette. Despite the move, he confirmed he would coach the Hokies during the bowl game in his last act as a Virginia Tech coach.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Hammond {{increased}} his first-class wicket total to 47, and scored 1,781 runs {{at an average}} of 42.40. Although he remained a key batsman for Gloucestershire, both his aggregate and average fell, at least partly due to wet weather that often led to difficult batting conditions. In the three Tests against New Zealand, their first in England, he made an attacking century in the second Test, England's only victory. He did not pass fifty {{in the rest of the}} series, ending the victorious campaign with 169 runs {{at an average of}} 56.33. In 1932, Hammond was appointed vice-captain of Gloucestershire, but it was noted in Wisden that he sometimes failed to inspire his team. Hammond himself felt unable, as a new captain, to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> risks that Lyon had done. He scored 2,528 runs (average 56.17), including his then highest score of 264, and his first hundred for the Players against the Gentlemen. He also took 53 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the knee}} injury, Croyle {{received}} interest from members the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, including Louisiana State and Florida State. Croyle showed interest in playing for Florida State {{due in part}} because of the team's offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. Croyle initially showed little interest in playing for Alabama after their head coach, Mike DuBose had recently been fired, but once Richt took the head coaching job with the Georgia Bulldogs, Croyle followed in his father's footsteps. On the night before he was to announce his college decision to play for Florida State, Croyle announced that he would instead play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Interestingly enough, the Crimson Tide were not fazed by Croyle’s rather serious ligament tear, for they felt he would heal well enough that his talent still warranted a spot on the roster. Croyle graduated early from high school and enrolled at the University of Alabama in January 2001. After red-shirting his freshman year at Alabama, Croyle earned a spot as the top backup in his second season behind senior starter Tyler Watts. Croyle's coaches voted for him as the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman after starting two games in 2002. After the 2002 season, Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione resigned to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position at Texas A. Washington State head coach Mike Price was hired to replace Franchione in January 2003.|$|E
