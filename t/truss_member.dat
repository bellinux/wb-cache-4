Giving one member a larger cross section than on a previous iteration requires giving other members a larger cross section as well, to hold the greater weight of the first member—one needs to go through another iteration to find exactly how much greater the other members need to be. Sometimes the designer goes through several iterations of the design process to converge on the [...] "right" [...] cross section for each member.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this research}} was to apply methods of vibrations testing {{in order to determine}} axial loads in the pin-ended <b>truss</b> <b>members</b> of the Breeding Bam. This method of vibrations testing was necessary {{in order to determine the}} in-situ axial loads of the <b>truss</b> <b>members</b> in the bam. Other common methods, such as strain gauges, were not useful for this application. This is because strain gauges can only detect changes in strain and therefore only changes in load. However due to the size and weight of the roof at the Breeding Bam, significant axial loads are produced in the <b>truss</b> <b>members.</b> This in-situ axial load due to the dead load of the roof is a significant portion of any additional loading and cannot be ignored. The ultimate goal of determining the axial loads in the <b>truss</b> <b>members</b> was to develop a model for the roof structure of the bam that accurately predicts axial loads in the <b>truss</b> <b>members</b> over a range of loading conditions. Developing such a model was important in order to make a structural assessment ofthe Breeding Bam's roof structure. In order to determine the axial loads in the <b>truss</b> <b>members,</b> acceleration tim...|$|R

5000|$|In physics, tension {{describes}} the pulling force transmitted axially {{by means of}} a string, cable, chain, or similar one-dimensional continuous object, or by each end of a rod, <b>truss</b> <b>member,</b> or similar three-dimensional object; tension can also be described as the action-reaction pair of forces acting at each end of said elements.

5000|$|Tension is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the force exerted by the ends of a three-dimensional, continuous material such as a rod or <b>truss</b> <b>member.</b> Such a rod elongates under tension. The amount of elongation and the load that will cause failure both depend on the force per cross-sectional area rather than the force alone, so stress = axial force / cross sectional area is more useful for engineering purposes than tension. Stress is a 3x3 matrix called a tensor, and the [...] element of the stress tensor is tensile force per area, or compression force per area, denoted as a negative number for this element, if the rod is being compressed rather than elongated.|$|E

40|$|The damper {{placement}} problem for large flexible space truss structures is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. The {{objective is to}} determine the p <b>truss</b> <b>members</b> of the structure to replace with active (or passive) dampers so that the modal damping ratio is as large as possible for all significant modes of vibration. Equivalently, given a strain energy matrix with rows indexed on the modes and the columns indexed on the <b>truss</b> <b>members,</b> we seek to find the set of p columns such that the smallest row sum, over the p columns, is maximized.

50|$|As well {{as being}} one of the first iron railway bridges, the bridge is the first to use the {{lenticular}} truss design. This design uses two curved girders in a lens shape, one above and one below. The upper member is in compression, as for an arch bridge, and the lower in tension, as for a suspension bridge. The idea is that this forms a balanced truss, where the sideways forces in each member cancel out, being equal but opposite in direction. This leads to a truss with no side forces on its supports and so only requiring simple piers with no need for endways stiffness. Vertical members connect the two girders and support the load-carrying deck of the bridge. These vertical members must also transfer some load between the two girders, as to maintain their lens shape. An efficient truss distributes the load of the deck between the two girders, rather than placing the majority of the load on one <b>truss</b> <b>member,</b> and so requiring it to be excessively strong compared to the other.|$|E

One end-effector is dedicated to <b>truss</b> <b>member</b> insertion, while a second end-effector is used to install panels. Until recently, the robot motions required to construct the structure were developed iteratively using the facility hardware. Recent work at Langley has resulted in a compact machine vision system capable of providing position information relative to targets on the structure. Use of the vision system to guide the robot from an approach point 10 to 18 inches from the structure, offsetting model inaccuracies, permits robot motion based on calculated points as a first step toward use of preplanned paths from an automated path planner.

40|$|This article numerically investigates dynamic {{stiffness}} versus strength trades of imperfect passive and active trusses that fail in local elastic-stability modes and {{are relevant to}} space vehicle programs. Design scaling laws are derived {{in the presence of}} member straightness or eccentricity imperfections as well as sensor and actuator noise. These two imperfections are each characterized as a statistical uncertainty. Reliability-based design optimization techniques are employed to propagate the uncertainty distributions. Unlike previous studies, design decision points are probabilistically understood, e. g., when it is favorable to integrate active control. Member eccentricity statistical characterizations either position the active control favorability decision point at approximately 10 % compensator mass fraction or shift the point to many multiples of this fraction. The former decision point occurs if eccentricity scales with <b>truss</b> <b>member</b> length and the latter decision points occur if eccentricity scales with <b>truss</b> <b>member</b> radius. Further, a previously discovered dynamically distinct high-authority control regime is shown to exist irrespective of truss topology and connectivity. An active control power term accurately predicts the pivotal compensator power rates delineating this regime’s feasibility. These predictions are statisticall...|$|E
