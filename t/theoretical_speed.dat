50|$|Minguzzi {{scrambled}} for {{the first}} time in the Sagittario on 24 March, when Naples was attacked and on 2 April he claimed a four-engined B-24 Liberator bomber over the Isle of Ischia. This claim is not verified against corresponding USAAF losses. Italian ace Vittorio Minguzzi was impressed by this aircraft following its tests and combat debut on 2 April 1943. He wrote: The aircraft is in ideal flying conditions at an altitude of 7,000-7,500 meters and can make repeated attacks on American heavy bombers in all positions and from all directions... I can therefore say that the speed and handling qualities are excellent even at 7,000 meters and that compared to the Macchi 202, the Sagittario made two attacks in the time required by the Macchi C.202 for a single pass. This statement provides a realistic comparison between the two aircraft: in terms of <b>theoretical</b> <b>speed,</b> the Macchi C.202 was only 30 km/h slower, but the Re.2005's DB-605, coupled with its larger wing, provided a substantial improvement in performance at high altitude (the difference was less marked at medium-to-low altitudes, as the comparison with the C.205V showed).
