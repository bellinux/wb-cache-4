5|$|In 1949, Gian Carlo Menotti was {{commissioned}} by NBC's Opera Theatre to write an opera for television. After {{a year and a}} half of delay, he set to work, completing Amahl and the Night Visitors five days before its scheduled airing on Christmas Eve 1951 at 9:30 to 10:30p.m.. Menotti's work was inspired by Hieronymous Bosch's painting, The Adoration of the Magi. The composer himself appeared on-screen to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers on-camera to <b>thank</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the members}} of the brigade began to return to Australia after the war, he became {{increasingly}} depressed. Eventually, he called a parade to hand out some last medals, and gave them a farewell speech to <b>thank</b> <b>them</b> for upholding his demanding standards. They were then dismissed and he returned to his paperwork. Later that afternoon, the brigade returned to his chateau preceded by bands and colours. Each company circled the chateau and cheered for their commander. Lastly, the senior colonel called for three cheers and told Elliott that the men wanted to show their appreciation for him and that, despite it being a voluntary march, everyone was there. He was mentioned in despatches twice more, and awarded the French Croix de guerre.|$|E
5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation. Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to <b>thank</b> <b>them,</b> but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E

5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower.

5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to <b>thank</b> <b>them</b> for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E

25|$|Women in pre-modern society {{were seen}} as bearers of children, {{retailers}} of fish, and farmers. Within the traditional sphere, the childbearing ability of women was explained as {{the means by which}} lineage ancestors were allowed to be reborn.

In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was seen as a traditional means for parents to be acknowledged for taking good care of their daughters.

Notable political personalities include Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as a host of past and current political office holders. This renaissance {{is a direct result of}} the efforts put in by Ghana's vibrant civil society. Women have since risen to positions of professional importance in southern Ghana.|$|E
