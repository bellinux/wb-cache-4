5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant.

5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule’s dose limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The study {{describes}} {{the conditions for}} long-term preservation {{of the content of}} <b>the</b> institutional <b>repositories</b> of Swedish higher education institutions based on an investigation of how deposited files are managed with regards to file format and how representatives of <b>the</b> <b>repositories</b> describe <b>the</b> functions of <b>the</b> <b>repositories.</b> Method. <b>The</b> findings are based on answers to a questionnaire completed by thirty-four institutional repository representatives (97 % response rate). Analysis. Questionnaire answers were analysed through descriptive statistics and qualitative coding. The concept of information infrastructures was used to analytically discuss repository work. Results. Visibility and access to content were considered {{to be the most important}} functions of <b>the</b> <b>repositories,</b> but long-term preservation was also considered important for publications and student theses. Whereas a majority of repositories had some form of guidelines for which file formats were accepted, very few considered whether or not file formats constitute open standards. This can have consequences for the long-term sustainability and access of the content deposited in <b>the</b> <b>repositories.</b> Conclusion. <b>The</b> study contributes to the discussion about the sustainability of research publications and data in <b>the</b> <b>repositories</b> by pointing to the potential difficulties involved for long-term preservation and access when there is little focus on and awareness of open file formats.

5|$|The Godesburg {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid on 15 October 1210 upon {{the order of}} Dietrich of Hengebach, the Archbishop of Cologne, who was himself in disputed possession of the Electorate and fighting to keep his position. Although his competitors deposed Dietrich in 1212, his successors finished and enlarged the fortress; it featured in chronicles of the subsequent centuries as both a symbolic and physical embodiment {{of the power of}} the archbishop of Cologne in his many struggles for regional authority in secular and ecclesiastical matters. Furthermore, by the late 14th century, the fortress had become <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> of the Elector's valuables and archives. By the mid-16th century, with the inclusion of residential facilities, the castle was popularly considered the Lieblingssitz, or the favorite seat (home), of the Electors.|$|E

The tower is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area. The bottom four floors form the library as well as <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> for some relics of Gautama Buddha.

5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. The proximity of <b>the</b> <b>repository</b> to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E

5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach <b>the</b> <b>repository.</b> The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Some {{relatively}} large memorials were constructed during the war. The largest nagelfiguren was {{a statue of}} General Hindenburg, famous for his victory over the Russians in Prussia {{at the battle of}} Tannenberg; the 12 m tall statue was put up in Berlin, complete with scaffolding to allow participants to reach the statue and hammer nails in. By the end of the war, architects in Germany already considering how to commemorate the dead. A large, temporary memorial shrine was built in Hyde Park in August 1918, with over 100,000 visitors in its first week: it lasted over a year. The Hyde Park shrine encouraged debate in Britain about permanent war memorials in the major cities and towns.

5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into <b>the</b> <b>repository,</b> and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E
