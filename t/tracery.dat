5|$|The {{exterior}} of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since {{the greater part}} of the building was executed in a single style, Early English Gothic. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles. At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple <b>tracery,</b> the construction of a parapet that encircles the roof, and the addition of pinnacles framing each gable, similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front. At the eastern end there is a proliferation of <b>tracery</b> with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric and Flowing Decorated <b>tracery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the <b>tracery</b> is Geometric or Curvilinear. Many cathedrals have important {{parts in the}} Geometric style of the mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of <b>tracery</b> evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes {{as can be seen in}} the windows of the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|With its rhythmic {{arrangement}} of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, {{the exterior of}} Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which is an unusual feature as England's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. Close examination reveals window <b>tracery</b> of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16thcentury. The richness of the 13th-century <b>tracery</b> is accentuated {{by the presence of}} ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.|$|E
50|$|In Northern Europe, <b>traceries</b> only {{supported}} stained glass. In contrast, <b>traceries</b> in Venetian Gothic {{supported the}} weight of the entire building. Therefore, the relative weight sustained by the <b>traceries</b> alludes to the relative weightlessness of the buildings as a whole. This (and the associated reduced use of weight-bearing walls) gives the Venetian Gothic architectural style lightness and grace in structure.|$|R
50|$|There is a tower on {{the north}} {{west side of the}} church and the church is made of Bargate stone. The top of the tower is crenellated and there is a porch under the tower. There is a <b>traceried</b> window above the entrance. The transepts are gabled and also have <b>traceried</b> windows. Above the chancel is a five-bay <b>traceried</b> window.|$|R
50|$|The Perpendicular {{windows are}} mostly of the 3-light variety, {{though there is}} a 4-light east window. A <b>traceried</b> Perpendicular window is located above a doorway while other <b>traceried</b> windows are located at the church's upper stage. The chancel's east window is adorned with bosses.|$|R
5|$|The large chancel was {{restored}} around 1475, primarily {{it would appear}} by extending it and adding new red sandstone Perpendicular segmental-pointed side windows, one three-light and one single-light {{to the south and}} one three-light to the north – all now with nineteenth century <b>tracery</b> and stained glass. The window is Gothic equilateral.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1092 and {{completed}} in the early 15th century, Carlisle Cathedral is one of England’s smallest cathedrals since the demolition of its nave by the Scottish Presbyterian Army in 1649. Its most significant feature is its nine-light Flowing Decorated east window of 1322, still containing medieval glass in its upper sections, forming a “glorious termination to the choir” and regarded by many as having the finest <b>tracery</b> in England.|$|E
5|$|No {{architectural}} drawings {{survive for}} any English cathedral earlier than 1525 (although an engineer's {{design for a}} proposed new water supply at Canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th-century plan). Architectural details, such as window <b>tracery</b> designs, were not executed as scale drawings, but were incised full-size onto a large flat gypsum tracing-floor, examples of which survive at York and Wells.|$|E
60|$|The reader may {{perhaps have}} been {{surprised}} at the small attention given to <b>traceries</b> {{in the course of}} the preceding volumes: but the reason is, that there are no complicated <b>traceries</b> at Venice belonging to the good Gothic time, with the single exception of those of the Casa Cicogna; and the magnificent arcades of the Ducal Palace Gothic are so simple as to require little explanation.|$|R

50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} St Dunstan is about 2/5 mi {{southwest}} of the current village. The earliest part of the present building is the 13th-century chancel. The chancel arch {{and three of the}} nave windows are 14th-century, including a three-light Decorated Gothic <b>traceried</b> one on the south side. But most of the nave is now Perpendicular Gothic, including two transomed and <b>traceried</b> windows on the north side.|$|R

Another daughter Osella was the dam of Grosser Preis von Baden winner Ossian and Preis der Diana winner Ostrea.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is mainly 14thcentury although the east {{wall of the}} chancel contains remnants of 12th-century material, including two clamped buttresses. The ashlar-faced tower is 14thcentury with angled buttresses north and south. The west window has three lights with flowing <b>tracery.</b> The clock on the east face of the tower, dated 1876, is by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire, the oldest firm of tower clockmakers in the world; it is wound weekly by the churchwardens.|$|E
5|$|The cloisters {{were built}} in the late 13th century and largely rebuilt from 1430 to 1508 and have wide {{openings}} divided by mullions and transoms, and <b>tracery</b> in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The vault has lierne ribs that form octagons at the centre of each compartment, the joints of each rib having decorative bosses. The eastern range is of two storeys, of which the upper is the library built in the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|The kitchen {{block was}} {{added in the}} late 15th century or early 16th century and has no direct {{connection}} {{with the rest of}} the house. The Solar Block is the oldest part of the building dating from around 1250. It has a plate <b>tracery</b> window with a Trefoil cusping surrounded by wall paintings. The solar separated from the hall by a screens passage.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} Curvilinear or Flowing Decorated Gothic, is {{expressed}} in <b>tracery</b> of very varied and highly complex forms. Many {{of the largest and}} most famous windows of England date from 1320–30 and are in this style. They include the south transept rose window known as the “Bishop’s Eye” at Lincoln, the “Heart of Yorkshire” window in the west end of York and the famous nine-light east window of Carlisle.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's <b>tracery</b> has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of <b>tracery</b> filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} {{windows on the}} south side of the nave; the one to the west of the porch is set in a pointed frame, and the others are in square frames. The middle and easternmost of the five date {{originally}} from the 15th century but have been repositioned; the other three are 19th-century. On the north side, there is a pointed doorway from the early 14th century, with a 19th-century window to the west and two repositioned 15th-century windows with two lights (sections of window separated by mullions) to the east. The west wall has a repositioned 15th-century window. The chancel's east window is also 15th-century, with three lights headed by trefoils (a three-leaf pattern) and decorated with <b>tracery.</b> It has 19th-century glass depicting the Ascension. The south side of the chancel and the north transept have 19th-century windows; the south chancel window has three lights with <b>tracery</b> headed by cinquefoils (a five-leaf pattern), with geometric patterns of glass.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular <b>tracery.</b> After {{a long period of}} use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on staddle stones to prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The <b>tracery</b> and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E

50|$|Woodward Avenue Presbyterian is an English Gothic-style church, {{faced with}} rough rock and trimmed with a {{contrasting}} limestone, and measuring 184 feet long by 104 feet wide. The Woodward Avenue façade boasts a massive carved-stone entrance with a <b>traceried</b> stained glass window set above; two square towers flank the center entrance. Along the side, gabled transepts contain full-height <b>traceried</b> windows. A two-story educational wing, {{built at the}} same time as the main church building, abuts the rear. A lantern dome, raised above the roofline, lights the auditorium.|$|R
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, {{originally}} built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. This curved brick and timber building {{is said to have been}} designed to resemble the shape of a fetlock, one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular <b>tracery.</b> As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of <b>tracery</b> is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before her}} death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. In the year following, Oliver was amongst 60 artists {{profiled}} in Sonia Payes' book Untitled: Portraits of Australian Artists, while in 2008 her final works {{were included in}} the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art. The secondary art market, meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when Skein (2004) went under the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled <b>Tracery.</b> In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver.|$|E
6000|$|... § CIV. Yet, {{in saying}} that the French Gothic repeats one idea, I mean merely that it depends too much upon the {{foliation}} of its <b>traceries.</b> The disposition of the <b>traceries</b> themselves is endlessly varied and inventive; and indeed, {{the mind of the}} French workman was, perhaps, even richer in fancy than that of the Italian, only he had been taught a less noble style. This is especially to be remembered with respect to the subordination of figure sculpture above noticed as characteristic of the later Gothic.|$|R
