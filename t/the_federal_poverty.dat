5|$|One of {{the causes}} of insurer losses is the lower income, older and sicker enrollee population. One 2016 {{analysis}} reported that while 81% of the population with incomes from 100-150% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> level signed up, only 45% of those from 150-200% did so. The percentage continued to decline as income rose: 2% of those above 400% enrolled.|$|E
5|$|Households {{with incomes}} between 100% and 400% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> level were {{eligible}} to receive federal subsidies for policies purchased via an exchange. Subsidies are provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credits. Additionally, {{small businesses are}} eligible for a tax credit provided that they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace. Under the law, workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies via the exchanges. To be eligible the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker's household income.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> level. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> level will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E
