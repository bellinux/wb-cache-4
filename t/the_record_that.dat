5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>that</b> defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>that</b> King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Howling Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. Howling Bells were impressed by his style of work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions very natural. The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people, made <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>that</b> they wanted, and hoped that it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} shortfall {{caused by}} the crisis seems to have led to recruitment of barbarians to the auxilia on a much greater scale than previously. By the 4th century, {{it has been estimated}} that some 25% of regular army recruits were barbarian-born. In the elite palatini regiments anywhere between a third and a half of recruits may have been barbarian. This is likely a much greater proportion of foreigners than joined the auxilia in the 1st and 2nd centuries. In the 3rd century, a small number of regular auxiliary units appear in <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>that,</b> for the first time, bear the names of barbarian tribes from outside the empire e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain. This was probably an offshoot of the 5,500 surrendered Sarmatian horsemen posted on Hadrian's Wall by emperor Marcus Aurelius in c. 175. This unit may be an early example of a novel process whereby irregular units of barbari (foederati) were transformed into regular auxilia. This process intensified in the 4th century: the Notitia Dignitatum, a key document on the late Roman army, lists a large number of regular units with barbarian names.|$|E

5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>that</b> he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E

O'Toole followed up with an editorial in <b>The</b> <b>Record</b> <b>that</b> elaborated on these talking points and attacks. It raised further questions on whether O'Toole should continue to serve on the committee.|$|E
