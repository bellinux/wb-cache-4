5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a <b>tensile</b> <b>elasticity</b> modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|E

However, the materiality is often taught in terms of physical properties (e. g. <b>tensile,</b> <b>elasticity,</b> etc.).

The consideration of materialness can thus serve as a useful means for textile artists and other craft artists in creating meaningful artworks with any chosen materials...|$|E

A reliable parameter to predict myocardium stiffness and relaxation under similar end-diastolic pressure is being developed. We propose a material and mathematical model for calculating myocardium stiffness based {{on the concept of}} linear correlation between [Formula: see text] and wedge pressure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 919 patients (male: [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]). Compared with the younger population of controls (mean age: [Formula: see text] years; [Formula: see text]; male: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]), the elderly (mean age: [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]; male: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]) had a greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (all [Formula: see text]). We collected their M-mode and 2 -D echocardiographic volumetric parameters, intraventricular filling pressure, and speckle tracking images to establish a mathematical model. The feasibility of this model was validated. The average early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus assessed using tissue Doppler imaging was significantly attenuated in the elderly ([Formula: see text]: [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) and corresponded to the higher estimated wedge ([Formula: see text]) pressure ([Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) in that cohort. E (Young's modulus) was calculated to describe the <b>tensile</b> <b>elasticity</b> of the myocardium. With the same intraventricular filling pressure, E was significantly higher in the elderly, especially those with [Formula: see text] values [Formula: see text].

40|$|Terpsichore in Jimmy Choo {{sets up a}} {{relationship}} between high fashion bodies, material/fabric and theatre dance choreographies. It argues that these relationships have been crucial in twentieth and twenty-first century art dance and fashion practices. It examines the complex web of consumption, negotiation and re-appropriation between dance and fashion. It investigates the relationship between performance, shape, form, fabric, haute couture, modern dance and the bodies that set all of these into motion. The thesis includes a series of visual materials carefully tailored to deliver the overall argument of the thesis: a genealogy of high fashion bodies, material/fabric and theatre dance choreographies has always existed. To answer how contemporary dance, a “product” rich in cultural capital, feeds, affects, is transformed and appropriated by the socio-political economy of high fashion, I provide collections of visual materials in thematic groupings which include excerpts from fashion films, advertising campaigns and live catwalk or fashion performances. I use visual analysis, art history, and detailed movement analyses while paying particular attention to textile and costume construction, image composition, {{and the role of}} the camera. Whilst movement analysis informs my work in several chapters, other chapters draw upon other aspects of comparative dance analysis. I establish a kinetic language to read fashion performance through modern and post-modern dance choreography. This language can then be used to develop new trends in dance and fashion practice. I argue that fashion choreographies are influenced by shapes, forms, and the mobility of fashion materials. I utilise the concepts of dynamic flow, <b>tensile</b> <b>elasticity</b> and experimental shapes in space in order draw links between the modern dance choreographies of Loïe Fuller, Martha Graham, and Merce Cunningham and current fashion editorials. In later chapters, I engage with how punk aesthetics and attitude in British fashion was appropriated to subvert normative bodily representation in mainstream high fashion. I examine multiple collaborations between fashion designers and established dance companies in order to unpack the negotiations that occur when dealing with corporate art sponsorship. Terpsichore, the muse of dance, inspires these pages. I envision her dancing alongside the models, the photographers; I see her whispering inspirations to the choreographers and fashion designers. I would like to think she choreographs new ways of thinking about dance, fabric and the fashion industry. Her movement is either tensile or fluid, depending on what she wears.
