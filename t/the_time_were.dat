5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project.

Several reviews {{at the time}} compared Seinfeld to It's Garry Shandling's Show, in which Garry Shandling, like Seinfeld, plays a fictionalized version of himself.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held {{meant that he}} was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey {{in the absence of}} Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene.

At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers.

5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing {{almost as much}} as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E

5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age.

5|$|Described as battle-hungry, Augvald {{carried out}} raids into foreign territory, gaining great wealth and honour as a result. After {{a series of}} {{successful}} naval battles, {{he went on to}} conquer the land of the Holmrygr ("island-Rugi") people, based on the islands off the western coast of Rogaland. He banished the former chieftains from the newly conquered land, and set up his new base at the most favourable location on Karmøy, the largest island in Rogaland. The site he chose was later named Avaldsnes, after Augvald. Based on archaeological findings, it is believed that the ambitions of the increasingly powerful Norwegian chieftains of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> influenced by the Merovingian Franks, and especially Dagobert and his empire. As a builder of dynasties, Augvald has also been compared to Clovis.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
