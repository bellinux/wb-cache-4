5000|$|The NEC {{specifies}} acceptable {{numbers of}} conductors in crowded {{areas such as}} inside conduit, {{referred to as the}} fill rating. If the accepted fill rating is exceeded, then all the cables in the conduit are derated, lowering their acceptable maximum ambient operating <b>temperature.</b> <b>Derating</b> is necessary because multiple conductors carrying full-load power generate heat that may exceed the normal insulation temperature rating. (NEC 310.16) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{reliability}} of electric drives and driven motors {{depends on the}} quality of the power supply voltage especially in the critical industrial process. In this work, a theoretical study of the effects of voltage unbalances, sags and swells on induction motor (IM) is performed by using the conventional method based on the theory of symmetrical components. For this study, MATLAB software program is developed for calculating currents, torque, power losses, <b>temperature</b> rises and <b>derating</b> factor. Besides, experiments have been carried out for obtaining currents, torque and power losses. An agreement that is found between the theoretical predictions and experimental data allows us to take into consideration the predicted derating factor. Key-words: -Voltage unbalance, symmetrical components, sags, efficiency, power losses and derating factor. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{reliability}} of telecommunications equipment, its components, and the systems made using those components. Special {{attention is paid to}} creating stronger links between the reliability analyses performed at different hierarchy levels. The thesis starts with a <b>temperature</b> <b>derating</b> study. It is found out that the generic handbook based procedures may not always be very attractive, as they do not take satisfactorily into account the actual lifetime requirements. An alternative approach is proposed as a remedy to the current situation. Thermal cycling requirement handbooks are surveyed, and based on the findings some enhancements are proposed. Next, a component and product specific approach to create thermal cycling requirements is suggested. When applying the new approach several factors can be taken into account: the productâ€™s lifetime requirement, the field environment, the reliability test result, and the statistical distribution of the component population. A new method of how to predict {{the reliability of}} a component population that is addressed to several, different field environments is presented...|$|E
