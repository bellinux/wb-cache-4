5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté learned to read and write.|$|E

Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> {{criminal}} (Pflichtdelikte) was first proposed by Professor Roxin, but the crime nature of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> criminal {{is still being}} largely disputed in the criminal law theory circle, and someone {{thought it was the}} legal interest violation, and others thought it was the violation of positive obligation which has been recognized by the criminal law. As viewed from <b>the</b> <b>obligation,</b> <b>the</b> criminal law regulates two <b>obligations,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> positive <b>obligation</b> and <b>the</b> negative <b>obligation,</b> and <b>the</b> former is embodied in <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> of “not to harm others”, and the latter is embodied in <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> of “establish <b>the</b> common worlds with others”. <b>The</b> positive <b>obligation</b> not only contains “not to harm others”, but requires people to unify others, so <b>the</b> positive <b>obligation</b> can not equal to <b>the</b> negative <b>obligation.</b> As viewed from the criminal law, it is advisable to identify the behavior of violating negative <b>obligation</b> with <b>the</b> legal interest violation. But it is not correct to identify the behavior of violating positive <b>obligation</b> with <b>the</b> legal interest violation, because the crime nature of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> criminal is <b>the</b> violation of positive obligation which has been recognized by the criminal law. </p...|$|R

She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale.

5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing {{the present value of}} <b>the</b> <b>obligations.</b> This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E

5|$|The act {{authorised}} {{an initial}} £75,000 {{to be raised}} to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should be raised by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, {{and there was also}} disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.|$|E

5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate regarding extraterritorial human rights obligations with a specific focus on development cooperation. Various international human rights instruments enshrine <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to take steps through international assistance and cooperation towards the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights, yet the legal standing of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> remains contested, {{and a number of}} gaps remain as regards our understanding and application of <b>the</b> <b>obligation.</b> This study first considers the legal foundations of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> of international assistance and cooperation, reaffirming its existence as a legal duty, not just a moral one. With reference to the output of treaty bodies, reports of UN Special Procedures and relevant academic commentary, the various aspects <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> are clarified and placed within the context of international development cooperation. Specific extraterritorial duties in relation to the rights to education and health are also. identified. In order to provide contextual description of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> and means of its implementation, examination and comparison of development activities of American and British bilateral development agencies in Ghana is undertaken. Legislation, policies and activities of the United States and United Kingdom are explored to ascertain {{the degree to which they}} are consistent with elements of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> of international assistance and cooperation, and to assess the impact that their aid initiatives have on the exercise of the rights to education and health elsewhere. Although neither the US nor UK recognise the legal character of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> of international assistance and cooperation, there are some encouraging signs with regard to implementation of its various components. However, the analysis also makes apparent that as <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> continues to evolve there remain a number of significant challenges to its acceptance and wider implementation.

5|$|After Rajrajeshwori {{took over}} the regency, she was {{pressured}} by Knox to pay the annual pension of 82,000 rupees to the ex-King as per <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of the treaty, which paid off the vast debt that Rana Bahadur Shah had accumulated in Varanasi due to his spendthrift habits. The Nepalese court also felt it prudent to keep Rana Bahadur in isolation in Nepal itself, {{rather than in the}} British controlled India, and that paying off Rana Bahadur's debts could facilitate his return at an opportune moment. Rajrajeshowri's presence in Kathmandu also stirred unrest among the courtiers that aligned themselves around her and Subarnaprabha. Sensing an imminent hostility, Knox aligned himself with Subarnaprabha and attempted to interfere with the internal politics of Nepal. Getting a wind of this matter, Rajrajeshowri dissolved the government and elected new ministers, with Damodar Pande as the mul kaji, while the Resident Knox, finding himself persona non grata and the objectives of his mission frustrated, voluntarily left Kathmandu to reside in Makwanpur citing a cholera epidemic. Subarnaprabha and the members of her faction were arrested.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million.

In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county.

As regards the offences against the safety of civil aviation and hijacking, terrorism-related crimes, international drug trafficking, and crimes against UN personnel, the evidence is mixed and it is more appropriate to conclude that an emerging custom of <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> 'extradite-or-prosecute' for these crimes is forming...|$|R

5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E
5|$|He became pope in 1534 {{when he was}} 66 years old, and {{immediately}} appointed {{members of his family}} to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a break with the Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret <b>the</b> <b>obligations.</b> Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.|$|E

Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough (1707), a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence.
