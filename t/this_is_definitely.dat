To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been formed {{as a manifestation of}} Keenan's [...] "creative subconscious"—meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is [...] "a premiere improvisational hardcore band", and his [...] "catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc." [...] project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his [...] "attempt to make music to inspire people. ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good." [...] In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said {{that he did not want}} the lyrics to be puzzles.

500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} video a B+ and commented, [...] "This live CD-DVD can't {{replicate}} being there, Sticky & Sweet — taped in Buenos Aires in 2008 — does capture the show's rejuvenative streak, {{as on the}} electro-garage 'Hung Up'. Props, too, for a behind-the-scenes doc that actually goes behind the scenes." [...] The Independent gave the release two out of five stars. The reviewer Andy Gill commented, [...] "For all the multitude of crotches spread about the stage, this is as unenticing as pop gets, utterly lifeless despite the fervent activity." [...] Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy felt that [...] "Despite its absurd charm, this CD won't provoke the rediscovery of Hard Candy {{that it seems to}} nudge towards. That said, it's still an entertaining blast from start to finish. And with the DVD record of her outstandingly outlandish tour bundled in, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> worth the entry price for anyone who still has even half an interest in the Queen Mum of Pop." [...] Mark Beech from Bloomberg Television said that [...] "It’s intriguing how note-perfect Madonna is while running around and doing splits." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album three and a half out of five stars and wrote that it [...] "featured stirring remixes, like a fresh mash-up of [...] "Vogue" [...] with the brassy funk of Hard Candys [...] "4 Minutes"." ...|$|E
500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with {{a lot of things going}} on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{various aspects}} of Super Mario RPG have {{received}} mixed reviews, the game garnered praise {{for the quality of}} the graphics and for the humor in particular. Nintendo Powers review commented that the [...] "excellent" [...] 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards, including [...] "Best Graphics", in a player's choice contest, though Super Mario 64 won [...] "Best Graphics". Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics, stating that they are [...] "the best seen on the Super NES". Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), and highly praised the rendered enemies, cinematics, and spell animations. 1UP.com stated that the graphic element is [...] "strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time", and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are [...] "typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation". RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated that they [...] "perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D". Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are [...] "absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system". The editor also called the music [...] "quite extraordinary" [...] and that the songs [...] "match the mood of the surrounding environment". In the Virtual Console re-release, IGN's Lucas Thomas's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game's experience [...] "completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action". The publication also stated that the soundtrack is [...] "spectacular and a joy to listen to" [...] and the graphics [...] "took full advantage of the system's 16-bit technology and looks great".|$|E

2500|$|Many reviewers {{questioned}} the design choices {{in comparison to}} Duke Nukem 3D, with Kotaku stating that [...] "Old-school shooters, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> trying {{to be one of}} those with its basic AI and lack of cover mechanics, always had two great things going for them: speed and a ridiculous arsenal of weapons... Forever eschews this in favour of a plodding pace and two guns."

Yes, she is a cheerleader, but she also goes home and listens to punk music. She's into really dark art and probably rips the heads off of Barbie dolls. Basically, she's a train wreck."

Working with him [...] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip". After recording all the instrumental parts for the record, Moreno decided to record his vocals separately, and finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. According to an interview with Abe Cunningham, there were tensions involved with the recording of Saturday Night Wrist that were related to the band members' personal lives.

2500|$|Critics {{take the}} {{repetition}} of different forms of [...] "use" [...] to mean many different things. It is pointed out by one critic that [...] "the procreation sonnets display with particular brilliance Shakespeare's ability to manipulate words which in his language belonged both to the economic and the sexual/biological semantic fields". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> applicable to the word and manipulation of the word [...] "use". In terms of sexuality, it is commonly thought that the speaker is [...] "advising the young man on the proper 'use' of his semen". The same critic also interprets the sonnet as the man misusing his semen by masturbating. Seen throughout many of the Procreation Sonnets {{is the idea that}} [...] "the proper 'use' of semen involves not the creation of life as such but the creation of beauty". The sonnet may not only be referencing masturbation though, the [...] "language of usury in the procreation sonnets [...] has strong associations with both prostitution and sodomitical relations". There is, however, an economic aspect as well, changing the connotation of the quatrain. [...] "Usury may denote a specific economic practice," [...] but also at this time, [...] "it [...] all that seemed destabilizing and threatening in the socioeconomic developments affecting early modern England".|$|E
2500|$|Her third {{release was}} Mahesh Bhatt's romantic comedy Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke {{opposite}} Aamir Khan, which many critics called her career's best performance. Critics wrote [...] "Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla have already {{proved to be}} a great on-screen pair and here they shine once again. Aamir Khan is effective in a suitably restrained performance but it is Juhi Chawla who steals the show with her comic nirvana. Easily she is the funniest actor in the history of Hindi cinema {{and it would be a}} tough challenge for any actor to match up to that. Moreover, her effortless dialogue delivery in Tamil (especially for someone who doesn't speak the language) only further prove what a gifted actress she is." [...] Another critic wrote [...] "The film ultimately belongs to Juhi, because she is the soul of all things. She is the active reason of things happening. She is the fun. She is that innocence people love. It is difficult to imagine any other actress in this role. Such is her natural charm and comic sense in this one, and she truly deserved the Filmfare she received. Looking sweet and simple throughout the film she makes you smile with her mere presence. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> her best performance. Add to it she is acting opposite Aamir, the two compliment each other and share a crackling chemistry and you are left with a feeling of bliss". The pairing of Chawla with Khan (one of the most popular on screen pairings of the '90s) resulted in hype over the film's release, and it proved a major commercial and critical success. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the film.|$|E
6000|$|The {{obsolescent}} Atahocan {{seems to}} have had no moral activity. But, in America, this indolence of God is not universal. Mr. Parkman indeed writes: [...] "In the primitive Indian's conception of a God, the idea of moral good has no part".(1) But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> contradicted by Heriot, Strachey, Winslow, already cited, and by Pere Le Jeune. The good attributes of Kiehtan and Ahone were not borrowed from Christianity, were matter of Indian belief before the English arrived. Mr. Parkman writes: [...] "The moment the Indians began to contemplate the object of his faith, and sought to clothe it with attributes, it became finite, and commonly ridiculous". It did so, as usual, in MYTHOLOGY, but not in RELIGION. There is nothing ridiculous in what is known of Ahone and Kiehtan. If they had a mythology, and if we knew the myths, doubtless they would be ridiculous enough. The savage mind, turned from belief and awe into the spinning of yarns, instantly yields to humorous fancy. As we know, mediaeval popular Christianity, in imagery, marchen or tales, and art, copiously illustrates the same mental phenomenon. Saints, God, our Lord, and the Virgin, all play ludicrous and immoral parts in Christian folk-tales. This is Mythology, and here is, beyond all cavil, a late corruption of Religion. Here, where we know the history of a creed, Religion is early, and these myths are late. Other examples of American divine ideas might be given, such as the extraordinary hymns in which the Zunis address the Eternal, Ahonawilona. But as the Zuni religion has only been studied in recent years, the hymns would be dismissed as [...] "borrowed," [...] though there is nothing Catholic or Christian about them. We have preferred to select examples where borrowing from Christianity is out of the question. The current anthropological theory is thus confronted with American examples of ideas of the divine which cannot have been borrowed, while, if the gods are said to have been evolved out of ghosts, we reply that, in some cases, they receive no sacrifice, sacrifice being usually a note of ghostly descent. Again, similar gods, as we show, exist where ghosts of chiefs are not worshipped, and as far as evidence goes never were worshipped, because {{there is no evidence of}} the existence at any time of such chiefs. The American highest gods may then be equally free from the taint of ghostly descent.|$|E
