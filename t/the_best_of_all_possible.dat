5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E

Leibniz {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in Théodicée that this {{best of all}} possible worlds will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual. The existence {{of the universe is}} the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the Idea or Reason and are, therefore, logical. It is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E
25|$|With {{the acts}} of allegorizing mythological-pastoral world of drama, Dubravka expands {{the meaning of the}} plot on the {{contemporary}} political world of Dubrovnik and also expands with the convention certain limits of the pastoral and pastoral genre itself. At the same time, according to its ideal imaginary political vision of a prosperous city-state, Dubravka is a kind of utopia; its a hymn to the ideal social order and to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> countries ruled by divine principles of fairness, honesty, beauty and goodness. With the pastoral story line set in a timeless, mythical world of eternal love and freedom, in the allegorical tone, Gundulić sets his work in the specific time and place and gives it the moral, political and ethical meaning of his time, noting also its advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
500|$|Interestingly, this {{critique}} of Voltaire's {{seems to be}} directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. Candide does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary Alexander Pope, a later optimist of slightly different convictions. Candide does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that [...] "all is right", but Leibniz's that states, [...] "this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". However subtle {{the difference between the}} two, Candide is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's Poème may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to Candide in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the Poème embodies a more serious philosophical argument than Candide.|$|E

500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, {{convinced that if}} this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe {{as one of the most}} horrible disasters [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{historical}} events inspired Voltaire to write Candide, {{most notably the}} publication of Leibniz's [...] "Monadology", a short metaphysical treatise, the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. [...] Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in Candide and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day, had a strong influence on theologians {{of the day and}} on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, [...] "all is for the best in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds" [...] (Fr. Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist world view.|$|E
