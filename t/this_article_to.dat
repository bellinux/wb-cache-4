25|$|When a {{physician}} friend gave <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>to</b> Ovila Lesperance, a nephew to the Giant, {{it was the}} first indication the family had about the body’s whereabouts. In 1975 Lesperance found the Giant’s body during a visit to the University of Montreal. Until that time, a cover was draped only around the outside of the glass, allowing visitors to look at Édouard’s body inside. Disgusted by this display Lesperance succeeded in getting officials to partially wrap the cloth around the body of the giant inside the case. University officials agreed to do this but Lesperance and many of Édouard’s other relatives remained unsatisfied, including the Giant’s grandniece, Cecile Gibouleau.|$|E

60|$|Common {{sense is}} {{accustomed}} to {{the division of the}} world into mind and matter. It is supposed by all who have never studied philosophy that the distinction between mind and matter is perfectly clear and easy, that the two do not at any point overlap, and that only a fool or a philosopher could be in doubt as to whether any given entity is mental or material. This simple faith survives in Descartes and in a somewhat modified form in Spinoza, but with Leibniz it begins to disappear, and from his day to our own almost every philosopher of note has criticised and rejected the dualism of common sense. It is my intention in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>to</b> defend this dualism; but before defending it we must spend a few moments on the reasons which have prompted its rejection.|$|E
