5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> {{and stirred}} {{me from a}} bleary-eyed reverie. I sat down, poured myself a glass of scotch and waited for <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to <b>ring.</b> It rang and rang. My bags were packed and I {{was out on the}} street. Three hours and three days later and it was the {{imaginary}} man in a snake dance. The recipe: the kid said he'd been standing on the same corner for a thousand nights. I haven't seen him for a while, guess nothing much came of it - hope he's alright. Once {{you get used to it}} - it's too bad.|$|R
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings,</b> it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{moment in}} [...] "Crisis", of Lionel {{preparing}} to kill himself, was also added {{at the last}} minute. John Glover and the crew filmed the scene during the filming of [...] "Memoria", which occurred a week before [...] "Crisis" [...] was going to air. While filming, Greg Beeman, James Marshall and Miles Millar were all sitting behind the monitors, {{trying to come up}} with the cliffhanger ending that was going to be attached to [...] "Crisis". Beeman added the moment where <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings,</b> interrupting Lionel from completing his suicide; this was used as the opening for [...] "Legacy" [...] and it all eventually set up Lionel’s terminal liver disease. Another late change, though it was not at the last minute, came for Lionel’s physical appearance on the show. John Glover came up with the idea of cutting Lionel’s hair for the season finale. Glover was busy preparing for a play that he was going to be acting in, and he needed his hair cut for the part. Glover made the suggestion while the crew was filming [...] "Memoria", as well as the idea of setting the scene in prison. Gough admits to needing some kind of device to cut back to while all of the other cliffhangers are occurring—Clark being taken away, the Kryptonian symbol burned into field on the Kent farm, and Lex being poisoned—and he felt that Glover’s suggestion would help them pull off the effect they wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings.</b> He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E

Ryan saw the creature again but none of his friends could see it. His mother Jenny asked why Ryan left the light on and her boyfriend Colin, who Ryan did not get along with, suggested he might be having panic attacks having experienced them himself at Ryan's age. This finally gave Ryan a reason to like him. One day Ryan felt unsafe at home alone with the impression of the scary beings around. He typed the number 23553110 into <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> Sat Spy thinking it might be a postcode but <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> came out with the sound of screaming people. One morning <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and when Ryan answered the words 'The time is nearly up.' came in a menacing whisper. Ryan became fearful that he was going to die but did not want to give up <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and played <b>the</b> same message about time nearly up when he was left home alone.|$|R
