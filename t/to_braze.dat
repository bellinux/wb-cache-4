50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used <b>to</b> <b>braze</b> materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum brazing is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due {{to the absence of}} flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|E
50|$|Furnace brazing is a {{semi-automatic}} process used {{widely in}} industrial brazing operations {{due to its}} adaptability to mass production and use of unskilled labor. There are many advantages of furnace brazing over other heating methods that make it ideal for mass production. One main advantage is {{the ease with which}} it can produce large numbers of small parts that are easily jigged or self-locating. The process also offers the benefits of a controlled heat cycle (allowing use of parts that might distort under localized heating) and no need for post braze cleaning. Common atmospheres used include: inert, reducing or vacuum atmospheres all of which protect the part from oxidation. Some other advantages include: low unit cost when used in mass production, close temperature control, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>braze</b> multiple joints at once. Furnaces are typically heated using either electric, gas or oil {{depending on the type of}} furnace and application. However, some of the disadvantages of this method include: high capital equipment cost, more difficult design considerations and high power consumption.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the study of a new {{aluminum}} brazing process, called Galluminium.

Indeed if the gallium coating is done mechanically, it descales the alumina layer and acts as a barrier against further reoxidation. Nevertheless, liquid gallium causes a severe aluminum embrittlement since it penetrates into the aluminum grain boundaries. We will show in this paper that this phenomenon has only a little impact on the mechanical resistance of the brazed joints since the amount of deposited gallium is enough low to avoid a severe embrittlement and the heat treatment (from 200 degrees C to 600 degrees C during several minutes) during brazing process dissolves gallium in the bulk...|$|E

The CBN grains were well wetted by the filler alloy and formed a massive support profile. Moreover, the active element Ti of the filler diffused markedly and gathered in the interfacial of matrix/filler and filler/grain respectively. Due to the short dwell time in brazing, the newly formed resultants grew in a short time.
