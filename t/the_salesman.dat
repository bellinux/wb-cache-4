5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. <b>The</b> <b>salesman</b> may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|Stage Struck is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on a country girl who joins a traveling production after the company performs in her home town. She runs away from her home to join them and is hired, but the hard life soon takes it toll and she is unable to continue on with them. A traveling sales man buys her a ticket home and she goes home to her father. Several weeks later she receives a letter offering her a position in a New York theater production and a letter requesting her marriage from <b>the</b> <b>salesman.</b> She decides to accept his offer and become his wife. The film was released on March 3, 1911 and was met with good reviews, but the film's intended daydream sequence was not understood by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.|$|E

Picard finally tells <b>the</b> <b>salesman</b> he will buy the system, causing <b>the</b> <b>salesman</b> to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down.

While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his horse Epona, Link is ambushed by the masked Skull Kid and his fairy accomplices Tatl and Tael, who steal both Epona and his musical instrument, the Ocarina of Time. Link follows them down a dark cave, where he confronts the Skull Kid, who curses him by turning him into a Deku Scrub. Tatl stops Link from going after the Skull Kid as the latter escapes with Tael through a door, but is then separated from them when the door closes behind them. Realizing she needs Link's help to find them, Tatl insists that they work together. Link follows the Skull Kid through the cave into the inside of the Clock Tower in the land of Termina.

500|$|R singles were early purchases, {{starting}} a large collection he kept {{for the rest}} of his life. He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion. Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began when he read a LOOK magazine article about the Sam Goody record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One. The article described Varèse's percussion composition Ionisation, produced by EMS Recordings, as [...] "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the [...] "mad scientist" [...] looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded <b>the</b> <b>salesman</b> to sell him the record at a discount. Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers.|$|E

Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar. On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya. When law-enforcement officers appear {{at the back of the}} venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers [...] "FIRE!", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (yet somehow finding time to change into tuxedoes first). The video ends with Paul, Linda, and Michael as they drive off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the applications of the maximum-entropy principle as a heuristic for <b>the</b> multiple travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. This is a computationally complex problem which requires special treatment by conventional optimization techniques. Specific focus is given to developing a generalized framework for this problem that can be applied to any number of variants on the basic formulation. Additional consideration is given to the applications of this generalized framework to other variants on <b>the</b> travelling <b>salesman</b> problems such as the close enough travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. <b>The</b> heuristic framework developed here is shown to provide flexibility in addressing <b>the</b> multiple <b>salesman</b> variation on <b>the</b> travelling <b>salesman</b> problem as well as a several other variants on <b>the</b> travelling <b>salesman</b> problem. Additionally, this framework is shown to be effective in determining solutions to this class of problems, and it is especially effective for <b>the</b> close-enough travelling <b>salesman</b> problems which is particularly challenging for most conventional combinatorial algorithms. Concrete steps are presented by which to further extend and improve this framework to become both more widely applicable to variants on <b>the</b> travelling <b>salesman</b> problem, and more computationally efficient in solving such problems...|$|R

Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets <b>the</b> <b>salesman</b> job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim.
