50|$|The first <b>travel</b> <b>shot</b> {{was taken}} on the old West Side Elevated Highway, heading {{downtown}} (south), which is the opposite direction from Tuckahoe. If a driver on the highway was headed uptown, to the driver's left would be abandoned piers on the Hudson River and New Jersey. Like the shot on the Miller Highway, another in the title sequence takes the viewer over the George Washington Bridge. In reality, this bridge connects New York City with New Jersey to the west, whereas Westchester County, where Maude lives, lies {{to the north of}} Manhattan. The most obvious and direct route from Manhattan to Tuckahoe would be to drive through The Bronx.|$|E
40|$|This article maps out the {{cinematic}} usage of ‘travelling shots’, or shots created through affixing a camera to a vehicle. This article initially examines the earliest {{examples of such}} shots, the nineteenth century train-mounted ‘Phantom Rides’ that synthesized two iconic technologies of modernity, rail and film, to create a form of camera movement that demonstrated the new technologies’ mastery of space. This article asks {{what happened to this}} trope of movement as prowess. To this end, using the conceptual frameworks provided by film historian Tom Gunning’s concept of a ‘cinema of attractions’ and fellow film historian Charles Musser’s concept of a ‘cinema of contemplation’, narrative films are analysed in relation to how the <b>travelling</b> <b>shot</b> was co-opted for thematic means. Salient <b>travelling</b> <b>shots,</b> sourced from the nineteenth century Phantom Rides to 2009 s Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince are used to trace the lineage of the <b>travelling</b> <b>shot</b> up into our present time. By examining how film-makers have adapted <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> for integration within narrative films, and accommodated such new cinematic and transport technologies as CGI and helicopters, a foundation for understanding the rhetorical impulses of <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> is developed...|$|R

50|$|When {{the film}} first came out, {{it began with}} a five-minute {{sequence}} outlining the relationships of the main characters, before the spectacular <b>travelling</b> <b>shot</b> that descends from the rooftops.

"Singh’s directorial {{choices are}} often remarkably effective, {{whether in the}} camera angles, the long <b>travelling</b> <b>shots,</b> the nervous tension and {{insecurity}} transmitted in every glance and reflected in every silence and echoed in every sound," [...] wrote Dan Fainaru for Screen Daily while commenting on {{the pace of the}} movie as [...] "self-indulgent". [...] "Prolonged sequences and themes repetitively overstated - risk alienating viewers to the point where 30 minutes less would be so much more," [...] he wrote in his review.|$|R
2500|$|A {{different}} kind of collective memory was considered in Toute la mémoire du monde (1956), in which the seemingly endless spaces and bibliographic riches of the Bibliothèque nationale were explored in another compendium of long <b>travelling</b> <b>shots.</b> [...] In 1958 Resnais undertook a commission from the Pechiney company to make short film, in colour and wide-screen, extolling the merits of plastics, Le Chant du styrène.

50|$|Despite {{the close}} {{correspondence}} between the written and filmed works, numerous differences between them have been identified. Two notable examples are the choice of music in the film (Francis Seyrig's score introduces extensive use of a solo organ), and a scene {{near the end of}} the film in which the screenplay explicitly describes a rape, whereas the film substitutes a series of repeated bleached-out <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> moving towards the woman. In subsequent statements by the two authors of the film, it was partly acknowledged that they did not entirely share the same vision of it.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the advice}} of Silberman, Buñuel used video {{playback}} monitors on the set {{for the first time}} in his career, resulting in a vastly different style than any of his previous films, including zooms and <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> instead of his usual close-ups and static camera framing. It also resulted in Buñuel's being more comfortable on set, and in limiting his already minimal direction to technical and physical instructions. This frustrated Cassel, who had never worked with Buñuel before, until Rey explained that this was Buñuel's usual style and that since they were playing aristocrats their movements and physical appearance were more important than their inner motivation.|$|R

50|$|Resnais {{wanted to}} film {{in a studio}} in order to {{preserve}} a theatrical style of décor which matched Ayckbourn's dialogue, but budget constraints made it impossible to build full sets of the houses of the various couples. He therefore took inspiration from his teenage memory of a stage production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull for which Georges Pitoëff had used pieces of fabric to give minimal indication of settings. The designer Jacques Saulnier devised a series of painted curtains and simple props to provide a schematic representation of gardens, trees, or facades of houses. The sense of theatricality was reinforced by introducing the scenes with sketches of the setting by the cartoonist and graphic artist Blutch, alongside <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> filmed in the roads and lanes of Yorkshire.|$|R

40|$|Fleuve Congo à Kinshasa’ is {{the first}} part of the series ’Un jour l’avenir nous donnera raison’. M. F. Plissart made this film in {{collaboration}} with the anthropologist Filip De Boeck (K UL). Forming the border between Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Congo-Brazzaville, the Congo river is known as a no-go zone. The camera focusses on three protagonists. The first is Michel, a young Kinois boxer. He practises daily in a little area near his school. The other two are the river itself, and the city. In a sequence of single images captured in <b>travelling</b> <b>shots</b> while navigating the Congo, we see Kinshasa – the industry, the markets, the previous colonial buildings, the abandoned places, the neighbouring land, the survival strategies, and so on. In 2004, an early version of the film was shown as part of the Golden Lion-winning exhibition ’Kinshasa, the Imaginary City’, in the Belgian Pavilion at the 9 th International Architecture Biennale of Venice and conceived of by Koen Van Synghel, Filip De Boeck and Marie-Françoise Plissart.

50|$|Hopkirk's {{appearances}} {{were achieved}} by the simplest and cheapest of means, which had been in use since {{the earliest days of}} cinema. While the camera remained static, the other actors would freeze, Kenneth Cope would enter the scene and the other actors would unfreeze. Cutting out the extraneous footage in between was all that was necessary. Disappearances used the same method in reverse. Optical effects, which were prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at the time, were largely avoided, although superimposition or bluescreen <b>travelling</b> matte <b>shots</b> were very occasionally used. In at least one scene, the Victorian theatrical illusion Pepper's Ghost was used.|$|R

The investigators counted 113 bullet holes in the vehicle. As a result of the attack, Salatyn Asgarova died instantly. Three military officers (Lieutenant-Colonel O. Larionov, Major I. Ivanov and Sergeant I. Goyek) of the Soviet Army accompanying her were killed as well. The attackers - Arno Mkrtchian, Hrachik Petrossian, A.

5000|$|Despite {{all these}} difficulties, the film O noapte furtunoasă (A Stormy Night) was {{completed}} between 1941 and 1942 in the ONC [...] "studio". Producing the film under wartime conditions was a labor fit for Sisyphus, equally for the actors, cameraman, stage electricians, script-girl, stage designers and prop handlers. All the exteriors {{had to be}} constructed in the small 18×11 m studio, intended for music recording, since exterior shooting at night was impossible due {{to the need to}} maintain camouflage. For panoramic or <b>travelling</b> <b>shots,</b> two or three scenes had to be shot on a stage that had to be decorated two or three times over, and then combined in order to constitute a whole shot. The way this worked in practice was that once a scene was filmed, the set was taken down and the next design thrown up. Only one thing was not lacking for them: photographic material. In the end, 29,000 m were shot. The film O noapte furtunoasă was directed by Jean Georgescu, based on the eponymous comedy by Ion Luca Caragiale; the assistant directors were Ionel Iliescu, Virgil Stoenescu, I. Marinescu, and P. Băleanu; the cameraman was Gerard Perrin (from Paris); the sound engineers were A. Bielisici, V. Cantunari, and G. Mărăi; editing was done by Ivonne Hérault (from Paris) and Lucia Anton; makeup by the Sturh couple (of Berlin); choreography by Emil Bobescu; music by Paul Constantinescu; set design by Ștefan Norris; storyboards and costumes by Aurel Jiquidi; and production direction by Ion Cantacuzino. The film starred Alexandru Giugaru, Maria Maximilian, Florica Demion, Radu Beligan, Iordănescu Bruno, George Demetru, Ion Baroi, George Ciprian, Miluță Ghiorghiu, Leontina Ioanid, Doina Missir, Iuliana Sym, Cornelia Teodosiu, Elena Bulandra, Vasiliu Falti, Lică Rădulescu, Ion Stănescu, Nicolae Teodoru, O. Rocos, Iancu Constantinescu and Jean Moscopol. It premiered on 22 March 1943 at the ARO theatre. This was the first and last film produced by the ONC; for many years it remained a point of reference in the annals of cinematic art in Romania.|$|R
50|$|Viktor Pavičić {{was born}} on 15 October 1898. A colonel, he was the {{commander}} of the Croatian Home Guard military academy from July to August 1942. In August, he was named commander of the 369th Reinforced Croatian Infantry Regiment that was to fight alongside other Axis forces on the Eastern Front. In late September, Croatian leader Ante Pavelić met with Pavičić and decorated him. Immediately afterwards, Pavičić and his regiment left the Independent State of Croatia to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad. They were devastated in the ensuing battle, and Pavičić elected to leave the surviving Croatian soldiers and return to Croatia. He was killed on 20 January 1943. There are several conflicting accounts of how he died. One account holds that the airplane in which he was <b>travelling</b> was <b>shot</b> down by the Soviets, while another states that he was executed by the Germans for wishing to leave the battlefield. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Marko Mesić on 21 January.|$|R
5000|$|Lady Anne died in 1917, {{passing on}} her titles to the Blunt's only child, their daughter, Judith, who {{became known as}} [...] "Lady Wentworth." [...] The Crabbet estate went to Lady Anne's granddaughters, as did what horses she still owned in England. Lady Wentworth had already {{purchased}} back some animals that Wilfred had sold to third parties and thus had a small herd of her own. Wilfrid then attempted to seize the horses and land, making a nighttime raid on Crabbet and initially taking all of the horses, including those already legally owned by Lady Wentworth. The mare Bukra, too near foaling to <b>travel,</b> was <b>shot</b> on Wilfred's orders. Bitter and anxious to pay off his creditors, Wilfrid sold 37 horses, exporting several to W.R. Brown's Maynesboro stud in the United States. Between thefts and sales of horses at Newbuildings, many horses of the original Blunt breeding program were lost to Crabbet. In turn, Lady Wentworth and her children forcibly took her favorite mare, Riyala, from Wilfrid's stable, and purchased back many horses from their new owners.|$|R
