40|$|New {{provisioning}} rules {{introduced by}} IFRS 9 {{are expected to}} reduce the procyclicality of provisioning. Heterogeneity among banks in the procyclicality of provisioning may not only reflect the formal accounting rules, but also variation in discretionary provisioning policies. This paper presents empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of provisioning procyclicality among significant banks that are directly supervised by the ECB. In particular, this paper finds that provisioning is relatively procyclical at banks that have i) high loans-to-assets ratios, ii) high shares of non-interest income in <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> iii) low capitalization rates, and iv) low total assets. Supervisory guidance provided to banks on how to implement IFRS 9 has mostly been of a qualitative nature, and may prove inadequate to prevent an undesirably wide future variation in provisioning among EU banks.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} out {{of three}} essays on systemic risk, systemic importance, and bank profitability. The first essay (Döring et al., 2016, Systemic risk measures and their viability for banking supervision) {{contributes to the literature}} by proposing a criteria-based framework to assess the viability of systemic risk measures as a monitoring tool for banking supervision and investigates the bank characteristics that determine the banking system's overall level of systemic risk. We assess the monitoring qualities of the former systemic risk measures by focusing on their forecasting capabilities for a set of major aggregated bank-specific and macroeconomic state variables. The second essay (Döring et al., 2016 a, Systemic importance, default risk, and profitability in the European banking system) examines the relation between banks' systemic importance and their default risk and return characteristics on a broad sample of listed European banks. To be more specific, we analyze whether systemically important banks exhibit default risk and return patterns that are distinctively different from those of non-systemically important banks. The third essay (Döring, 2016, Risk-adjusted bank performance and income diversification) contributes to the academic literature by analyzing the effects of income diversification on banks' profitability patterns for a broad sample of listed and unlisted euro area banks covering the period from 2007 to 2014. We measure bank profitability employing the ratio return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA) and proxy a bank's income diversification by calculating the shares of non-interest income, fee income, trading income, and other non-interest income in <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} both {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of bank fee and commission income in the European Union with a special emphasis on the Czech Republic. Since fee income represents the largest part of non-interest income earned by banks, it remains a major challenge for bank management to set and maintain an appropriate fee policy. However, solving for the optimal fee structure {{has not yet been}} accomplished either on a theoretical level, or in actual practice. In the empirical part of the paper, we analyse banking fee income in EU banking sectors based on three different indicators: the magnitude of net fee and commission income relative to <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> to total assets and to gross domestic product. Our results show that the Czech banking sector was not abnormally dependent on fee income compared to other EU countries in the period 2007 - 2012. As a result, we argue that the high profitability of Czech banks cannot be attributed to abnormal banking fees and commission income, but rather that other factors should be considered. We also concluded that the market concentration of the Czech banking sector declined since the Herfindahl index decreased in last years. The rise in competition was caused mainly by new entrants we refer to as ‘low-cost banks’ that offer a limited product portfolio and provide a large part of their services without fees and commissions. Consequently, we have determined that the business models of some low cost banks in the Czech Republic are not sustainable from a longer term perspective...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the productivity of Turkish Banks according to the effect of scale in the Post-Crises Period. The data used in this study covers the period from 2002 : 1 to 2004 : 3. We applied Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric linear programming-based technique for measuring relative performance of decision-making units (DMUs). We calculated DEA as constant & variable return-to-scale based on output oriented Malmquist Index. Although the scale effect can be measured with DEA scale efficiency measurement, we used scale indicators as input variables in order to find out not only scale efficiency but also scale affect directly. We applied DEA by using financial ratios (Athanassopoulos and Ballantine, 1995; Yeh, 1996) and branch & personel number indicators. This study uses five input variables as i) branch numbers, ii) personnel number per branch, iii) share in total assets, iv) share in total loans, v) share in total deposits; and five output variables as i) net profit-losses/total assets (ROA), ii) net profit-losses/total shareholders equity (ROE), iii) net interest income/total assets, iv) net interest income/ <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> and v) noninterest income/total assets. We find that difference in efficiency is mainly from technical efficiency rather than scale efficiency in the post-crises period. The other finding reveals that efficiency approximate between selected banks and supporting that advantage of scale economies can be lost in Turkish banking. Overall, the results confirm that Turkish banking has U shaped Scale Efficiency on selected profitability ratios. The application of this paper based on other financial ratios with decreasing and increasing return-to-scale DEA is left to future research. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} Schure and Wagenvoort (1999) study, which {{considers}} {{economies of scale}} and efficiency in European banking, {{in a number of}} directions. Firstly, we introduce what we believe to be important improvements to estimating efficiency. Secondly, we examine more closely the characteristics of the banks on the cost frontier and draw comparisons between the characteristics of these banks and those of the relatively inefficient banks in our sample. In contrast with the results of Schure and Wagenvoort (1999), we find that both X-efficient savings banks and Xefficient commercial banks have cut their average cost, independent of input price movements or changes in the output mix, by about 5 percent each year during the five-year period following the implementation of the Second Banking Directive of the European Union on the first of January 1993. In other words, we observe structural shifts in the cost frontier, possibly due to technological progress. X-inefficient banks became only slightly more inefficient than their efficient counterparts. Therefore, these banks also experienced substantial reductions in average cost. However, these reductions are mainly explained by lower interest expenditures because of lower real interest rates rather than structural changes. Additionally to the results of Schure and Wagenvoort (1999), an examination of the output mix of efficient and inefficient banks reveals that the efficient banks {{are likely to be more}} involved in more "commercial" (or fee-based) activities since their ratio of commission revenue to <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> is higher. The profitability of savings banks appears strongly determined by their cost efficiency which supports the efficient structure hypothesis. The average profitability of efficient commercial banks seems mainly driven by other factors, such as possibly output prices, rather than cost considerations.
