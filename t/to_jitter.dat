30|$|<b>Jitter</b> due <b>to</b> noise can be {{classified}} into random jitter and deterministic jitter. Random <b>jitter,</b> also referred <b>to</b> as non-systematic <b>jitter,</b> is an unpredictable jitter component whose amplitude is unbounded and Gaussian in nature. On the other hand, deterministic jitter, also known as systematic jitter, is a predictable jitter component whose amplitude is bounded. Physical noise sources are considered as the major contributor <b>to</b> random <b>jitter</b> in CMOS delay lines. Circuit design-induced noise sources also contribute to random jitter; however, they contribute more <b>to</b> deterministic <b>jitter</b> through DCD, EMI, charge-sharing and coupling noise. Device mismatch caused by intra-die process variations also contributes <b>to</b> deterministic <b>jitter</b> (Jia 2005; Li 2008).|$|R

50|$|Because the {{algorithm}} operates on single pixels {{and has no}} conditional statements, it is very fast and suitable for real-time transformations. Additionally, because {{the location of the}} dithering patterns stays always the same relative to the display frame, it is less prone <b>to</b> <b>jitter</b> than error-diffusion methods, making it suitable for animations. Because the patterns are more repetitive than error-diffusion method, an image with ordered dithering compresses better. Ordered dithering is more suitable for line-art graphics as it will result in straighter lines and fewer anomalies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>jitter</b> due <b>to</b> random and deterministic disturbances in nonautonomous current-mode logic circuits. First, we present an analytical model that explains the transformation of noise into jitter as a linear timevariant process, with its time-domain impulse response function and a frequency-domain system function. The model is then used <b>to</b> analyze <b>jitter</b> in two different circuits, with different sources of noise. In the first example, we use the model <b>to</b> predict <b>jitter</b> due <b>to</b> device noise in a frequency divider, and identify devices that are the main contributors <b>to</b> the <b>jitter.</b> In the second example, we examine jitter of a buffer with deterministic ground noise. Jitter predictions are compared to the results obtained through exhaustive simulation. According to the comparison, the method predicts jitter with an error of up to 3. 4 %.

The azimuth of the aircraft is determined from the direction the antenna is pointing when the first reply was received, until the last reply is received.

30|$|As the MT {{spectrogram}} is robust <b>to</b> <b>jitters</b> in the amplitudes {{and locations}} of a signal’s components [17], selecting {{the first two}} singular vectors of the MT spectrogram is more intuitive than the AS-based representation. However, as shown in [17], using singular vectors of the spectrogram for classification of multi-component signals requires several singular vector pairs and more advanced algorithms to combine the singular vectors in an appropriate way. To ensure better comparability of ambiguity- and TF-domain analysis, we, however, base our investigations in both cases on only the first pair of singular vectors.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{currently}} the highest quality method of converting 60i footage to 24p. It involves using optical flow to extrapolate 24 frames of information from 60 frames while compensating for the time displacement between the two. For example, in one second of 60i footage, each image is captured at 1/60 second, which does not perfectly align with images {{that would have been}} captured 24 times per second. Simply [...] "cherry picking" [...] 24 images out of 60 does not present 24 frames with perfect temporal consistency, since more or less time may have elapsed between frames.
