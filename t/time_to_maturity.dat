2500|$|Zero coupon bonds have a {{duration}} {{equal to}} the bond's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity,</b> which makes them sensitive to any changes in the interest rates.

2500|$|The above {{measures}} {{are independent of}} time, but for a given simple moneyness, options near expiry and far for expiry behave differently, as options far from expiry have more time for the underlying to change. Accordingly, one may incorporate <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> τ into moneyness. Since dispersion of Brownian motion {{is proportional to the}} square root of time, one may divide the log simple moneyness by this factor, yielding: [...] This effectively normalizes for time to expiry – with this measure of moneyness, volatility smiles are largely independent of time to expiry.|$|E

In this study, we apply their model on Financial Time Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 index option. As a benchmark, we employ the ad hoc BS model which uses a separate implied volatility for each option to fit the smirk/smile in implied volatilities. The test finds that the HN GARCH has smaller valuation errors than the ad hoc BS model. ...|$|R

2500|$|In finance, {{the yield}} curve is a curve showing several yields or {{interest}} rates across different contract lengths (2 month, 2 year, 20 year, etc....) {{for a similar}} debt contract.

As the market for long term interest rates is less liquid, financial institutions and the regulator must rely, to some extent, on subjective parameters in regulation. An Ultimate Forward Rate {{is one way of}} dealing with the dependence on long term interest rates. We discuss two views with respect to the role of subjective parameters in regulation. These different views relate to the interpretation of a pension contract: a social contract or a financial contract.

40|$|The discrete-time multifactor Vasicek {{model is}} a {{tractable}} Gaussian spot rate model. Typically, two- or three-factor versions allow one to capture the dependence structure between yields with different <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> in an appropriate way. In practice, re-calibration of the model to the prevailing market conditions leads to model parameters that change over time. Therefore, the model parameters should be understood as being time-dependent or even stochastic. Following the consistent re-calibration (CRC) approach, we construct models as concatenations of yield curve increments of Hull-White extended multifactor Vasicek models with different parameters. The CRC approach provides attractive tractable models that preserve the no-arbitrage premise. As a numerical example, we fit Swiss interest rates using CRC multifactor Vasicek models...|$|R

Restrictions on the prices of Hermite polynomial risk for contingent claims with different <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> are derived. These restrictions are rejected by our empirical tests of a four-parameter model. The unrestricted results indicate skewness and excess kurtosis in the implied risk-neutral density.
