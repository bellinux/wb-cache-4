40|$|ABSTRACT−Narrow {{commuter}} vehicles {{can address}} many congestion, parking and pollution {{issues associated with}} urban transportation. In making narrow vehicles safe, comfortable and acceptable to the public, active tilt control systems are likely to play a crucial role. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} an active direct tilt control system for a narrow vehicle that utilizes an actuator in the vehicle suspension. A simple PD controller can stabilize the tilt dynamics of the vehicle to any desired tilt angle. However, the challenges in the tilt control system design arise in determining the desired lean angle in real-time and in minimizing tilt actuator torque requirements. Minimizing torque requirements requires the tilting and <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> to be synchronized as closely as possible. This paper explores two different control design approaches to meet these challenges. A Receding Horizon Controller (RHC) is first developed so as to systematically incorporate preview on road curvature and synchronize tilting with driver initiated turning. Second, a nonlinear control system that utilizes feedback linearization is developed and found to be effective in reducing torque. A close analysis of the complex feedback linearization controller provides insight into which terms are important for reducing actuator effort. This is used to reduce controller complexity and obtain a simple nonlinear controller that provides good performance...|$|E

Active camber mechanisms are also not a new concept, but they have not been implemented in a narrow packaging space with relatively large camber angle. Parallel mechanism research and vehicle dynamics theory were combined to generate and analyse this new corner module design. The corner module increases <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban electric <b>vehicle</b> by cambering <b>the</b> front wheels to - 15 degrees when <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> is turning. <b>The</b> camber angle augmentation increases the track width which subsequently decreases <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity height.

Addressing these issues is of significant importance in achieving persistent autonomy for outdoor UGVs, especially when navigating on unprepared terrains. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> is driven in the skid-steering mode, which is popular for many off-road land vehicle platforms. In this {{research work}}, a comprehensive approach is proposed for modeling <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> UGV. <b>The</b> approach considers the difference in speed between two outputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differential and <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> It describes dynamics of all components in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> driveline in an integrated manner with <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> motion. Given a pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throttle position, left and right braking efforts as the inputs, <b>the</b> dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels and other components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UGV can be predicted. For controlling <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> at <b>the</b> low level, PID controllers are firstly used for all actuators. As many components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> exhibit nonlinearities and time delay, the large overshoots encountered in the outputs can lead to undesirable vehicle behaviors. To alleviate the problem, a novel control approach is proposed for suppression of overshoots resulting from PID control. As a result, the proposed approach can improve significantly system robustness and reduce substantially step response overshoot.

Satellites can be placed into LEO from the payload bay or can be launched beyond LEO using upper stages. <b>The</b> next element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> STS will be the LEO space station,which will increase <b>the</b> allowed duration <b>of</b> scientific-andcommercial activities in orbit. Just as the shuttle introduced <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> reusable space <b>vehicles,</b> <b>the</b> space station will establish permanent human presence as an element of space operations. By <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century,reusable orbit-to-orbit <b>vehicles</b> {{will be added to}} the space station. <b>The</b> Orbital Transfer <b>Vehicles</b> (mwill be designed to lower <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> shipment of payloads to deep space through reuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper stage. The space station then will incorporate <b>the</b> hnction <b>of</b> a freight dock, where cargo is readied for transshipment to destinations beyond. At the same time, the shuttle will be nearing <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> its operational life; and a second generation of Earth-to-orbit transportation will be readied. Will this second generation consist of an updated shuttle, or will <b>the</b> fhnctions <b>of</b> transporting freight and carrying passengers be explicitly separated to alleviate <b>the</b> crippling expense <b>of</b> launching to LEO? For example, an unmanned launch vehicle based on shuttle propulsion technology could carry many times more cargo for less launch cost than does the shuttle today. However,the cost of developing such a vehicle can be justified only if the projected traffic into LEO is large. <b>The</b> buildup <b>of</b> a lunar base places demands on the STS that must be reflected in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements. The first three papers describe <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> a lunar base and other deep space activities.
