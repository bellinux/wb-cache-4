5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought {{to live in a}} bottomless well near the summit of Macphee’s Hill, and faery sidhes and their associated music were taken for granted, if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> themselves were dying.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E

60|$|Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty-seven {{years of}} age, short and thin, {{wrinkled}} in the face, and very unhealthy. But {{she had a}} great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies of her Court were magnificently dressed. She had a great liking too for old customs, without much sense in them; and she was oiled in <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> and blessed in <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> and done all manner of things to in <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>way,</b> at her coronation.

5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways.</b> The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theme of}} the series is that First World {{countries}} are likely to survive the Change better than Third World countries.

25|$|Some of {{the major}} themes {{explored}} in Wendy Rose’s works are themes relating to the Native American experience (both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization): colonialism, imperialism, dependency, nostalgia for <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> reverence for grandparents, resentment for conditions of the present, plight of reservation and urban Indians, sense of hopelessness, {{the power of the}} trickster, feminism as synonymous with heritage, deadly compromise, symbolism of all that has been lost (such as land), tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change, arrogance of white people, problems of half-breeds (or mixed-bloods).|$|E
25|$|During this ceremony, {{the king}} {{also had to}} participate, {{although}} he was a Christian, {{and he had to}} drink of the mead that was offered and consecrated for Odin, Njord and Freyja. The peasants also wanted him to eat of the meat, but he only gaped over the handle of the cauldron and held a linen cloth between his mouth and the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ipsita Roy Chakraverti (born Ipsita Chakraverti; 3 November 1950) is a Wiccan priestess {{based in}} India. Born into an elite family in India with a diplomat {{for a father}} and royalty for mother, Chakraverti spent her early years in Canada and the US where her father was stationed. There, she was allowed to join {{a select group of}} women {{studying}} ancient cultures of the world and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways.</b> Chakraverti studied with them for three years and finally chose Wicca as her religion. After coming back to India and getting married, Chakraverti declared herself as a witch in 1986. Amidst the backlash that followed her declaration, Chakraverti explained to the media the Neo Pagan ways of Wicca and its healing power.|$|E

25|$|Native Americans {{had become}} {{dependent}} on manufactured goods such as guns and domesticated animals, and lost much of their traditional practices. With the new cattle herds roaming the hunting lands, and {{a greater emphasis on}} farming due to the invention of the Cotton Gin, Native Americans struggled to maintain their place in the economy. An inequality gap had appeared in the tribes, as some hunters were more successful than others. Still, the creditors treated and individual’s debt as debt of the whole tribe, and used several strategies to keep the Native Americans in debt. Traders would rig the weighing system that determined the value of the deerskins in their favor, cut measurement tools to devalue the deerskin, and would tamper with the manufactured goods to decrease their worth, such as watering down the alcohol they traded. To satisfy the need for deerskins, many males of the tribes abandoned their traditional seasonal roles and became full-time traders. When the deerskin trade collapsed, Native Americans found themselves dependent on manufactured goods, and could not return to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> due to lost knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} deportation order. Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Wave {{appeared}} in January 1970, a stylistic departure offering poems {{that were more}} emotional, metaphoric, and lyrical. From the late 1960s, the content of Snyder's poetry increasingly {{had to do with}} family, friends, and community. He continued to publish poetry throughout the 1970s, much of it reflecting his re-immersion in life on the American continent and his involvement in the back-to-the-land movement in the Sierra foothills. His 1974 book Turtle Island, titled after a Native American name for the North American continent, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also influenced numerous West Coast Generation X writers, including Alex Steffen, Bruce Barcott and Mark Morford. His 1983 book Axe Handles, won an American Book Award. Snyder wrote numerous essays setting forth his views on poetry, culture, social experimentation, and the environment. Many of these were collected in Earth House Hold (1969), <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ways</b> (1977), The Real Work (1980), The Practice of the Wild (1990), A Place in Space (1995), and The Gary Snyder Reader (1999). In 1979, Snyder published He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth, based on his Reed thesis. Snyder's journals from his travel in India in the mid-1960s {{appeared in}} 1983 under the title Passage Through India. In these, his wide-ranging interests in cultures, natural history, religions, social critique, contemporary America, and hands-on aspects of rural life, as well as his ideas on literature, were given full-blown articulation.|$|E

25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of Sassanid rule in 224 an orthodox Pars-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century. After Ardashir I had deposed the last Parthian King, Artabanus V, he sought the aid of Tansar, a herbad (high priest) of the Iranian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of Iran to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the Letter of Tansar, which was addressed to Gushnasp, the vassal king of Tabarestan. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may have been good for the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways</b> had been good, and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The Letter of Tansar included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attempted to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.|$|E

500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ways,</b> celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E
