50|$|The {{fundamental}} communications {{mechanism in}} the Microwindows API is the message. A message {{consists of a}} well-known message number, and two parameters, known as wParam and lParam. Messages are stored in an application's message-queue, and retrieved via the GetMessage function. The application blocks while waiting for a message. There are messages that correspond to hardware events, like WM_CHAR for keyboard input or WM_LBUTTONDOWN for mouse button down. In addition, events signaling window creation and destruction WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are sent. In most cases, a message is <b>associated</b> with a <b>window,</b> identified as an HWND. After retrieving the message, the application sends the message <b>to</b> the <b>associated</b> <b>window's</b> handling procedure using DispatchMessage. When a window class is created, its associated message handling procedure is specified, so the system knows where to send the message.|$|R

For the randomly ordered list, no peaks are seen and no information can be gathered from these plots. For the ordering obtained using Dendogram algorithm, some peaks appear, but the ontology terms are not as concentrated as for the CFM algorithm. Figures S 7 -S 9 present different GO term profiles, for Random, CFM, and Dendogram orderings. Each panel refers to one GO term and presents the average value of the profile for the random ordering, as well as colored bands associated do deviations from these averages that range from 0 to 2 standard deviation (yellow bands) and from 2 to 4 standard deviations (pale pink bands). The gray region stands for deviations from the random average larger than 4 standard deviations. These standard deviations are calculated from the random ordering profile of each GO term.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{technical}} note herein presents an approach for estimating the suspended-sediment source from cutterhead, hopper, and clamshell dredges. The approach involves modifica-tion {{of an existing}} method developed from limited field data. These estimates are needed to provide input to a numerical model called SSFATE (Suspended Sediment FATE) that is being developed under the Dredging Operations and Environmental Research (DOER) Program. BACKGROUND: A need exists for numerical modeling tools to address questions related <b>to</b> environmental <b>windows</b> <b>associated</b> with dredging projects. One such question relates to where and in what quantity suspended sediment from dredging operations {{moves away from the}} dredging location. With this information, decision makers would be aided in determining reasonable start and end dates for environmental windows related to fish migratory pathways, sedimentation on sensitive benthic habitats, and other environmental issues. The SSFATE model is being developed under DOER to provide field offices with such a tool. The basic computations are based on a particle-tracking approach with each particle representing a certain amount of sediment mass that is generated at the location of the dredging operation. These particles are then diffused and transported throughout the water body of interest while undergoing settling. Suspended-sedimen...|$|R
40|$|Online First Published online : 08 December 2011 International audienceEnergy {{management}} in buildings is {{addressed in this}} paper. The energetic impact of buildings in the current energetic context is first depicted. Then the studied optimization problem {{is defined as the}} optimal management of production and consumption activities in houses. A scheduling problem is identified to adjust the energy consumption to both the energy cost and the inhabitant's comfort. The available flexibilities of the services provided by domestic appliances are used to compute optimal energy plans. These flexibilities are <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> time <b>windows</b> or heating storage abilities. A constraints formulation of the energy allocation problem is given. A derived mixed linear program is used to solve this problem. The energy consumption in houses is very dependent to uncertain data such as weather forecasts and inhabitants' activities. Parametric uncertainties are introduced in the home energy management problem in order to provide robust energy allocation. Robust linear programming is implemented. Event related uncertainties are also addressed through stochastic programming in order {{to take into account the}} inhabitant's activities. A scenario based approach is implemented to face this robust optimization problem...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} using overlapping sliding windows {{is among the}} most widely used techniques in analyzing non-stationary time series. Although sliding window analysis is convenient to implement, the resulting estimates are sensitive to the window length and overlap size. In addition, it undermines the dynamics of the time series as the estimate <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> each <b>window</b> uses only the data within. Finally, the overlap between consecutive windows hinders a precise statistical assessment. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by explicitly modeling the spectral dynamics through integrating the multitaper method with state-space models in a Bayesian estimation framework. The underlying states pertaining to the eigen-spectral quantities arising in multitaper analysis are estimated using instances of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and are used to construct spectrograms and their respective confidence intervals. We propose two spectral estimators that are robust to noise and are able to capture spectral dynamics at high spectrotemporal resolution. We provide theoretical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off, which establishes performance gains over the standard overlapping multitaper method. We apply our algorithms to synthetic data as well as real data from human EEG and electric network frequency recordings, the results of which validate our theoretical analysis...|$|R

For arbitrary oversampling, we furthermore consider tight Gabor frames canonically <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> <b>window</b> functions g satisfying certain decay properties. Here, we show under what conditions and to what extent the canonically associated tight frame inherits decay properties of g.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Hoek-Brown failure {{criterion}} for rock masses is widely accepted {{and has been}} applied in {{a large number of}} projects around the world. While, in general, it {{has been found to be}} satisfactory, there are some uncertainties and inaccuracies that have made the criterion inconvenient to apply and to incorporate into numerical models and limit equilibrium programs. In particular, the difficulty of finding an acceptable equivalent friction angle and cohesive strength for a given rock mass has been a problem since the publication of the criterion in 1980. This paper resolves all these issues and sets out a recommended sequence of calculations for applying the criterion.
