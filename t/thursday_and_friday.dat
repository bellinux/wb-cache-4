5|$|The Games {{took place}} on the <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Friday</b> of the week of Whitsun, {{normally}} between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century Puritans disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.|$|E

25|$|Very {{little of}} Johnson's early life is known with certainty. Two {{marriage}} licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, {{as do the}} entries showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi. That he was not listed among his mother's children in the 1910 census casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert's mother, remembered his birth date as May8, 1911. The 1920 census gives his age as 7, suggesting {{he was born in}} 1912 or 1913. Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, <b>Thursday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Friday,</b> November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas.

Woods struggled on Sunday and couldn't mount a big enough charge, shooting a level par 72 and settling for joint 3rd place. Woods' second tournament of the year came at the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in early February which he had not played since 2002. His amateur partner for the week was Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.
