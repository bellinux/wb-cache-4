5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E

5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> housework.|$|E
5|$|One day, Rachmat hears {{screaming}} and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her. Although Rachmat is disgusted {{that he has}} helped her after learning the identity of Atikah's father, as Rachmat and Atikah dedicate <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> social work, they begin to fall in love. Doerachman, however, disapproves of their relationship, and refuses to fund their work; as a result, Atikah takes her deceased mother's jewellery and some {{money to pay for}} village development. Later, when Rachmat and Atikah are sitting together and singing romantic songs, Mardjan overhears them. Hurrying back to Doerachman's home, Mardjan convinces his boss that Rachmat intends only to steal Doerachman's wealth, and to let Mardjan marry Atikah. As Doerachman prepares to leave, Mardjan has the illiterate hadji put his seal on a letter.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native riparian vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data on wildlife in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> JCWC activities.|$|E

5|$|The country's Second Science and Technology Policy was {{launched}} in June 2012, after being elaborated with UNESCO assistance. It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The Second Science and Technology Policy also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> studying science subjects.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted most of <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there {{until his death in}} 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E
5|$|Windle's {{performances}} qualified {{him for the}} 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, {{where he}} was slated to swim four events: the 400m and 1500m freestyle and the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle's first event was the 4×100m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's heat {{in a time of}} 3min 40.6s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at the halfway point to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6s in the final, but Australia could only improve <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> 3min 39.1s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1s. A distance swimmer, Windle could not keep up with his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9s behind the silver medalists {{by the end of the}} race.|$|E

Unlike the soldier who was trained to act as part of a team, the LSF member acted more like a policeman and therefore more emphasis was placed on training to enable him to act alone.|$|E
