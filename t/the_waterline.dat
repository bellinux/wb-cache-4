5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes {{were to be}} carried. Four {{of these}} would be mounted inside the hull below <b>the</b> <b>waterline,</b> two at {{either side of the}} bow; the others would be above <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> at the stern, two at either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E
5|$|The second shell struck above <b>the</b> <b>waterline,</b> in the aft engine room, {{killing all}} the sailors inside and damaged the {{internal}} communication {{system of the}} ship.|$|E

5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, De Soto {{continued}} {{to serve with}} the Navy, mostly in South American waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. She caught fire and was burned to <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> in December 1870.|$|E
5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} {{seakeeping}} of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the Connecticut class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament {{too close to}} <b>the</b> <b>waterline.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{on the way}} to the Quarantine Station in New York, Havana rammed the {{anchored}} Munson Line freighter Cubana {{which was}} hidden from sight behind , also at anchor.

5|$|Laid down {{nearly four}} years after Vittorio Veneto and Littorio, Roma was able to {{incorporate}} a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give Roma additional freeboard; partway into construction, it was modified {{on the basis of}} experience with Vittorio Veneto so that it had had a finer end at <b>the</b> <b>waterline.</b> She was also equipped with thirty-two rather than twenty-four /65 caliber Breda guns.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{ships of}} her class, Habsburg was 113.11m (371ft) long at <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> and was 114.55m (375ft 10in) in overall length. She had {{a beam of}} 19.8m (65ft) and a draft of 7.5m (24ft 6in). The ship {{displaced}} 8,364metric tons (8,232long tons). Habsburg had a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|New Hampshire {{conducted}} training {{exercises in}} the Atlantic and Caribbean through late 1910. On 1 November that year, she steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Second Battleship Division for a visit to Europe. There, the ships stopped in Cherbourg, France and Weymouth, the United Kingdom. The Division departed Weymouth on 30 December {{and returned to the}} Caribbean for training, before proceeding to Norfolk on 10 March 1911. On 2122 March, New Hampshire conducted gunnery training with the target ship San Marcosthe old battleship in Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. Over the course of the two days of firing, New Hampshire inflicted severe damage to the old ship, sinking her in shallow water. A cursory inspection of the wreck noted that the interior of the ship above <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> was destroyed and that she had been holed multiple times below <b>the</b> <b>waterline.</b>|$|E

40|$|The risk of infections via dental sprays {{has been}} {{confirmed}} once again by the detection, inside dental unit waterlines, of bacterial and viral contaminations, both from water supplies and from the oral cavity of patients. Conventional means of prevention, flushing of the ducts before any dental treatment and anti-retraction devices intended to avoid contamination originating from the patient, evaluated in laboratory and clinical conditions, {{have been shown to}} be ineffective in controlling the risk. Tests carried out in vitro, with circuit models, and with the dental unit in service, have confirmed the efficacy of a method to disinfect <b>the</b> <b>waterlines</b> with a disinfecting solution based on TAED and Peroxidant, which in aqueous solution develop peracetic ions (Autosteril method). Zero bacterial count, zero viral charge and a complete biofilm demolition were achieved both in lab conditions and in service units. After hygienic treatment, the same disinfection method, once installed on old units that had been in service for years and without any hygienic device, allowed us to restore and to maintain the microbiological quality of the irrigant also in dental units of old design, and significantly reduced biofilm formation inside <b>the</b> <b>waterlines.</b> Therefore, on <b>the</b> basis of scientific findings, a microbiologic monitoring protocol is proposed in order to verify the hygienic conditions of units which are in service...|$|R
5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} of {{the power}} plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and convert Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905. Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overweight ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below <b>the</b> <b>waterline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located too close to <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{main battery}} {{plotting}} room was located below <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> {{and inside the}} armored belt.

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{surveys of the}} ship {{indicate}} that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support {{to the idea that}} the Mary Rose was altered too much to be properly seaworthy. Marsden has suggested that the weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her draught so much that <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> was less than one metre (c. 3 feet) from the gunports on the main deck.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery plotting rooms were down below <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> {{and inside the}} armor belt. They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax correctors, a switchboard, and crew to operate it all.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric {{rangefinders}} that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually <b>the</b> <b>waterline</b> and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret.|$|E

500|$|Another test {{conducted}} {{somewhere around}} this time involved a [...] gun firing a shell at Tosa.

50|$|After the Second World War, the N.Y.Y.C. {{amended the}} Deed by {{changing}} <b>the</b> requirement regarding <b>waterline</b> length: <b>the</b> minimum <b>waterline</b> length was reduced from 65 ft to 44 ft {{to allow the}} use of the 12-metre class. In addition, the rule that the challenging boat had to sail on her own bottom {{to the site of the}} match was eliminated, permitting boats to be shipped to the venue without requiring them to be able to sail across oceans (or contain living accommodations).|$|R
5|$|Titanics lower decks {{were divided}} into sixteen {{compartment}}s.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage.
