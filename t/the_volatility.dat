5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The notch {{is a result of}} extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to <b>the</b> <b>volatility</b> of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>volatility</b> of the Dominican {{situation}} was severe at the time: Luperón fought a guerrilla {{war against the}} Spanish and Santana and became vice-president of the country (in 1863), only to be exiled to Saint Thomas because of his opposition to president Buenaventura Báez' wishes to annex {{the country to the}} United States (in 1864), to later return, provoke a coup d'état and be part of a three-way presidency (1866), only to be exiled once again (1868). Whenever Luperón was in the Dominican Republic, Betances could use it as a base of operations for his later political and military objectives, while offering Luperón logistical and financial assistance in return.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>volatility</b> of the Maltese tourism {{market in}} the past has been largely due to trends in the {{preferences}} of tourists from the United Kingdom, who comprise Malta's largest tourism market. Although Malta's uniform use of English, its traditional ties to the United Kingdom and low-cost travel options have made it an attractive option to British tourists, changing preferences of these tourists can impact Malta's tourism income quite significantly. For example, the increasing preference of British tourists for Spanish destinations during the 1980s was reflected in a drop in Malta's tourism numbers during that period.|$|E

5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. <b>The</b> <b>volatility</b> of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine <b>the</b> <b>volatility</b> of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} for pricing options on assets with stochastic volatility. We start by taking as given the prices of a few simple, liquid European options. More specifically, we take as given the “surface ” of Black-Scholes implied volatilities for European options with varying strike prices and maturities. We show that <b>the</b> Black-Scholes implied <b>volatilities</b> of at-the-money options converge to the underlying asset’s instantaneous (stochastic) <b>volatility</b> as <b>the</b> time to maturity goes to zero. We model the stochastic processes followed by <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities</b> of options of all maturities and strike prices as a joint diffusion with the stock price. In order for no arbitrage opportunities to exist in trading the stock and these options, the drift of the processes followed by <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities</b> is constrained {{in such a way}} that it is fully characterized by <b>the</b> <b>volatilities</b> of <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities.</b> Finally, we suggest how to use the arbitrage-free joint process for the stock price and its volatility to price other derivatives, such as standard but illiquid options as well as exotic options, using numerical methods. Our approach simply requires as inputs the stock price and <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities</b> at <b>the</b> time the exotic option is to be priced, as well as estimates of <b>the</b> <b>volatilities</b> of <b>the</b> implied <b>volatilities.</b> Key Words: stochastic volatility, Black-Scholes, implied volatility, options 1...|$|R
