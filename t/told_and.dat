5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron <b>told,</b> <b>and</b> despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been <b>told</b> <b>and</b> retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing coca as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s. Gagnon {{said that he would}} leave the mission if the people entered the cocaine trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and {{sent a letter to the}} Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was <b>told,</b> <b>and</b> heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{school has}} {{developed}} a specific program focus that includes film, photography, writing, and art, using Gordon Parks's life as an inspiration and guide. In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project. The students {{learn more about the}} neighborhood's history, document stories of the LRT project that might not otherwise be <b>told,</b> <b>and</b> share images that might not otherwise be seen.|$|E

5000|$|... 2.12 When I was Head of Group Regulatory Risk at HBOS, I {{certainly}} {{knew that}} the bank was going too fast (<b>and</b> <b>told</b> them), had a cultural indisposition to challenge (<b>and</b> <b>told</b> them) <b>and</b> was a serious risk to financial stability (what the FSA call [...] "Maintaining Market Confidence") and consumer protection (<b>and</b> <b>told</b> them).|$|R

5|$|While {{sound in}} theory, it proved much more {{difficult}} in practice. Inexperience <b>told</b> <b>and</b> by December 1940 NGJ 2 had lost 32 aircrew killed in action and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF aircraft claimed shot down. Despite the claims made by German crews, evidence showed {{a considerable amount of}} over claiming, and the difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over enemy territory became evident.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{started the}} second half in attacking fashion, as they had chances immediately. A Silvestre run down the pitch {{resulted}} in a pass that found Van Nistelrooy {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area, but his shot went high and wide of the goal. He had another chance a minute later, but despite beating the offside trap set by the Liverpool defence, he could not beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. United's attacking start to the half was underlined by a third chance in as many minutes, but Scholes' shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. However, two minutes later, United's pressure <b>told</b> <b>and</b> they scored. A move that involved Beckham, Keane and Ryan Giggs resulted in the ball being played to Van Nistelrooy, who went around Westerveld and subsequently scored to reduce Liverpool's lead to 2–1. Beckham came close to levelling the match in the 62nd minute when he had two chances to score; he was unable to get his shot on target after Liverpool failed to clear a cross from Giggs and he was unable to score with a long-range shot.|$|E
5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously <b>told,</b> <b>and</b> that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Siddharth {{was because of}} the sheer {{relevance}} to the character in real life. However, they finalized the choice of the actor only after the script was ready. The choice of Genelia was based on her natural vivacity in real life. This and her eyes, according to Bhaskar, made her an obvious choice for her character. More so, she liked the one line story that Raju <b>told</b> <b>and</b> also a few scenes that he narrated to her. She immediately liked the character and consented for the role. The fact that her co-actor, Siddharth and she acted earlier together in Boys (2003), made them more comfortable to work with. The camaraderie that the lead actors shared during the filming, added to their good performances. The choice of Prakash Raj was easy as he befitted the character he portrayed while, Jayasudha was persuaded {{to play the role of}} the lead actor's mother.|$|E

25|$|Stoneman and Black are Montag's {{coworkers}} at the firehouse.

25|$|Storytelling {{also serves}} {{to deliver a}} {{particular}} message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes {{more important than the}} time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are <b>told</b> <b>and</b> retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.|$|E
25|$|Men's {{clothing}} {{is seen as}} formal and stiff, women's as elaborate and over-done. Clothing covered the entire body, we are <b>told,</b> <b>and</b> even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.|$|E
