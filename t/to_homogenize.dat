5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration <b>to</b> <b>homogenize</b> the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E

In this model, Indigenous, African-descendent, and poor women occupy the periphery and must accept the ideas and conceptualization of feminism as defined by those at the centre. In other words, we Indigenous women are expected to accept the dominant picture of what constitutes women's oppression and women's liberation. [...] The trouble is, this picture is only a partial match with our own experiences. Elements of our experience that do not match this picture are denied or marginalized. This dominant model tries <b>to</b> <b>homogenize</b> the women's movement, claiming that all women have the same demands and the same access to the enjoyment of their rights.

2500|$|The {{answer is}} that {{nonlinearity}} enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. [...] But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking [...] [...] So if [...] is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. [...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate. [...] But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect <b>to</b> <b>homogenize</b> the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. [...] In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not {{to turn it into a}} flat Euclidean geometry.|$|E

Microstructural {{evolutions}} of AZ 91 magnesium alloy, which applied <b>to</b> <b>homogenizing</b> annealing treatment, hot extrusion and {{ageing treatment}} respectively, are investigated in this paper. Results exhibit that the massive β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase {{appearing in the}} initial structure dissolves to eliminate in α-Mg matrix mostly due <b>to</b> the <b>homogenizing</b> annealing treatment; dynamic recrystallization and consequent grain refinement occur during extrusion; banded structure, in which the β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase precipitates parallel to the extrusion direction in α-Mg matrix, are observed in the ageing treated specimen. Furthermore, the effects of temperature, keeping time of homogenizing annealing treatment and ageing treatment, and the extrusion processing parameter on the microstructural evolution of this alloy are also discussed according to the experimental results in details. In addition, the various mechanisms of the morphology and quantity of α-Mg and β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase are analyzed corresponded to the various states. As for the banded structure appearing in the ageing treated specimen, it {{can be attributed to}} the banded segregation which remained in the extruded one and resulted from the casting dendrite and subsequent extrusion...|$|R

Many inexpensive computations with the smallest RVE size and the largest coarse mesh are combined with fewer expensive computations performed on larger RVEs and smaller coarse meshes.
