There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} {{both public and}} {{political}} pressure, the provincial government announced in February2006 that it would begin twinning the entire two-lane portion of the highway from Atmore to {{the south end of}} Fort McMurray, the stretch they deemed to be the most dangerous. [...] Work began in 2006 and was estimated to take at least five years to complete. [...] The first section was completed in 2008 at a cost of $53million, stretching south from Airport Road (then Highway69) to a point south of the Highway881 intersection. [...] The Mariana Lakes Country Store near Mariana Lake was closed in September2008 {{to make way for the}} twinning. [...] It was the only service station between Wandering River and Fort McMurray, but Alberta Transportation had no other options due to the proximity of the lake and utilities.

The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album.

2500|$|Over the years, Lucas often {{exaggerated the}} amount of {{material}} he wrote for the series; much of the exagerations stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon.
