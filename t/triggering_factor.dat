25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} <b>triggering</b> <b>factor.</b> It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E

40|$|KEY WORDS: slope failure, inverse and decompositional analysis, chain <b>trigger</b> <b>factors,</b> {{structural}} equation modelling, satellite remotely sensed data, geographical information This paper presents an inverse- and decompositional-analysis of unobserved “chain-trigger factors ” according to slope failure, based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Quantitative prediction models for slope failures generally elucidate {{the relationship between}} past slope failures and causal factors (e. g. geology, soil, slope, aspect, etc.). Due to the difficulties of obtaining pixel-based observations on the <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> (e. g. rainfall, earthquake, weathering, etc.), the <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> as explanatory variables are substituted {{for some of the}} causal factors in constructing prediction models, on the assumption that there are some correlations between causal and <b>trigger</b> <b>factors.</b> As a measure, we had tackled to construct a <b>Trigger</b> <b>Factor</b> Inverse analysis model (TFI model) in which the relationship between past slope failures (i. e. endogenous variables), causal factors (i. e. explanatory variables), and <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> (i. e. unobserved variables) are delineated on the path diagram in SEM approach. In the TFI model, through the “measurement equation ” defined between the causal factors (i. e. observed variables) and the <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> (i. e. unobserved latent variable), the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> can be inversely estimated. As the subsequent subjects for the previous studies, in this contribution, we have tried to decompose <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> into the “ 1 st <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> ” and the “ 2 nd <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> ” with respect to slope failures, which had been induced by Niigata Heavy Rainfall (Jul. 13, 2004 :Case 1) and Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake (Oct. 23, 2004 :Case 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Migraine is a {{recurrent}} primary headache disorder characterized by different clinical presentations. Migraneurs report excessive sensitivity to light, sound, motion, odours, and other sensory stimuli in and between acute migraine attacks. This study was undertaken to document different <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> and {{to evaluate the}} differences in episodic and chronic migraine forms. Headache <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were questioned in 190 patients. Methods: Headache <b>triggering</b> <b>factors</b> were questioned in 190 patients. A set of questions concerning the <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were prepared and {{the information about the}} <b>triggering</b> <b>factors</b> was collected by a structured interview. All the patients were administered Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All analyses in this study were performed by NCSS 2007 packet programme.

The headaches with <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with greater pain intensity (p< 0. 001), headache-related disability (p< 0. 001), abortive medication use (p = 0. 02), and the proportion of migraine (p < 0. 001), relative to those without <b>trigger</b> <b>factors.</b> Traveling (odd ratios [OR]: 6. 4), hormonal changes (OR: 3. 5), noise (OR: 2. 8), alcohol (OR: 2. 5), overeating (OR: 2. 4), and stress (OR: 1. 8) were significantly associated with migraines compared to non-migraine headaches.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an inverse}} analysis of unobserved <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> according to “slope failure types ” based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Quantitative prediction models generally elucidate {{the relationship between}} past slope failures and causal factors (e. g., geology, topography, soil, slope, aspect, drainage, land cover, etc.), but do not consider <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> (e. g., rail fall, earthquake, weathering, etc.), due to difficulties in pixel-by-pixel observations of <b>trigger</b> <b>factors.</b> As one of the measures, an inverse analysis algorithm on <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> has been proposed according to the following steps: � Step 1 : The relationship between past slope failures (i. e., the endogenous variables), causal and <b>trigger</b> <b>factors</b> (i. e. the exogenous variables) are delineated on the path diagram used in SEM approach, � Step 2 : The regression weights in the path diagram are estimated based on the maximum likelihood estimation procedure; and � Step 3 : Through the “measurement equation ” defined between the causal factors (i. e., observed variables) and the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> (i. e., unobserved latent variable), the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> is inversely estimated, and a <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> influence (TFI) map is also produced.

In its enzymatic mechanism the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> follows the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Danish folk dances are made for social- and educational purposes, generally speaking not for exhibitional purposes.The canonized history of Danish folk dance highlights a performance by Philochoros in Copenhagen in 1899 with some Danish students in the audience as a <b>triggering</b> <b>factor.</b> The students were immediately so inspired that they started a folk dance club. In 1901 some of the same students who were now students of gymnastics founded a formal organization, the Danish Association for the Promotion of Folk-Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme). The number of folk dance organizations and societies continued to grow throughout Denmark for the following two decades. Danish Folk-Dancers was established in 1929 and is an organization that still arranges courses for folk dancers, and every year folk dance festivals are organized. The effect of all of this had led to a certain uniformity in the performance of the Danish folk dances, thus reducing regional differences between local dances and traditions within Denmark. These societies and organizations also contributed to help preserve the Danish traditional costume as well as the folk dance. These groups produces journals, books, photographs, recipes, costumes, props, and other cultural artifacts as well. They organized demonstrations, theatrical exhibitions, festivals, open houses for dancing, and other social events.|$|E

Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} <b>triggering</b> <b>factor.</b> It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E

Our data indicate, however, that this strand may be partially structured as "nascent" beta strand. This makes the <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> PPIase domain the most minimal representative of the FKBP like protein family of PPIases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To identify cellular factors {{involved in the}} initial stages of this process we searched for proteins associated with nascent polypeptide chains. In an Escherichia coli transcription/translation system synthesizing beta-galactosidase we identified a 58 -kDa protein which associated with translating ribosomes but dissociated from these ribosomes upon release of nascent beta-galactosidase. N-terminal sequencing identified it as <b>trigger</b> <b>factor,</b> previously implicated in protein secretion. Direct evidence for association of <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> with nascent polypeptide chains was obtained by crosslinking. In a wheat germ translation system complemented with E. coli lysates, epsilon- 4 -(3 -trifluoromethyldiazirino) benzoic acid-lysine residues were incorporated into nascent secretory preprolactin and a nonsecretory preprolactin mutant. <b>Trigger</b> <b>factor</b> crosslinked to both types of nascent chains, provided they were ribosome bound. <b>Trigger</b> <b>factor</b> contains key residues of the substrate-binding pocket of FK 506 -binding protein-type peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases and has prolyl isomerase activity in vitro. We propose that <b>trigger</b> <b>factor</b> is a folding catalyst acting cotranslationally...|$|R
