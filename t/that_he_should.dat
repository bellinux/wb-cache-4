5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In 627, Khosrow sent Shahrbaraz a letter, {{which said}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> send his army to Ctesiphon. Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, {{and moved to}} Asuristan, where {{he set up a}} camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to {{negotiate}} with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz.|$|E

60|$|One morning, accordingly, when {{alone with}} the count, he said to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> feared <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have to leave for England in a few days, and it was {{probable}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> shortly join his ship.|$|R
60|$|He went on packing, {{and putting}} {{away with the}} {{different}} garments the unpleasant thoughts <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be sure to unpack with them in Rome; but they would then have less poignancy.|$|R
5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of Quatermass's early life {{during the course}} of the films and television series in which he appears. In The Quatermass Experiment, he at one point despairs <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have stuck to his original career as a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E
5000|$|On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Paul said he forewent Secret Service {{protection}} {{because he}} considered it [...] "a form of welfare" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{pay for his}} own protection.|$|R

5000|$|Every impenitent sinner {{should be}} willing to suffer the {{punishment}} that God wills to inflict upon him. In whatever sense <b>he</b> <b>should</b> submit to the divine justice punishing other sinners, in <b>that</b> sense <b>he</b> <b>should</b> submit to the divine justice punishing himself. In whatever sense the punishment of the finally obdurate promotes the highest good of the universe, in <b>that</b> sense <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be submissive to the divine will in punishing himself, if finally obdurate. This principle is founded mainly on the two following.|$|R
5|$|Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon Snow House Mormont's ancestral Valyrian steel sword Longclaw, {{which was}} {{originally}} meant {{for his son}} Ser Jorah before Jorah's exile, {{as a reward for}} saving his life from the undead ranger. Jon is upset, however, when Sam tells him about Robb's war against the Lannisters, feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be there to help Robb.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was born}} in Highbury, London. When he was six, Martin's family {{acquired}} a piano that sparked his interest in music. At eight years of age, Martin persuaded his parents, Henry and Betha Beatrice (nėe Simpson) Martin, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take piano lessons, but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher.|$|E
5|$|Peter brings Simpson {{home with}} him to meet the family, who are {{initially}} less tolerant of Simpson than Peter. Brian tries to tell Peter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not trust Simpson just because he idolized him as a child but Peter refuses.|$|E

5|$|Sella confessed his doping to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) {{and named}} {{teammate}} Matteo Priamo, also a stage winner in this Giro, as his supplier.

5|$|After Leif's {{first trip}} to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders. His father Erik reacted coldly to the suggestion <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> abandon his religion, while his mother Thjóðhildr quickly became a Christian and built a church called Thjóðhild's Church. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates. Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain.|$|E
5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, Marco met Forester on the stairs, as he {{was coming}} down to breakfast, and told him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>should</b> feel better to be punished.
