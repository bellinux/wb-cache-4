25|$|The Đại Việt won a hard-fought {{victory and}} {{continued}} north to threaten Muang Sua. King Chakkaphat {{and the court}} fled south toward Vientiane along the Mekong. The Đại Việt took the capital of Luang Prabang, and then divided their forces to create a pincer attack. One branch continued west taking Sipsong Panna and threatening Lanna and another force headed south along the Mekong toward Vientiane. King Tilok and Lanna preemptively destroyed the northern army, and the forces around Vientiane rallied under King Chakkaphat's younger son Prince Thaen Kham. The combined forces destroyed the Đại Việt army, which fled {{in the direction of}} Muang Phuan. Although numbering only about 4,000 the Đại Việt <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> attempt at revenge and destroyed the Muang Phuan capital before retreating.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Wetzel's terrible temptation, his heart-racking {{struggle}} ceased. He {{lowered the}} long, black rifle. He <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> {{look at the}} chieftain's dark, powerful face.|$|E
60|$|Harding hesitated. He glanced savagely at Smoke, saw Pierre beckoning to Louis {{from the}} doorway, <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> {{look at the}} lump-gold on the table, and decided.|$|E
50|$|Adama {{returns to}} his {{quarters}} and <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at his wedding photo before putting it back inside his locker.|$|R
50|$|The couple <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> desperate try {{to revive}} their passion and save their relationship. They travel to California {{to join a}} sex-therapy group, where much goes wrong, but all ends well.|$|R
5000|$|John and Donner {{have enough}} money for two bus tickets to Branson but John <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> [...] "date" [...] to earn money for expenses. After their sexual {{encounter}} at a motel, however, John's [...] "date" [...] turns violent, beating John unmercifully.|$|R
60|$|They <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> {{long look}} into each others' eyes. Jim's glance betrayed his fear--he {{would never see}} his brother again. The light in Joe's eyes was the old steely flash, the indomitable spirit--while there was life there was hope.|$|E
60|$|Then {{gathered}} together the shipwrecked crew And <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> embrace, While sorrowful tears from despairing eyes Ran down each hopeless face; And some did {{think of their}} little ones Whom they never more might see, And others of waiting wives at home, And mothers that grieved would be.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{we were in}} {{the green}} country, and I <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> glance back at the smoke-filled sky. Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion. Then I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept softly for the Cause that was lost. Ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't bother about me!" [...] Harry replied; {{and then}} as the flames came nearer he plunged into the sea, Joe {{lingering}} a few seconds longer, as if to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at the little craft he had {{tried so hard to}} save.|$|R
5|$|Voyager 1, {{which had}} {{completed}} its primary mission and {{was leaving the}} Solar System, was commanded by NASA to turn its camera around and <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> photograph of Earth across a great expanse of space, {{at the request of}} astronomer and author Carl Sagan.|$|R
60|$|Reader! <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> leap with me, and {{presume that}} two years have flown from us {{since the end of}} the last chapter; or rather {{somewhat}} more than two years, for we would have it high midsummer when we take our last farewell of Surbiton Cottage.|$|R
60|$|The sharp {{click of}} his teeth, like the snap of a steel trap, {{completed}} the sentence. Joe said no more, but followed the hunter into the woods. Stopping near a fallen tree, Wetzel raked up {{a bundle of}} leaves and spread them on the ground. Then he cut a few spreading branches from a beech, and leaned them against a log. Bidding the lad crawl in before he <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look around and then made his way under the shelter.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he remembered}} {{something}} more. He {{took hold of}} the right arm. He was convinced that it had been broken during that desperate struggle in the darkness. He felt it carefully and listened. He heard plainly the two parts of the bone rub against one another. The dead man's arm was broken just in the place where he had broken it. Arthur stood up. He <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at his enemy. That vast mass of flesh lay heaped up on the floor in horrible disorder.|$|E
60|$|They now {{decided that}} they must {{continue}} their journey, and as neither Sacho nor King Joe could ascend {{to the top of}} the dome without swimming in the human way, which was slow and tedious work for them, the goodbyes were said at the castle entrance, and the four visitors started on their return. Trot <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> view of the beautiful silver castle from the hole high up in the dome, which was now open and unguarded, and the next moment she was in the broad ocean again, swimming toward home beside her mermaid friends.|$|E
50|$|In a post-credits scene, amongst a {{field with}} countless {{number of blades}} {{embedded}} into the ground, Ryu plants Genshin's Blade of the Archfiend {{into the ground and}} bows in respect for the Black Spider Overlord. The Dragon Ninja <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look before taking off into the fog.|$|R
50|$|Dows Corn Days in 2014 {{was held}} as an all-school reunion. The school {{building}} was opened <b>one</b> <b>last</b> time for past alumni, students, teachers, staff, {{and community members}} to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look. The building was full of people reminiscing of years gone. The football field {{will be used to}} host a fireworks display at Dows Corn Days starting in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Alice's parents, {{whom she}} had seen earlier in Dr. Stringer's office, come {{to take her home}} because she is finally fully treated. After {{gathering}} her belongings, Alice <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look around her room. Upon opening the medicine cabinet, Kristen suddenly comes out and attacks her. The camera cuts to black.|$|R
60|$|What we did {{we had to}} do {{quickly and}} secretly, since even at this last hour the Indians might hold us back. Our stores we would leave behind us, save only our guns and cartridges. But Challenger had some {{unwieldy}} stuff which he ardently desired to take with him, and one particular package, of which I may not speak, which gave us more labor than any. Slowly the day passed, but when the darkness fell we were ready for our departure. With much labor we got our things up the steps, and then, looking back, <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> long survey of that strange land, soon I fear to be vulgarized, the prey of hunter and prospector, but to each of us a dreamland of glamour and romance, a land where we had dared much, suffered much, and learned much--OUR land, as we shall ever fondly call it. Along upon our left the neighboring caves each threw out its ruddy cheery firelight into the gloom. From the slope below us rose the voices of the Indians as they laughed and sang. Beyond was the long sweep of the woods, and in the center, shimmering vaguely through the gloom, was the great lake, the mother of strange monsters. Even as we looked a high whickering cry, the call of some weird animal, rang clear out of the darkness. It was the very voice of Maple White Land bidding us good-bye. We turned and plunged into the cave which led to home.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Satterlee {{was as good}} as his word, for he {{was seated}} in the stage when it drew up at the tannery house, ready to go to Brampton. And as they drove away Cynthia <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at Jethro {{standing}} on the porch. It seemed to her that it had been given her to feel all things, and to know all things: to know, especially, this strange man, Jethro Bass, as none other knew him, and to love him as none other loved him. The last severe wrench was come, and she had left him standing there alone in the cold, divining what was in his heart as though it were in her own. How worthless was this mighty power which he had gained, how hateful, when he could not bestow the smallest fragment of it upon one whom he loved? Someone has described hell as disqualification in the face of opportunity. Such was Jethro's torment that morning as he saw her drive away, the minister in the place where he should have been, at her side, and he, Jethro Bass, as helpless as though he had indeed been in the pit among the flames. Had the prudential committee at Brampton promised the appointment ten times over, he might still have obtained it for her by a word. And he must not speak even that word. Who shall say that {{a large part of the}} punishment of Jethro Bass did not come to him in the life upon this earth.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, on the {{compilation}} QBs Finest (a {{showcase of}} Queensbridge hip hop artists), MC Shan <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> parting shot at KRS-One with the comment: ...|$|E

The version on Gotta <b>Take</b> That <b>One</b> <b>Last</b> Ride contains additional instrumental and vocal overdubs by Brian Wilson and American Spring in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Childhood friends Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, {{along with}} Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neil, spend a Sunday {{afternoon}} at a New England ski resort on Mount Holliston. They {{are eager to}} <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.|$|R
5000|$|As Adelle, Caroline, Zone, and the {{residents}} wait outside, Topher arrives in Adelle's old office and assembles the device. He <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> {{look around and}} spots the [...] "To Remember" [...] wall. The device goes off causing an explosion and sending a pulse out. The residents and Caroline collapse, awaking shortly with their original personalities.|$|R
5000|$|The band <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> tour [...] "Toumeihanzai" [...] before Hide and Yukine left on 6.26. This was a {{fan club}} only tour. The last concert with all the members was {{recorded}} and later released {{as a set of}} two DVDs through the fan club.|$|E
5000|$|... "With {{no hope of}} Huey's survival, {{his family}} and a few close {{political}} allies gathered at his bedside. Just after four on Tuesday morning and thirty-one hours after being shot, Huey Long, worshipped by {{tens of thousands of}} Louisianans and despised by tens of thousands more, thrashed briefly in his oxygen tent, <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> labored breath, and died." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gross {{also refused}} to go on taxpayer-funded congressional junkets. As Ed Rollins recalled, [...] "When he retired, his fellow members chipped in and bought {{him and his wife}} Hazel, who managed his office for no pay, a round-the-world trip. With tears in his eyes he <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> shot at his pals. 'Wherever we go, I am sure I'll see you all on your taxpayers' junkets! ...|$|E
50|$|Ted hears that a pizzeria in Chicago, Gazola's, {{is closing}} down. He and Marshall {{used to drive}} {{straight}} from Wesleyan to the pizzeria while in college, even though the pizza was awful. The road trips cemented their friendship, and Ted proposes they <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> trip. Pumped to spend some personal time with Marshall, Ted is disappointed that Lily is coming along.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the same day, Angélique was <b>taken</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> time through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her amende honorable mounted a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire and there was hanged, then strangled until dead, her body flung into the fire and the ashes scattered in the wind.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Bechard {{decided to}} <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> stab at filmmaking. He {{would do a}} micro-budget film where all the control was in his hands. The film, You Are Alone, a dark drama {{exploring}} how far some people will go to feel less alone, went on to play numerous film festivals and win many [...] "best-of" [...] awards before being released on DVD.|$|R
50|$|Thutmose <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> {{campaign}} in his fiftieth regnal year, very {{late in his}} life. He attacked Nubia, but only {{went so far as}} the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated so far as he did with an army, previous kings' campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal, in fact, comes from three years before Thutmose's campaign.|$|E
5000|$|LA 8 is {{referred}} to as the Nolan Trace after Philip Nolan. The adventurer that traveled the road to Texas and back many times <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> trip through Burr Ferry in 1801. This ill fated trip ended in east Texas with the death of Philip, by the Royal Spanish army, and the capture of his expedition numbered to be around 20. Peter Ellis Bean. [...] was among the group captured and wrote about it later.|$|E
50|$|Allan was {{the second}} aide to B5 Chief of Security Michael Garibaldi from 2259-2261. Following Garibaldi's {{resignation}} as chief of security in season 4, Allan was appointed Chief of Security. He held the position for many years; except for a brief stint back on Earth, he remained there until the station was decommissioned in 2281. Because of this, {{he was the only}} one not to receive his invitation to Sheridan's farewell party in Sleeping in Light, though Allan would still meet Sheridan one more time as Sheridan <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> walk through the station.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|R
5000|$|Movement five is the finale. It {{begins with}} a {{slightly}} altered version of the [...] "Crocodile Chorus", and recaps the various other movements of the piece. It ends with the soloist flutter tonguing a very loud note while spinning around in circles. This creates a sinusoidal sound effect, with a rising and falling volume. The soloist <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> gasp for air and harmonizes with the orchestra on a final note that fades into silence.|$|R
5000|$|Later that evening, as {{he leads}} the nuns in singing [...] "Amen" [...] once again, Smith slips out the door and, still singing the lead, the nuns' voices chiming softly behind him, he <b>takes</b> <b>one</b> <b>last</b> look at the chapel he built. Mother Maria hears him start up his station wagon, but remains stolidly in her seat, singing {{along with the rest}} of the sisters, as Smith drives quietly off into the night.|$|R
