40|$|Modern {{multiprocessor}} systems use weak (relaxed) memory {{models in}} order to execute memory sharing multi-threaded code in an efficient manner, but are much harder for programmers to reason about than systems using the sequential consistency memory model. The SB abstraction and its implementation in the Memorax tool allows sound and complete checking of control state reachability under the TSO memory model, used in modern x 86 processors. In this paper, I present a formalisation of the PSO memory model using the semantics of the Sun SPARC documentation and an alternate semantic, called Partial Write Serialisation, I conjecture <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equivalent <b>with</b> <b>my</b> formalisation under the control state reachability problem.
