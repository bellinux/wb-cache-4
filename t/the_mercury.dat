5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mercury</b> {{battery is}} a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary cell, that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. <b>The</b> <b>mercury</b> cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> contaminating landfills.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1955-56 season, <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> {{played some}} home games in Marion, Ohio at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, hence being known as <b>the</b> Toledo-Marion <b>Mercurys.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> split home games between arenas {{again for the}} 1959-60 season. <b>The</b> Toledo-St. Louis <b>Mercurys</b> played some home games in St. Louis, Missouri at the St. Louis Arena.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, {{the team}} donned <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> moniker. They {{made it back}} to the OHA Senior A final again in 1951 to beat a team from Sarnia 4-games-to-2. <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> pushed on to the Allan Cup final where they faced the Fort Frances Canadians. The Canadians drove all the way from Fort Frances, Ontario on the Manitoba border to compete with <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> at <b>the</b> Centennial Arena. <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> won game one and the Canadians pulled even in game two. Game three went to <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> and again <b>the</b> Canadians {{answered}} in game four. With the momentum, the Canadians broke the pattern and won game five to take their first series lead. <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> had their backs to the wall, with one more loss the National Championship would go to Fort Frances. In game six, <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> came out blazing and defeated the Canadians 7-4 to force a game seven. The seventh game was low scoring, but this played to Owen Sound's favour as they took the game 3-1, the series 4-games-to-3, and the Canadian Senior National Championship. The team's championship photo can be seen at the Bayshore Community Centre's Sports Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>Mercury,</b> {{operating}} on a daily roundtrip between Cleveland and Detroit, was introduced on July 13, 1936. <b>The</b> Chicago <b>Mercury,</b> between Chicago and Detroit, and <b>the</b> Cincinnati <b>Mercury,</b> between Cincinnati and Detroit, followed. <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> lasted until <b>the</b> 1950s, with the final survivor, <b>the</b> original Cleveland <b>Mercury,</b> making its last run on July 11, 1959.|$|R
5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of <b>the</b> <b>mercury</b> were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{regarded}} {{by many as}} highly prestigious, {{it has been suggested}} that having an album nominated for or winning <b>the</b> <b>Mercury</b> Prize could be a curse on a career in music.|$|E

50|$|The 1953-54 season saw <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> {{push back}} to their fourth {{straight}} league final. In their way was the Stratford Indians. Unlike 1952, <b>the</b> <b>Mercurys</b> {{took it to the}} Indians and swept the series 4-games-to-none to win their second league title in four seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Mercurys</b> did not make it to the Allan Cup final in 1954, as the Eastern Championship went to the Northern Ontario Hockey Association's Sudbury Wolves.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mercury</b> Prize, {{formerly}} <b>the</b> <b>Mercury</b> Music Prize {{and currently}} {{known as the}} Nationwide Mercury Prize for sponsorship reasons, is an annual music prize awarded for the best album from the United Kingdom or Ireland.

Nominations are chosen by a selected panel of musicians, music executives, journalists and other figures in the music industry in the UK and Ireland. Winehouse received two nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{results of}} the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted {{compared with that of}} earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>Mercury</b> spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of <b>the</b> <b>Mercury</b> program.|$|E
