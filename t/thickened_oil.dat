40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of <b>thickened</b> <b>oil</b> thermal recovery, the {{pre-stress}} cementing needs to be anchored {{at the bottom of}} the casing pipe. And the reliable opening and closing of anchor flukes directly influence the anchoring. In allusion to the problems of how to get the critical value of drilling fluid flow rate of when the anchor flukes begin to open, completely open, begin to close and completely close, whether different nozzles can open or close reliably, getting the corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles, this paper conducts a study from both theory and experiment to obtain the relevant parameters. By simulating the anchor in actual work and dealing with the data, we conclude that: (1) The fluke can open smoothly when the flow rate reaches a certain flow and it can also close smoothly when the flow rate declines. (2) The critical flow rate of the flukes, when two kinds of anchors are with different nozzles, has been acquired. (3) Corresponding differential pressure and discharge coefficient of the different nozzles in different flow rate have been ascertained...|$|E

40|$|Soot {{mediated}} <b>oil</b> <b>thickening,</b> normally {{referred to}} asoilsoot, {{is a well}} known problem that can cause increased wearon lubricated moving or rubbing components in diesel engines. The ambition of this thesis is to understand the mechanisms ofcombustion and soot formation that {{pave the way for}} thisproblem and use this knowledge in the development of apredictive model for soot contamination of the oil. Anadditional task, however, is the use of Computational FluidDynamics (CFD) as the platform for development of the oilsootmodel. A preliminary hypothesis for soot contamination of the oilis formulated from a combination of theoretical reasoning andprevious experimental evaluations. This states that the oilsootgrowth rate is the result of particle deposition in the oilfilm on the cylinder liner, followed by scraping ofcontaminated oil to the crank case by the piston rings. Acontrolling factor here is assumed to be thermophoresis, whichhas been identified in the past as the dominating particletransport mechanism within the viscous sublayer at combustionchamber surfaces and hence governs the rate of particledeposition in the oil film on the liner. A thermophoretic particle deposition model is suggested forthe calculation of soot deposition on the liner from local sootdistribution as predicted by the standard CFD code. The modelis evaluated through parameter studies comprising the influenceof injection timing, liner temperature, topland height,injected fuel quantity, equivalence ratio, boost pressure andspeed, and the agreement between simulations and measurementsis generally good. It is concluded that the peak in-cylindersoot concentration is more important to oilsoot growth than theexhaust soot level. Moreover, changes in in-cylinder sootdistribution has strong effect on soot mediated <b>oil</b> <b>thickening.</b> Consequently, an important practical guideline to reduce sootmediated <b>oil</b> <b>thickening</b> is to end injection 9 ̆ 3 ontime 9 ̆ 4, i. e. before the spray guided diffusion flame isdirected into the squish region rather than into the pistonbowl.

Traditional escapements had to use lubricants but this eventually caused problems with accuracy as <b>oil</b> <b>thickened</b> over time.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new method}} has been developed, which determines the optical {{coefficients}} spectra (absorption and scattering) of small volumes of tissue (1 mm 3) by {{the measurement of}} spatially resolved reflectance between 480 and 950 nm. Firstly, an algorithm has been developed to determine the optical coefficients form reflectance measurements: It {{is based on the}} optical propagation model introduced by Bevilacqua [Bevilacqua 99 JOSA]. This model takes the first two moments of the phase function into account through the γ parameter, allowing to accurately simulate the propagation of photons close to the source by the Monte Carlo method. These simulations are then fitted to the reflectance to obtain the optical coefficients. To obtain any value of absorption, scattering or γ parameter, the simulations are interpolated by 3 D B-splines. A complete robustness to noise study of the algorithm has been presented. A theoretical study of the γ parameter in tissue over broad wavelengths has been reported. Tissue was simulated with Mie theory for a fractal distribution of sphere diameters. For such a distribution, the γ spectrum is almost flat, instead of being wavy like in the case of mono-disperse sphere diameter. The correlation of the mean value of γ with the fractal power (or dimension) of the distribution was made and showed an analytical form of hyperbolic tangent. It allowed deepening the interpretation of the γ parameter as being an indicator of the relative number of small scatterers (much smaller than the wavelength, e. g. of Rayleigh type) in comparison of bigger ones (their size being comparable to the wavelength). The assessment of the set-up and the algorithm was made by measuring the reflectance of a solution containing 5 different diameters of polystyrene spheres simulating the scattering and Nigrosin colorant as absorber. It showed a good agreement between measurements and prediction. In order to built a better comprehension of absorption and scattering at the tissue scale, a first part of in vivo investigations has been made on an animal model. The skin of the mouse back was altered with Freund's adjuvant and TPA and the optical coefficients were measured on treated and control sites. The effect of alteration (epidermis and dermis <b>thickening,</b> <b>oil</b> vesicle appearing, inflammatory cells infiltration, etc.) was clearly correlated with optical coefficients variations. The scattering spectrum always showed the better contrast. The absorption spectrum, especially in the haemoglobin peak region (between 550 and 600 nm) also showed significant information, in terms of oxy and deoxy-haemoglobin concentration and saturation. Sensitivity and specificity of the "diagnosis" was evaluated. The study of stomach epithelium in vivo on 29 human subjects was made using a small optical fibre probe (< 2 mm in diameter) through the working channel of an endoscope used in routine gastroscopic examination. An optical contrast in scattering and absorption was found between the antral (lower) part of the stomach and the fundus (upper part). In the antrum, gastritis cases were studied and showed a good optical contrast (100 % sensitivity and 78. 8 % of specificity). Indications on sub-types of gastritis are likely to be deduced from optical properties, but further measurements should be made to confirm this tendency. Because of its high sensitivity, the optical set-up and algorithm presented in this work has been found to give valuable indications to physicians to localise the interesting biopsy sites and may give on-time indications on the tissue pathology...|$|R

Various feed ratios of siloxane-based monomer and divinyl monomers were investigated. We showed that even at DVB concentrations as high as 80 mol % in the feed, 65 % yield of hyperbranched polymer could be obtained without gelation because the DE-ATRP suppressed the rapid formation of macronetwork structures.

Viscosity index improvers, antifoaming agents, emulsifiers, demulsifiers, and pour point depressants are examples {{of different kinds of}} additives. Most of the present day additives are synthetic acrylate based. But with increasing environmental awareness, the research in the area towards the synthesis of multifunctional biodegradable lubricating oil additive is increasing day by day. Hence, in our present work chemistry of biodegradable multifunctional lubricating oil additive based on vegetable oil (sunflower oil) has been investigated. In the present work solvent-free synthesis of homopolymer of sunflower oil was performed by two different ways; microwave irradiation method and thermal method using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. Characterization of the polymers was done by spectral (NMR, IR), GPC and viscometric analysis and finally performance evaluation was tested by standard ASTM methods. Performance evaluation as pour point depressant, viscosity modifier or viscosity index improver and antiwear in different base oils (BO 1, BO 2) was carried out by standard ASTM methods. Shear stability and <b>oil</b> <b>thickening</b> property of the polymers have also been investigated and reported here. Thermal stability of the polymers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. A comparison of their performances has also been reported. The additive prepared by microwave-assisted method showed better viscosity index and pour point values as compared to thermally prepared additive. Thus, polymerized sunflower oil may be used as a potential biodegradable lube oil additive and hence the microwave-assisted protocol may be considered as a cost-effective greener approach for synthesis of lube oil additive.|$|R

Each shuttle has four body flap actuators (BFAs) (two on each wing) on a common segmented shaft and four rudder speed brake (RSB) actuators. The actuators were designed to operate for 10 years and 100 flights without periodic relubrication. Visible inspection of two partially disassembled RSB actuators in continuous use for 19 years raised concerns over possible grease degradation due to discoloration of the grease on several places on the surfaces of the gears. Inspection revealed fretting, micropitting, wear and corrosion of the bearings and gears. A small amount of oil dripped from the disassembled actuators. Whereas new grease is beige in appearance, the discolored grease consisted of both grey and reddish colors. Grease samples taken from the actuators together with representative off-the-shelf new and unused grease samples were analyzed by gravimetry for oil content; by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) for metals content; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for base oil decomposition; and by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for determination of the molecular weight distributions of the grease oil. The Braycote 601 grease was stable after 19 years of continuous use in the sealed RSB actuators and was fit for its intended purpose. There were no significant chemical differences between the used grease samples and new and unused samples. Base oil separation was not significant within the sealed actuators. No corrosive effect {{in the form of}} iron fluoride was detected. The grey color of grease samples was due to metallic iron.

50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring detent and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the <b>oil</b> <b>thickens</b> through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|R

On {{the white}} surface thus prepared, the colors, ground finely with linseed oil, were applied, {{according}} to the advice of Theophilus, in not less than three successive coats, and finally protected with amber or sandarac varnish: each coat of color being carefully dried by the aid of heat or in the sun before a second was applied, and the entire work before varnishing. The practice of carefully drying each coat was continued in the best periods of art, but the necessity {{of exposure to the}} sun intimated by Theophilus appears to have arisen only from his careless preparation of the linseed oil, and ignorance of a proper drying medium. Consequent on this necessity is the restriction in Theophilus, St. Audemar, and in the British Museum MS., of oil-painting to wooden surfaces, because movable panels could be dried in the sun; while, for walls, the colors are to be mixed with water, wine, gum, or the usual tempera vehicles, egg and fig-tree juice; white lead and verdigris, themselves dryers, being the only pigments which could be mixed with oil for walls. But the MS. of Eraclius and the records of our English cathedrals imply no such absolute restriction. They mention the employment of oil for the painting or varnishing of columns and interior walls, and in quantity very remarkable.

And presently afterwards, in May of the same year, [...] "to John de Hennay, for seventy flagons and a half of painter's oil for the painting of the same chapel, at 20d. the flagon, 117s. 6d." [...] The expression [...] "painter's oil" [...] seems to imply more careful preparation than that directed by Theophilus, probably purification from its mucilage in the sun; but artificial heat was certainly employed to assist the drying, and after reading of flagons supplied by the score, we can hardly be surprised at finding charcoal furnished by the cartload--see an entry relating to the Painted Chamber. In one MS. of Eraclius, however, a distinct description of a drying oil in the modern sense, occurs, white lead and lime being added, and the <b>oil</b> <b>thickened</b> by exposure to the sun, as was the universal practice in Italy.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (pure vegetable oil). A feature of the Ricardo Comet pre-chamber design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for rotary injection pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>thicken</b> when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type coolant heated fuel filter that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing winterising agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, winterising additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|R
40|$|The {{rheology}} of OWC slurries {{is generally}} {{more complicated than}} that of conventional cement paste. In order to contend with bottom hole conditions (wide range of pressure and temperature), a number of additives are usually used in the OWC slurries and the slurry shows different characteristics depending on the combination of admixture used. The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding on the important mechanisms that affects the rheology of cement slurry incorporating various chemical and mineral admixtures. The thesis aimed at developing cement slurries by partial replacement of oil well cement using different mineral admixtures, offering both environmental and economic benefit. The mechanisms underlying the effect of chemical admixtures on the rheology of oil well cement slurry were investigated at different temperatures using an advanced shear-stress/shear-strain controlled rheometer. The compatibility and interactions between the binder and chemical admixtures were explored. It was found that the rheological properties of oil well cement slurries are highly dependent on temperature, water/cement ratio and the type of admixture used. Coupled effects of temperature and chemical admixtures had a substantial effect on the flow properties of the slurries. The results indicated that current technical data for chemical admixtures need to be validated for oil well cementing; admixtures proven effective in normal cementing job at moderate temperature may become ineffective for oil well cementing at high temperature. The coupled effects of temperature and supplementary cementing materials on the rheology of oil well cement slurry were also investigated. Because of differences in their chemical compositions and the mechanisms by which they act, cement slurries prepared with the addition of supplementary cementitious materials exhibit different rheological behaviour than those prepared with pure oil well cement. It was found that not all minerals/supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) act in the same way when used as replacement of cement. For example, Fly ash, owing to its spherical particle shape, reduces the water demand when used as a partial replacement of cement. On the other hand, silica fume increase the water demand by adsorbing water because of their higher surface area. However results suggested that new generation polycarboxylate-based high-range water reducing admixture (PCH) improved the rheological properties of all slurries at all temperature tested. However, lower dosage of PCH was found to be less efficient in reducing the yield stress or plastic viscosity of OWC slurries when metakaolin (MK) or rice husk ash (RHA) was used as replacement of cement. PCH was found to enhance the shear <b>thickening</b> behaviour of <b>oil</b> well cement slurries and the intensity of this behaviour varied with the type and amount of SCM such as the phenomenon was amplified with metakaolin, reduced by SF, unchanged with FA and showed irregular behaviour with RHA. Furthermore, new equations were proposed using multiple regression analysis (MRA) and design of experiments (DOE) to predict the Bingham parameters (yield stress and plastic viscosity) of cement slurries prepared in combination with or without supplementary cementitious materials considering various parameters including the ambient temperature, chemical admixture type and dosage, and superplasticizer type and dosage. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict the rheological properties of oil well cement slurries. The results indicated that the predicted rheological parameters for cement slurries were in good agreement with corresponding experimental results. However, the ANN-based model performed better than the MRA-based model or DOE-based model in predicting the rheological properties of OWC slurries...|$|R
