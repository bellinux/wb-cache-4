For surveillance purposes, this framework can easily be integrated into one of the standard sectoral files so that any update to <b>the</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> automatically feeds into the financial sector medium-term projections.

Fiscal reform can be a tool for peace when an unfair distribution of spending and taxation generates grievances that turn violent.

Edging toward the focus of this paper, changes of the institutional framework (e.g. CAP measures such as decoupling, quota, price floor; retail policy) have also been studied because of their effect on price transmission (Ferrucci et al., 2010; Bolotova and Novakocic, 2012; Cacchiarelli et al., 2016).|$|E
