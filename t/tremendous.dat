5|$|At House of Hardcore 32, Kenny and Mikey {{defeated}} Team <b>Tremendous.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely <b>tremendous.</b> He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a <b>tremendous</b> level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|The brand {{dropped from}} a net worth of A$18million in 2009 to A$9.7million in 2010. In June 2012 it was {{announced}} that the Nine Network, after their financial difficulties, had sold the Hi-5 brand to Asian equity group, Asiasons. The Malaysian-based company’s managing director Datuk Jared Lim revealed that they planned to expand the brand throughout South East Asia, but expressed that Hi-5's presence in Australia would remain intact. Former series producer Julie Greene took on the role as executive creative director and Lim became the brand's chairman. The Hi-5 brand was consolidated under new platform <b>Tremendous</b> Entertainment Group (TEG) in 2014, following Asiasons privatising and rebranding as <b>Tremendous</b> Asia Partners (TAP).|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} <b>tremendous</b> change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. <b>Tremendous</b> pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tremendous</b> {{pressure}} {{caused the}} formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|While the Olympic Games have {{experienced}} <b>tremendous</b> growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Paralympics {{have been unable}} to maintain a consistent international media presence.|$|E
5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached <b>tremendous</b> sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of <b>tremendous</b> public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made <b>tremendous</b> strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
5|$|Bates leaves Obydos; {{he finds}} the people lazy, as {{otherwise}} they could easily become comfortable with mixed farming. They sail through a <b>tremendous</b> storm. He finds a Pterochroza grasshopper whose forewings perfectly resemble leaves, the Victoria waterlily, masses of ticks, the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies. He meets Wallace again at Barra. Back in Para, he catches yellow fever.|$|E
5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence {{is that he has}} made a picture of <b>tremendous</b> and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E
5|$|He unsuccessfully contested Aberdeenshire at a {{by-election}} in 1786 {{with the}} support of the Duke of Gordon. George Skeneproposed by the Earl of Fife, who held <b>tremendous</b> sway in the political circles of that timedefeated him. The total electorate for Aberdeenshire was 190, and Ferguson was defeated by ten votes.|$|E
5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been <b>tremendous.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote {{a memoir}} {{entitled}} West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. The book has had <b>tremendous</b> critical acclaim {{and became an}} instant New York Times bestseller. During an interview on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, West revealed that as a child he {{was the victim of}} physical abuse from his father and has suffered from depression ever since.|$|E
5|$|In July 1910 {{racial tension}} flared towards the African-American {{community}} after a <b>tremendous</b> upset victory by African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting, {{as they did}} in cities across the U.S. The mobs wounded several black men in the city, killing one.|$|E
5|$|In Kōchi Prefecture, {{where the}} storm first made landfall, {{powerful}} wind gusts—measured up to —caused <b>tremendous</b> damage. Torrential rain accompanied the storm. Throughout Kōchi, 1,815homes were destroyed and 6,064 were damaged or flooded; 81people died and 399 more sustained injuries. Sixty-three {{people died in}} Muroto when the typhoon's storm surge swept away 550homes.|$|E
5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate {{the difficulty of the}} problems they faced. Their <b>tremendous</b> optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|Mobile is {{occasionally}} {{affected by}} major tropical storms and hurricanes. The city suffered a {{major natural disaster}} {{on the night of}} September 12, 1979, when category-3 Hurricane Frederic passed over the heart of the city. The storm caused <b>tremendous</b> damage to Mobile and the surrounding area. Mobile had moderate damage from Hurricane Opal on October 4, 1995, and Hurricane Ivan on September 16, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The attack led to {{engineering}} improvements allowing buildings to better withstand <b>tremendous</b> forces, improvements which {{were incorporated into}} the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.|$|E
5|$|The city saw <b>tremendous</b> {{industrial}} {{and population growth}} during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots. The city has experienced revitalization since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} experienced <b>tremendous</b> {{expansion in}} October 1984 {{with the addition}} of the 4073d US Army Reception Station, in Lafayette, Louisiana, with a strength of 809 personnel. The 402nd Brigade was also activated under the division's administrative control. It was designated to expand the training base for the Army's Field Artillery Training Center located at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In 1989 the division's location was returned to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a <b>tremendous</b> energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E
5|$|There was a <b>tremendous</b> {{public outcry}} when Ward {{was found not}} guilty. Newspapers across the nation {{condemned}} the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.|$|E
5|$|This <b>tremendous</b> growth {{translated}} {{directly into}} large {{profits for the}} textile corporations: between 1846 and 1850, for instance, the dividends of the Boston-based investors, the group of textile companies that founded Lowell, averaged 14 percent per year. Most corporations recorded similarly high profits during this period.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager. A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, {{he was able}} to head with the ball with <b>tremendous</b> power and accuracy. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Vava'u {{suffered}} a <b>tremendous</b> decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% {{from the previous}} year. Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% {{by the end of}} 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%. Owing to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Waka following its using.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{had both}} halfbacks {{close to the}} line and {{flanking}} the defensive tackles. That {{was the start of}} the double wingback offense, which enjoyed <b>tremendous</b> popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion. The double wing became the most effective of all systems for effective forward passing since it permitted the quick release of four receivers down the field.|$|E
5|$|After their modernization, both ships {{participated in}} the normal {{activities}} of the fleet, including fleet problem exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after {{the beginning of the}} Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor sank Arizona in a <b>tremendous</b> explosion and slightly damaged Pennsylvania, which was in dry dock at the time. Arizonas wreck was later partly salvaged and is now a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's <b>tremendous</b> presence worried some {{about the consequences of}} the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The <b>tremendous</b> success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E
5|$|Battered, Battleship Division Nine steamed {{into the}} {{anchorage}} of the Grand Fleet {{later that day}} to the <b>tremendous</b> cheering of {{the men on the}} assembled British warships. Wasting no time, Admiral Rodman called upon the commander of the Grand Fleet—Admiral Sir David Beatty—to offer the services of himself, his men, and his ships to the Allied cause. With Beatty's acceptance, the American battleships, while retaining their American designation of Battleship Division Nine, officially became the Sixth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a <b>tremendous</b> boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed below) and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw <b>tremendous</b> economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Edge rescues Gash, {{one of a}} band of {{scavengers}} {{called the}} Seekers, from a monster. Gash directs him to a nearby nomadic caravan, where he learns {{the location of the}} Black Fleet. With the dragon, Edge defeats the fleet, but learns that Craymen has already reached the Tower, an ancient structure of <b>tremendous</b> power. He fends off an attack by the girl from the excavation site, who has sworn allegiance to Craymen and rides an enormous dragon, Atolm.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>tremendous</b> {{success of}} 2008's Iron Man, Downey agreed to reprise {{his role as}} Tony Stark in two more Iron Man films {{as well as the}} superhero team put {{together}} by S.H.I.E.L.D., The Avengers. After appearing in a connecting cameo scene {{at the end of the}} 2008 version of The Incredible Hulk, Downey returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, opened in May 2010. It grossed over $623M worldwide, becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with <b>tremendous</b> vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E
