5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
25|$|The {{images in}} Haskins Posters traversed {{different}} creative themes that all became signature passions for Haskins' image-making {{over the next}} three decades; graphically strong compositions of nudes characterised by a natural essence in the models while the image-making explored themes of graphic experimentation, humour and sensual eroticism. Haskins has a recurring theme (rooted in his training as a painter) of creating tension in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> photographs between flat graphic elements and 3D chiaroscuro. These results are often achieved with sophisticated lighting and/or double exposures. A highly creative and design driven approach to lighting almost always {{plays a key role in}} Haskins' work, both in the studio and on location. He often develops complex lighting designs for a single specific shot that are never repeated, the most recent example being a fashion shoot for New York magazine's 75th anniversary issue shot in New York's Pier 57 studios in August 2006.|$|E
500|$|Alan Tudyk as Hoban [...] "Wash" [...] Washburne– Serenity {{pilot and}} Zoe's husband. Deeply {{in love with}} his wife, Wash expresses jealousy over his wife's [...] "war buddy" [...] {{relationship}} and unconditional support of their captain, most particularly in the episode [...] "War Stories", in which he confronts Mal, even as they are being tortured by a dissatisfied customer. He joined pilot training just to see the stars, which were invisible from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> polluted homeworld, and he joined Serenity despite being highly sought after by other ships. He is very light-hearted and tends to make amusing comments, despite the severity of any situation.|$|E
50|$|His {{work was}} {{generally}} less accomplished and his portraits more stiffly articulated {{than that of}} similar painters such as Daniel Mijtens. However, <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings are decorative and {{the background of the}} Portrait of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury contains an historically important view of Hatfield House with sportsmen in the foreground.|$|R
50|$|Krut’s {{technique}} is to construct <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> canvases {{with layers of}} colourful paint. There is a strong relationship {{to the structure of}} drawing and use of flattened pictorial space. Each canvas carries a particular and spirited character: fans, vortexes, geometric angles, dynamic and judiciously suggestive organic shapes recur throughout his compositions, revealing an abstracted, abject portraiture.|$|R
5000|$|Schoeler's work {{is often}} {{concerned}} {{with the ideas of}} fragility, beauty, vulnerability, as well as representations of youth and masculinity."Seen up close, the rich rendering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> models' skin is second only to <b>the</b> rich <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings themselves. It’s hard not to get lost in what he describes as the boundary between what is on the inside and what is on the outside." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fontana often {{lined the}} reverse of his canvases with black gauze so that the {{darkness}} would shimmer behind the open cuts and create a mysterious sense of illusion and depth. He then created an elaborate neon ceiling called [...] "Luce spaziale" [...] in 1951 for the Triennale in Milan. In his important series of Concetto spaziale, La Fine di Dio (1963–64), Fontana uses the egg shape. With his Pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, Fontana fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. In his Buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949-50, he punctured <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. From 1958 he purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewer’s attention on the slices that rend {{the skin of the}} canvas. In 1959 Fontana exhibited cut-off paintings with multiple combinable elements (he named the sets quanta), and began Nature, a series of sculptures made by cutting a gash across a sphere of terracotta clay, which he subsequently cast in bronze.|$|E
2500|$|The {{furnaces}} at Cornwall Furnace {{went through}} {{two stages of}} technology. Peter Grubb was born in Delaware about 1702 and settled {{in what is now}} Lebanon County in 1734. [...] He bought about [...] of magnetite rich land. Grubb also noticed that his land had the other natural resources needed to produce iron. Namely, vast stands of timber for the production of charcoal, running water to operate the bellows, and an ample supply of limestone needed to add flux to the smelting furnaces. Grubb's plans were further helped {{by the fact that the}} magnetite at Cornwall was either very close to or on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> land. He was ready to venture into the iron business and set about the task of building an iron [...] "plantation". These centers of iron production were usually located well away from the heavily cleared farmlands and were nestled in the Ridge and Valley section of Pennsylvania. Grubb constructed his furnaces, first a bloomery and later the more modern charcoal-fired blast furnace and the support buildings and mill village that was needed to house his workers. [...] He named his operation Cornwall because his father, John Grubb had come from Cornwall, UK in 1677. [...] Cornwall Iron Furnace was an excellent fit for the agricultural based economy of the Thirteen Colonies. Iron was needed to make into tools, nails and weapons. The official policy of Great Britain frowned on manufacturing in the colonies, but England was no longer able to produce the needed iron for its needs let alone the needs of the colonists. In fact England had become dependent on importing iron from Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|Coper would {{characteristically}} {{throw his}} work on the potter's wheel, then alter and assemble pieces by hand to achieve the finished form. Thus, although made on the wheel, his work has a sculptural quality, but is always functional. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pots tend to be roughly textured and coloured with oxides, especially manganese oxide. His distinctive pots take on recognizable [...] "forms" [...] he termed Spade, Bud, Cup, Egg, Flower and Arrow.|$|R
60|$|Father Benwell {{listened to}} this rhapsody--so {{characteristic}} of the childish simplicity of the man--with an inward sense of impatience, which never once showed itself on <b>the</b> smiling <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
50|$|In his {{exhibitions}} Jongeleen {{brings the}} street {{within the walls}} of the White Cube. His works are made of discarded hardboard on which short critical quotes are sprayed. Jongeleen finds these texts on websites such as Geen Stijl, Spitsnieuws and Retecool, which publicize sharp opinionated pieces focused on news, actual events and politics. On these websites Jongeleen selects opinions on contemporary art, spraying these quotes onto <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artworks. By this Jongeleen tries {{to call attention to the}} public ideas on art.|$|R

60|$|I {{could not}} quite make out whether the banker was serious or not in all this talk; {{sometimes}} I suspected him of a fine mockery, but the Altrurian took him upon <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> words.|$|E
60|$|There {{stood the}} Doctor, quite still, with his large yellow eye fixed on Mr. Mackaw. At length he {{perceived}} the cold pasty, {{and his little}} black wings began to flutter on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> immense body.|$|E
50|$|Stingel {{was born}} in Merano, Italy. His work engages the {{audience}} in dialogue about their perception of art and uses Conceptual painting and installations to explore the process of creation. Using readily available materials such as styrofoam, carpet, and cast polyurethane, Stingel creates art based upon an underlying conceptual framework and challenges contemporary notions about painting. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> two-dimensional works are characteristically carved out, imprinted or indented, visibly evidencing the artist’s alteration of industrial matter. He lives in New York and Merano, Italy.|$|R

50|$|Smith's work {{includes}} {{a combination of}} jewelry (rings, bracelets, pendants) and functional objects such as teapots, goblets, flasks, urns and keepsake boxes. He designs, forms and fabricates each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works by hand. The patterns <b>of</b> ornamentation in <b>his</b> works are frequently cut from silver sheet and soldered or annealed to base plate. <b>The</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works often feature applied patinas or hammered textures. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works are adorned with semi-precious or precious stones, bone, horn, and even ancient mastodon tusk from glacier-finds in Alaska and Siberia.|$|R
6000|$|He {{abandoned}} {{himself to}} a fancy which had been working to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thought. [...] "We could call it our Silver Wedding Journey, and go round to all the old places, and {{see them in the}} reflected light of the past." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{characters}} {{could hardly}} be wider apart, than the size and development of man's brain, {{and the distribution of}} hair upon <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body; yet they both lead us to the same conclusion--that some other power than Natural Selection has been engaged in his production.|$|E
60|$|He shuddered lightly now and again, as {{they stepped}} lurching down the hill. He set his jaws hard to {{suppress}} this shuddering. It {{was not in}} his limbs, or even on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, for Helena did not notice it. Yet he shuddered almost in anguish internally.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s Taylor's work in glass turned to classic vessel forms based on ancient Greek kraters, lekythoi and amphoras. At first <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> these bulging forms displayed colorful spots and splotches that contrasted with the solid body color of the vessels; but a trip to the desert regions of Idaho and Oregon influenced Taylor to wrap <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vessels in landscape-like configurations of color. In 1980 Taylor returned briefly to ceramic, folding and draping slabs of porcelain into twisting, gestural forms. These he airbrushed in black and brown glazes to emphasize the forms' depth.|$|R

5000|$|When more {{traditional}} {{materials such as}} gold or silver are used, they are often worked in ways that produce non-traditional textures. For example, English jeweler Gerda Flockinger would melt down <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> her pieces to create unusual textures typically not seen in traditional jewellery. A 1999 article in Modern Silver magazine described how Patricia Tormey [...] "slammed molten gold between layers of textured charcoal and dropped it into a tray of lentils." [...] Michael Becker was known to file or score <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brooches to emphasize his architectural references. Overall, the objective was to produce innovative and abstract textures that reminded the viewer of industrial processes and architecture.|$|R
60|$|Sigsbee's benevolence was {{expanding}} {{under the}} influence of the Scotch highball and his cigar.

6000|$|... 'Six years old!' said Mr Dombey, {{settling}} his neckcloth--perhaps to hide an irrepressible {{smile that}} rather seemed to strike upon <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face and glance away, as finding no resting-place, than to play there for an instant. 'Dear me, six {{will be changed}} to sixteen, before {{we have time to}} look about us.' ...|$|E
25|$|Laver's 200 singles {{titles are}} the most in tennis history. This {{included}} his all-time men's record of 10 or more titles per year for seven consecutive years (1964–70).

60|$|He made {{no sign of}} greeting; {{neither did}} Mr Verloc, who {{certainly}} knew his place; but a subtle change about the general outlines <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of Mr Verloc’s spine under <b>the</b> vast <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat. <b>The</b> effect was of unobtrusive deference.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004 Chilean Christian Democrat Ignacio Walker wrote {{a column}} in El Mercurio criticizing Peronism stating it had [...] "Fascistoid", [...] "authoritarian" [...] and [...] "corporative" [...] traits. He added that [...] "I tend to think the real wall that separes Chile from Argentina is not the Andes but the [...] legacy of Peronism and its perverse logic". A few months after Walker had written this column he was {{appointed}} chancellor and <b>the</b> <b>surfacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous statements caused a diplomatic impasse between Chile and Peronist-ruled Argentina.

5000|$|In 1995 Green {{started to}} paint again, taking up {{where he left}} off many years before.

5000|$|Talberg's oeuvre {{deals with}} {{antagonistic}} positions such as Nature & Alchemy, Asymmetry & Dynamics or Eros & Thanathos. Since 1990 he {{is associated with}} the style of [...] "Anti-Capitalist Abstraction" [...] which he founded, and ever since 1994 with [...] "Young Jewish Art" [...] respectively. During the last decade he has intensified his interest for Jewish mysticism and magic. On extensive journeys he creates new serials of photography that in turn shape the base for new artwork cycles. Likewise <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artworks contain references to aramaic letters, Voodoo, Egyptian symbols, Chinese economic numbers. Talberg is known for his PINTURA ALCHEMICA (Volte-face paintings) in which he inverts the canvasses according to the ancient alchemic principle of [...] "conversio oppositorum".|$|R
