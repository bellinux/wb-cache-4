The development of the hyperbolic functions, in addition to those of the <b>trigonometric</b> (<b>circular)</b> <b>functions,</b> appears in parallel columns for comparison.

This paper explores some of the potential for such technologies to affect the curriculum and teaching of trigonometry in the secondary school. We identify some {{of the ways in which}} the teaching of trigonometry might be supported by the availability of various forms of technology. We consider circular measures, graphs of functions, trigonometric identities, equations and statistical modeling and focus on activities that are not possible without the use of technology. Modern technology provides an excellent means of exploring many of the concepts associated with trigonometry, both <b>trigonometric</b> and <b>circular</b> <b>functions.</b> Many of these opportunities for learning were not available before technology development and access within schools we enjoy today.

It consists of the harmonic balance with linearization in which Jacobian elliptic functions are used instead of <b>circular</b> <b>trigonometric</b> <b>functions.</b> We show that a simple change of independent variable followed by a careful choice of the form of anhar-monic solution enable to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions. In particular our examples show that the proposed method is as easy to use as existing harmonic balance based methods and yet provides substantially greater accuracy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{argument}} of the <b>circular</b> <b>trigonometric</b> <b>functions</b> is usually expressed as an angle like theta in Figure 1. An angle (in radians) is defined on {{a circle and}} {{is equal to the}} subtended arc length [...] divided by the radius of the circle. Therefore, on the unit circle, an angle and its subtended arc length are numerically equal. But notice that the circumference of the unit circle is [...] and the area is [...] Therefore, an angle on a unit circle is numerically equal to twice the area of the sector subtended by that angle (the red area in Figure 1).

40|$|In {{this paper}} non-cylindrical flow {{variation}} in swan neck ducts with prescribed flow characteristics will be investigated. The flow will {{be characterized by}} the total head, H(ψ) a function of only the stream function, ψ (x, r) and {{a function of the}} circumferential velocity u where the subscript represents the circumferential component of the velocity vector u in cylindrical coordinates (x, r,). The cylindrical flow variation is shown to be dependent on the zeros of the Bessel Cross product of order one. It is further shown for a class of swirling flows denoted in this paper as the Stokes-Poisson class that it is theoretically possible for cylindrical flow to be present for any inlet radius r 1, with the different cylindrical flows given either by <b>circular</b> <b>trigonometric</b> <b>functions</b> or hyperbolic functions and being dependent only on the sign of the separation constant that arises naturally in this analysis...|$|R
40|$|The Geometry of Special Relativity {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} special relativity that encourages readers to see beyond the formulas to the deeper geometric structure. The text treats the geometry of hyperbolas {{as the key to}} understanding special relativity. This approach replaces the ubiquitous I symbol of most standard treatments with the appropriate hyperbolic trigonometric functions. In most cases, this not only simplifies the appearance of the formulas, but also emphasizes their geometric content {{in such a way as}} to make them almost obvious. Furthermore, many important relations, including the famous relativistic addition formula for velocities, follow directly from the appropriate trigonometric addition formulas. The book first describes the basic physics of special relativity to set the stage for the geometric treatment that follows. It then reviews properties of ordinary two-dimensional Euclidean space, expressed in terms of the usual <b>circular</b> <b>trigonometric</b> <b>functions,</b> before presenting a similar treatment of two-dimensional Minkowski space, expressed in terms of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. After covering special relativity again from the geometric point of view, the text discusses standard paradoxes, applications to relativistic mechanics, the relativistic unification of electricity and magnetism, and further steps leading to Einstein's general theory of relativity. The book also briefly describes the further steps leading to Einstein's general theory of relativity and then explores applications of hyperbola geometry to non-Euclidean geometry and calculus, including a geometric construction of the derivatives of trigonometric functions and the exponential function...|$|R
