5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} to recalculate <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{argue that}} <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{authenticity}} {{does not explain}} <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. There are a plurality of species of authenticity; {{in this paper we}} consider four species: avoiding pretense (§ 2), Frankfurtian wholeheartedness (§ 3), existential self-knowledge (§ 4), and spontaneity (§ 4). Our thesis is that, for each <b>of</b> these species, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity does not (partially) explain <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. Moreover, when it comes to spontaneity, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity conflicts with <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. A contemporary slogan, a favorite of self-help gurus, enjoins you to “be yourself,” implying <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. <b>The</b> Delphic motto, a favorite of philosophers, enjoins you to “know thyself, ” implying <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. What is the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge? Can <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> one explain <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other? “Authenticity ” is ambiguous in a variety of ways: representations are said to be authentic when they are accurate, cuisines are said to be authentic when they resemble some paradigm, and people are said to be authentic when they are “true to themselves. ” It is this personal sense of “authentic ” with which we are concerned here.
