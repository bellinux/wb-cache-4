German Wirehaired pointers are happiest and most well behaved when {{they are part of}} the family and can spend time with their people. They can be rather willful. Some dogs have a tendency to roam. Powerful and energetic, they can become bored and hard to manage without enough exercise. The German Wirehaired pointer is a good all-around gun dog, able to hunt any sort of game on any sort of terrain. This dog has a good nose and can track, point, and retrieve on both land and water. Loyal and playful, the German Wirehaired Pointer thrives on human companionship. These dogs should have the correct temperament to live with children of all ages. Although they are generally accepting of other dogs, they tend to focus upon the people in their family.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} who hears what secrets, comparing two similar secrets — {{one which is}} highly stigmatized and one which is less so. Using a unique survey representative of American adults and intake forms from a medical clinic, I document marked differences in who hears these secrets. People who are sympathetic to the stigmatizing secret {{are more likely to}} hear of it than those who may react negatively. This is a consequence not just of people selectively disclosing their own secrets but selectively sharing others’ as well. As a result, people in the same social network will be exposed to and influenced by different information about <b>those</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> and hence experience that network differently. When people effectively exist in networks tailored by others to not offend then the information they hear tends to be that of which they already approve. Were they to hear secrets they disapprove of then their attitudes might change but {{they are less likely to}} hear those secrets. As such, the patterns of secret-hearing contribute to a stasis in public opinion...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{perspective}} of young people placed in a 24 -Hour Care Centre. The study is based on three young people’s description of their experiences of a specific care centre, which is collected by lifeworld interviews. The thesis {{is based on the}} research question: How do the young people who were interviewed articulate themselves and the particular 24 -hour Care Centre which they are a part of, and how do they position themselves in proportion to the Care Centre and other individuals in the society? On the basis of the above-mentioned research question, we studied and used Erving Goffman’s theory about stigma, Bronwyn Davies and Rom Harré’s positioning theory and Kenneth J. Gergen’s theory about social constructions. Our thesis is based on the scientific theoretical perspective of social constructionism. The thesis analysis paragraph is showing, that the young people in the care centre are articulating themselves differently: for instance our research shows,that one of the young participants describes herself as not to pass and that she is being candid about her conceivable stigma, while the other two young participants wish to pass and hide it. We further analyzed how the young participants are defining their in-group and out-group, and furthermore our analysis is showing, how the young people are positioned differently: one of the young people is adopting a position, which demands a need for adult support, whereas the other young people position themselves as independent. Further to this, is it possible to see how the young people understand their possible diagnosis and how they construct themselves being ill or not being ill. The reaction towards the society is also different for the three young people. Two of them keep a distance from their previous friends and do not have any or minimal contact with their family, which can indicate, that they are keeping a distance from <b>those</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> and from the possible stigma they can cause. The other young participant has daily contact with her family and often visits them in the weekends. She is candid about her diagnosis and describes how her relations pity her. Our conclusion is showing, how the three young people separate from one another, but retain the positive fact, that they have all received help and support from the care centre...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{nurses and}} {{midwives}} care for people they know; friends, family, acquaintances, colleagues, their children’s teachers. Often {{this situation is}} not by choice but rather by necessity as dictated by staffing numbers or skill mix, or frequently both. Rarely do they bemoan such a situation; rather, they {{get on with the}} job regardless of how confronting they might find the situation. This study aimed to examine and develop an understanding of the phenomenon of rural nurses and midwives caring for those they knew. Heideggerian phenomenology was chosen to frame this research. Given that the researcher has considerable experiences with the phenomenon in question, this approach is befitting because Heidegger espoused the researchers pre-conceived experiences and beliefs as integral to interpreting the data. Data were generated with eight participants, who shared the stories of their experiences of caring for someone they knew. The researcher then devised an individually tailored approach to thematically analyze the data. Three substantive themes emerged from the study that provide an empathic interpretation of {{what it is like to}} be a rural nurse or midwife caring for someone with whom a dual or multiple relationship is shared. Namely these themes are: Knowing before, knowing more, Doing a bit extra and Holding it together. This study indicates that rural clinicians readily, Do a bit extra for <b>those</b> <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> This finding is attributed largely to the Australian cultural appreciation of ‘mateship’; knowing that they are highly likely to re-encounter their patients rural practitioners want to know they have done their best and additionally that they will be seen in a positive light for having given their best. A particular struggle for rural practitioners is illustrated by the theme, Knowing before, knowing more. Small communities are by definition close knit, with highly functional grapevines as a primary means of communication. Whilst the nurses cherished the privileged position they held, they nevertheless often felt burdened by knowing more about patients, their illnesses or their situations than the person did, or even before the person. Holding it together, describes the requirement to continue to perform clinically despite the personal cost to the rural nurse or midwife. Thus as a coping strategy many employed an alter ego, or a stronger part of themselves called the ‘nurse’ or the ‘midwife’ to absolve their personal self of traumatic events. Despite the many potential difficulties associated with caring for those they knew, rural nurses and midwives unanimously embrace the opportunity, considering the situation a privilege. Overall these findings add to the body of knowledge about rural nursing and midwifery practice and the unique challenges faced by rural practitioners in their daily work. While the findings specifically relate to nurses and midwives, many of the themes may transfer across the many health disciplines of rural health care. These findings therefore, have implications for educationalists and curriculum development to ensure that due credence is paid to the issues common in rural nursing and midwifery and by offering these insights, curricula can better prepare students of nursing and midwifery for their future working lives. Additionally, the outcomes would be a useful inclusion in industry orientation programs, especially those aimed at clinicians unfamiliar with the idiosyncrasies of rural practice...|$|E

Comas saw anthropology (all of its subfields) as “the solution {{of the social and}} economic problems of the different countries” (1950:567). However, he knew that the governmental structures present usually do not allow the implementation of these solutions, and when they did, they were not done under the guidance, according to Comas, of well-trained anthropologists. He saw anthropology as a way to perform social activism — a way to ameliorate the situation in which much of the rural citizenry were living. His work showed that even within Mexico things like medicine availability could improve with the work of anthropologists. He called for anthropologist to make the situation better to <b>those</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> were suffering.|$|R
