40|$|This study {{investigates the}} housing {{characteristics}} and {{the determinants of}} housing production of the informal housing sector in Alexandria, Egypt. It also examines the impact of land policies {{on the development of}} the informal housing sector. Informal housing, by definition, is constructed and acquired outside the legal procedure of land and building registration and without the necessary permissions and approvals. Therefore, there is a little knowledge about it, and its role in the housing market could be underestimated. The aim of this research is to enhance the factual knowledge about informal housing as a basis for future policy development. The findings of this research, based on data collected from a field study conducted in four informal settlements in Alexandria in 1991, include the following: 1. Macro-economic, political, and social structures accelerated the emergence and the development of informal housing settlements, which occurred rapidly during and after times of economic and political crises. 2. Informal settlements are heterogeneous and it is not evident that informal housing is synonymous with marginal housing for poor people. 3. Informal settlements have low levels of public utilities and infrastructure. 4. Income, <b>household</b> size, age <b>of</b> <b>household</b> head, and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>household</b> are the major variables that explain different patterns of housing consumption and expenditure among informal <b>households.</b> 5. Inhabitants <b>of</b> informal settlements have moved from other areas of the city rather than origins outside Alexandria. Owners are more satisfied with both the units and the neighborhoods than renters are. 6. The determinants of informal housing production are in a dynamic process of change and are self-organized. The general conditions of the overall housing market influence informal housing in similar ways. Informal housing finance depends upon small scale and incremental methods of savings. 7. Implementation of different land policies results in augmenting provision of illegal land subdivisions, increasing land prices and expanding informal land market operation. From the analysis undertaken in this research and previous findings, some policy implications for future planning for informal development become evident...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{determine}} whether or not relationships exist among belief systems and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> junior high school teachers in a metropolitan school system, and their attitudes toward educational innovation. On the basis of previous theory and research it was anticipated that closed and open personalities should differ in their receptivity toward educational innovation. It was also assumed that tenured and non-tenured teachers should differ in receptivity toward educational innovation. Specifically, the thesis was designed to investigate this question: Do dogmatism and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> junior high school teachers influence their attitudes towards educational innovation? The following three statistical null hypotheses were developed to investigate the above question: (1) There are no statistically significant differences on resistance to educational innovation scores between open-minded teachers and closed-minded teachers. (2) There are no statistically significant <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> differences related to resistance to educational innovation scores. (3) There is no statistically significant interaction effect between <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> and dogmatism when the criterion is resistance to educational innovation. The sample for the study consists of 302 junior high school teachers in a large eastern metropolitan school system in the United States. The measuring instruments include the Educational Innovation Attitude Scale, the twenty-item Dogmatism Scale, and a Personal Data Form. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance techniques. Conclusions drawn from the data reveal that there were significant positive relationships between <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> and resistance to educational innovation, and between closed-mindedness and resistance to educational innovation. It is also revealed that dogmatism-tenure status interactions were not significant on the resistance to educational innovation measure. The findings tend to support the independent nature <b>of</b> dogmatism and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> as significant predictors of resistance toward educational innovation. Furthermore, this study shows that <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> and Rokeach's theory of dogmatism can be empirically defined and their effects on innovative behavior investigated. As a result of this study, the following are suggestions for further research: (1) That replicative studies with samples of teachers other than junior high school teachers be chosen from different school systems; (2) That further investigations <b>of</b> dogmatism and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> dimensions in relation to operative innovations be conducted; (3) That further examinations of the interaction of personality factors and environmental conditions in relation to innovativeness be made...|$|R

This paper aimed to examine women's autonomy and its associated factors in the Kapilvastu district of Nepal. We measured women's autonomy using a recently developed women's autonomy measurement scale from June to October 2014. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test and logistic multivariate modeling technique were applied for assessing the association of demographic and socio-economic characteristics of women and their autonomy. Mean score for women's autonomy was 23. 34 ± 8. 06 out of the possible maximum 48. It was found to be positively associated with higher age difference at marriage, advantaged caste/ethnicity, better employment for the husband, couple's education more than 10 years schooling, and higher economic <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the <b>household.</b> We found strong direct effect of women's education (OR = 8. 14, CI = 3. 77 - 17. 57), husband's education (OR = 2. 63, CI = 1. 69 - 4. 10) and economic <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> (OR = 1. 42, CI = 1. 01 - 2. 03) on women's autonomy. When we adjusted women's education for husband's education, the odds ratio decreased by around 22 % {from (OR = 8. 14, CI = 3. 77 - 17. 57) to (OR = 6. 32, CI = 2. 77 - 14. 46) } and was a mediator effect.

The research methodology was undertaken in two stages; firstly, a literature review was undertaken in order to provide a theoretical perspective on household food security. Secondly, an empirical study comprising <b>of</b> a <b>household</b> survey was undertaken. The household survey was conducted among 225 participants of Kwakwatsi Township in the Free State province (South Africa). Data was collected using a self-administrated-questionnaire. The attainment <b>of</b> <b>household</b> food security is a major concern facing the world at large, including South Africa. South Africa is classified as a middle income country with large inequalities and absolute poverty. Although South Africa is nationally self-sufficient in food supply, many households are vulnerable to food insecurity. Natural disasters, population growth, low agricultural development, food prices, income inequalities, poverty and health issues are the main causes <b>of</b> <b>household</b> food insecurity in the world. The method of data analysis was two-fold: firstly, the Household Food Insecurity Access scale (HFIAS) developed by the USAID was used to determine the food security <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> in Kwakwatsi. Secondly, a legit regression model was used to estimate the socio-economic and demographic variables that determine the food security <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>households.</b> According to the HFIAS classification measure, approximately 51. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>households</b> were categorised as food secure, 8. 9 % as mildly food insecure and 10. 7 % as moderately food insecure and 29. 3 % as severely food insecure. Food insecurity was mostly associated with female-headed households than male-headed <b>households.</b> The results <b>of</b> the regression analysis suggest that gender, household size, marital status and household income influence household food security. The probability of food security decreases if household is headed by a female. Larger household sizes experience less food security because they consume more food with fewer resources. Households headed by people who are not married have a higher chance of being food secure than those of married couples, this is because married couples have larger household sizes compared to unmarried household heads.

40|$|Using Italian data on Income {{and living}} {{conditions}} for the year 2005, the paper investigates the main determinants of households’ subjective economic well-being {{by means of a}} Partial Proportional Ordered Logit Model. According to a joint subjective and objective perspective of analysis, we use as dependent variable the perceived ability <b>of</b> <b>households</b> to make ends meet. Whereas, we use as explanatory variables some objective aspects of living conditions relating to housing, financial equilibrium, possession of durables and quality of residence place and some socio-demographic characteristics. The empirical results show that the financial strain is the most relevant dimension of living conditions influencing the subjective economic well-being, but its effect is attenuated depending on the level of education and the <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> accommodation.

We also examined the effects of socio-economic factors on the WTP. Methods: The contingent valuation method, an economic survey technique, was used. We used the iterative bidding game technique to elicit household WTP that involved a sequence of dichotomous choice questions followed by a final open-ended question. A total <b>of</b> 370 <b>households</b> that did not have toilets were selected for this study. Respondents to the questionnaire were the primary income earners and decision-makers <b>of</b> their respective <b>household.</b> Results: <b>Of</b> those responding to the questionnaire, 62. 1 % reported being willing to pay for the construction of bathrooms with a flush toilet. The mean and median of maximum WTP amounts were Viet Nam Dong (VND) 15. 6 million and VND 13. 0 million, respectively (minimum VND 2. 0 million; maximum VND 45. 0 million).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} quantitative {{evidence of}} a gender division of labor within the <b>households</b> <b>of</b> four peasant classes living in two villages in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The gender division of labor results in a disproportionate share <b>of</b> total <b>household</b> work being performed by women. Further, the paper demonstrates that an improvement in the economic <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> leads to increased work demands being placed upon women. The gender division of labor is an explicit function of the dominant ideology of the area. However, such dominance does not go uncontested.

40|$|Housing {{aspiration}} is {{an important}} aspect of housing market analysis. However, there is a paucity of empirical research on housing aspiration among residents in informal settlements in developing countries. This study therefore investigated housing aspiration among the residents of Ayobo, Lagos, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey <b>of</b> 1, 151 <b>households</b> in Ayobo was conducted using a structured questionnaire as the data-collection instrument. The data were analysed using descriptive statistical and categorical regression analyses. The results show {{that a majority of the}} respondents were low-income earners living in rented and rooming-house types of accommodation. Around 73 % of them expressed an intention to move to another residence, and 56 % of this category of respondents intend to move into self-contained flats. The reasons for the planned relocation include poor condition of their present dwellings, changes in <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> and household size, and the desire for exclusive use of facilities in their homes. In addition to these reasons, the waste-disposal method, sharing facilities, employment, and age and marital <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the residents emerged as the strongest predictors of housing aspiration among the respondents in the survey. This implies that, in order to meet the housing preferences and aspirations of residents in informal urban settlements in Nigeria, housing developers need to give adequate attention to the marital, age, employment and <b>tenure</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the residents and place emphasis on developing affordable single-family houses and block of flats, as well as strategies for improving access to basic social amenities and services...|$|R
