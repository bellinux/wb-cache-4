The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other <b>toppings</b> compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
40|$|Timber floors with {{insufficient}} {{strength and}} stiffness can be upgraded by applying a concrete <b>topping</b> {{to form a}} composite structure. Conventional upgrades have a <b>topping</b> thickness of 40 mm or greater but recent research has proposed an alternative thin <b>topping</b> solution (20 mm). The shear connectors which transfer the forces between the timber joists and concrete <b>topping</b> are {{critical to the success}} of the upgrade. This paper presents the results of pushout testing of thin <b>topping</b> timber-concrete composite joints. A factorial experimental design was employed to assess how the inclination, <b>topping</b> thickness and timber density affect the stiffness and strength of screw joints. The results were statistically assessed to differentiate between the effects of each factor and establish the presence of interactions between factors. The screw inclination and <b>topping</b> thickness were found to be important factors when considering the stiffness of the joints. Topping thickness was the most critical factor for the strength of the joints...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{plant has}} many {{responses}} to <b>topping,</b> {{such as the}} increase in ability of nicotine synthesis and secondary growth of roots. Some <b>topping</b> responsive miRNAs and genes had been identified in our previous work, {{but it is not}} enough to elaborate mechanism of tobacco response to <b>topping.</b> Here, <b>topping</b> responsive proteins were screened from tobacco roots with two-dimensional electrophoresis. Of these proteins, calretulin (CRT) and Auxin-responsive protein IAA 9 were related to the secondary growth of roots, LRR disease resistance, heat shock protein 70 and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 （FPPS）were involved in wounding stress response, and F-box protein played an important role in promoting the ability of nicotine synthesis after <b>topping.</b> In addition, there were five tobacco bHLH proteins (NtbHLH, NtMYC 1 a, NtMYC 1 b, NtMYC 2 a and NtMYC 2 b) related to nicotine synthesis. It was suggested that NtMYC 2 might be the main positive transcription factor and NtbHLH protein is a negative regulator in the JA-mediating activation of nicotine synthesis after <b>topping.</b> Tobacco <b>topping</b> activates some comprehensive biology processes involving IAA and JA signaling pathway, and the identification of these proteins will be helpful to understand the process of <b>topping</b> response...|$|R

5|$|One of its {{international}} failures was the BK Crown Jewels line of sandwiches, originally sold in New Zealand. These larger, adult-oriented sandwiches {{were made with}} fried and grilled chicken or a Whopper patty {{and a variety of}} <b>toppings</b> and served on a Kaiser roll. <b>Toppings</b> included a mango lime sauce, avocado, aioli, a Cajun spiced sauce, and relish. Originally successful, the sandwiches piqued the interest of Burger King's corporate offices and were being considered for a potential global rollout. However, interest in the product faded and they were discontinued.|$|E
50|$|While under sail, the {{opposite}} {{force to the}} vang is supplied by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a <b>topping</b> lift supplies the upward force on the boom. Some line vang systems incorporate a piston to provide the <b>topping</b> lift force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the <b>topping</b> lift role.|$|R
40|$|The {{most likely}} use of {{thermionic}} conversion {{is in the}} form of a <b>topping</b> cycle combined with a steam-turbogenerator plant. A specific reference system is chosen in which the thermionic <b>topping</b> cycle occurs in thermionic heat exchangers referred to as large, modular thermionic units to which heat is transferred from a separate heat source and which reject their heat to a conventional steam turboelectric system. Results of analysis show that the performance and cost criteria for practical thermionic <b>topping</b> of large electric power plants are well within the reach of demonstrated and foreseeable converter capabilities. Thermionic <b>topping</b> has many significant advantages over unconventional cycles proposed for <b>topping</b> applications, including level of demonstrated and projected performance and lifetime, development time, and design simplicity...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation was}} made of a <b>topping</b> cycle aircraft engine system which uses a cryogenic fuel. This system consists of a main turboshaft engine which is mechanically coupled (by cross-shafting) to a <b>topping</b> loop which augments the shaft power output of the system. The thermodynamic performance of the <b>topping</b> cycle engine was analyzed and {{compared with that of}} a reference (conventional-type) turboshaft engine. For the cycle operating conditions selected, the performance of the <b>topping</b> cycle engine in terms of brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was determined to be about 12 percent better than that of the reference turboshaft engine. Engine weights were estimated for both the <b>topping</b> cycle engine and the reference turboshaft engine. These estimates were based on a common shaft power output for each engine. Results indicate that the weight of the <b>topping</b> cycle engine is comparable to that of the reference turboshaft engine. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 3494...|$|R

40|$|COTTON 2 K, {{like most}} other cotton {{production}} models, does not always adequately represent local growth conditions owing {{to the fact that}} it fails to take into account some indigenous cultivation practices. For instance, pruning and <b>topping,</b> a common practice for cotton cultivation in China is not included in the model simulation of COTTON 2 K. The objective of this research therefore was to: (1) modify COTTON 2 K source code and slot pruning and <b>topping</b> simulation switch on to the model, and (2) calibrate and validate the modified COTTON 2 K model with field data from pruning and <b>topping</b> cultivation practice. First, field collected data in 2003 and 2004 were compared between the treatments, with and without pruning and <b>topping,</b> and the COTTON 2 K source code updated with the 'pruning and topping' switch. This was followed by the calibration and validation of the updated model with field data and simulation of the effect of pruning and <b>topping</b> on cotton performance. It was noted from field observations that pruning and <b>topping</b> reduced total fruit sites, but at the same time, increased retained boll number, possibly due to significant reductions in abscised fruit sites. Though total dry matter production dropped, more dry matter allocation to reproductive organs, however, enhanced higher cotton lint yield in the pruning and <b>topping</b> treatment. Results of the modified model simulation showed that growth in the number of main-stem node ceased after <b>topping.</b> Furthermore, there was more biomass allocation to reproductive organs, such as green and open bolls under pruning and <b>topping.</b> Coefficient of determination above 0. 8 for most of the growth factors was obtained in the calibration and validation processes under pruning and <b>topping,</b> a strong indication of the level of success of the model modification. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{performance}} benefits {{derived by}} <b>topping</b> a {{gas turbine engine}} with a wave engine are assessed. The wave engine is a wave rotor that produces shaft power by exploiting gas dynamic energy exchange and flow turning. The wave engine {{is added to the}} baseline turboshaft engine while keeping high-pressure-turbine inlet conditions, compressor pressure ratio, engine mass flow rate, and cooling flow fractions fixed. Related work has focused on <b>topping</b> with pressure-exchangers (i. e., wave rotors that provide pressure gain with zero net shaft power output); however, more energy can be added to a wave-engine-topped cycle leading to greater engine specific-power-enhancement The energy addition occurs at a lower pressure in the wave-engine-topped cycle; thus the specific-fuel-consumption-enhancement effected by ideal wave engine <b>topping</b> is slightly lower than that effected by ideal pressure-exchanger <b>topping.</b> At a component level, however, flow turning affords the wave engine a degree-of-freedom relative to the pressure-exchanger that enables a more efficient match with the baseline engine. In some cases, therefore, the SFC-enhancement by wave engine <b>topping</b> is greater than that by pressure-exchanger <b>topping.</b> An ideal wave-rotor-characteristic is used to identify key wave engine design parameters and to contrast the wave engine and pressure-exchanger <b>topping</b> approaches. An aerodynamic design procedure is described in which wave engine design-point performance levels are computed using a one-dimensional wave rotor model. Wave engines using various wave cycles are considered including two-port cycles with on-rotor combustion (valved-combustors) and reverse-flow and through-flow four-port cycles with heat addition in conventional burners. A through-flow wave cycle design with symmetric blading is used to assess engine performance benefits. The wave-engine-topped turboshaft engine produces 16 % more power than does a pressure-exchanger-topped engine under the specified <b>topping</b> constraints. Positive and negative aspects of wave engine <b>topping</b> in gas turbine engines are identified...|$|R
