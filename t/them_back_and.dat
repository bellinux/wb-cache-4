They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth, gossip about them.

Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him {{nothing more than a}} pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back {{as they made}} a bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Darryl accepts <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E

As they leave, Randall pleads to take <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> then says {{he had gone to}} school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a window that releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They regag Randall and return to the farm. Rick tells Shane that he will need to follow his orders to remain part of the group.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's {{first play}} on the new drive was stopped for a loss, and the Hoosiers were forced to punt after a short gain was nullified by a Paci sack on third down. The kick was a short one, and Tech began its second drive from IU's 49-yard line. The first play was stopped for no gain, DeShazo threw two {{incomplete}} passes, and Virginia Tech punted after going three and out. Indiana recovered the ball at its 23-yard line, where their offense began work. A five-yard false start penalty against the Hoosiers pushed <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> Indiana was stopped for little gain {{on the first two}} plays of its drive. On the third play, however, Paci connected on a 75-yard pass to Thomas Lewis, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown and the game's first points. Following the extra point kick, Indiana had a 70 lead with 5:36 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Maslama then disappears {{from the}} sources and re-emerges in 725, shortly after Yazid's {{death and the}} {{accession}} of Hisham, who sent Maslama to replace al-Djarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami in the Caucasus front against the Khazars. Initially, however, Maslama was mostly active in the Byzantine front, and {{the war against the}} Khazars was delegated to al-Harith ibn Amr al-Ta'i. In winter 725, Maslama led an expedition against Asia Minor from Melitene, which culminated in the sack of Caesarea on 13 January 726. Along with the capture of Gangra by Abdallah al-Battal in 727, {{this was one of the}} major successes of Arab arms against the Byzantines in the 720s. A few months later, he also led the otherwise unremarkable northern summer expedition into Byzantine territory. In 727–728, his attention was diverted by Khazar attacks which reached deep into Azerbaijan. Although Maslama was able to drive <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> recover control of the Darial Pass, his 728 campaign across the Caucasus was difficult, bloody and indecisive. Maslama's troops were reportedly engaged in up to thirty or forty days of constant fighting in miserable weather, and although he claimed victory in a battle over the Khazar khagan himself, the expedition did not achieve any results, and came close to being defeated. Certainly it did little to stop Khazar attacks south of the Caucasus, which resumed in 729. Maslama was removed from office in the same year, and replaced by al-Djarrah. He is then recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor as having been responsible for the sack of the fortress of Charsianon in late 730, but Arab sources credit Mu'awiya ibn Hisham for this act.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March the Spanish sloop {{returned}} to the island. Although the sloop was well-armed and manned, Captain Herbert resolved to try to capture it. A total of 96 men boarded the captain's barge, the yawl, a periagua (three periaguas had been captured near Cuba and carried on the Tyger) and a canoe and attacked the sloop. Although the boarding parties reached {{the deck of the}} sloop, the Spanish were able to force <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sail away.

25|$|However, San Diego {{took the}} second half kickoff and quickly racked up yardage with an 18-yard run by Chuck Muncie and a 45-yard {{completion}} from Fouts to Joiner. Fouts eventually finished the 70-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Joiner, making the score 14-10. Then late in the third quarter, the Chargers forced the Bills to punt from their own 8-yard line and got the ball with great field position on the Buffalo 49. Fouts then led the team to the 1, but a penalty pushed <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> they ended up settling for Rolf Benirschke's 22-yard field goal to make it 14–13.|$|E

However, unfavourable winds pushed <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the entourage had to return to shore and seek refuge at the temple Tainei-ji (大寧寺) in Nagato. By this time, only 20 men remained with Yoshitaka. Seeing no way out of their predicament, Yoshitaka composed his death poem and committed seppuku on September 30. The rest of his entourage, including his prepubescent sons, his close retainers, and courtiers from the imperial court, soon perished, either following Yoshitaka in suicide or killed by the rebel forces.|$|E
25|$|More monumental {{than the}} three panels that preceded it, the two figures {{dominate}} the foreground of Eight Bells, {{and the details}} of the ship are minimally rendered. Homer has taken some artistic license, showing the figure at left using an octant to take a reading of the sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his octant. In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon. The moment is prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image. In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.|$|E
25|$|Among the European settlers, hoop-rolling was a {{seasonal}} sport, seeing the greatest {{activity in the}} winter. Children, besides rolling the hoops, also tossed <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth, catching them on their sticks. In the 1830s, hoop trundling {{was seen as an}} activity so characteristic of the young that it was adopted by a fanatic sect in Kentucky whose members mimicked children's activities in order to gain access to heaven. Hoop driving was also seen as a remedy for the sedentary and overprotected lives led by many American girls of the mid-19th century. The game was popular with both girls and boys: in an 1898 survey of 1000 boys and 1000 girls in Massachusetts, both the girls and the boys named hoop and stick their favorite toy. In Ohio, the wood of the American elm (Ulmus americana) was particularly valued for making hoop-poles.|$|E

25|$|The third match, against Canterbury, saw Bula hit {{a career}} highest score – in a high-scoring match, 1224 runs were hit in three days, and Bula made 183 of those, split over two innings.

A loss against Otago followed, where Bula made {{insignificant}} scores, before a full-strength Auckland team were defeated by 115 runs in a good come-back – Fiji had trailed by 52 runs on first innings after Auckland declared on 181 for 8, but Bula and Harry Apted added 135 for the second wicket as Fiji posted 351/7. Set 300 to win, Auckland were bowled out by Fenn (6–94) and Isoa Logavatu (4–46).|$|E
