The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.|$|E

[...] The Chicago Times described the defendants as [...] "arch counselors of riot, pillage, incendiarism and murder"; other reporters described them as [...] "bloody brutes", [...] "red ruffians", [...] "dynamarchists", [...] "bloody monsters", [...] "cowards", [...] "cutthroats", [...] "thieves", [...] "assassins", and [...] "fiends". The journalist George Frederic Parsons wrote a piece for The Atlantic Monthly in which he identified the fears of middle-class Americans concerning labor radicalism, and asserted that the workers had only themselves to blame for their troubles. Edward Aveling remarked, [...] "If these men are ultimately hanged, {{it will be the}} Chicago Tribune <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> it." [...] Schaack, who had led the investigation, was dismissed from the police force for allegedly having fabricated evidence in the case but was reinstated in 1892.|$|E

2500|$|Utley had a {{slow start}} to spring training. [...] He was hitting only [...]175 (10 for 57), {{including}} 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. [...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when I felt a little uncomfortable and {{a little out of}} sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season." [...] Despite a poor spring training, over {{the first two weeks of}} the season, he was [...] "the hottest hitter in baseball", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.|$|E

2500|$|Lucas's {{standing}} {{as a literary}} critic was probably at its highest in the 1930s [...] [...] "In three respects," [...] the Times Literary Supplement noted in 1934, [...] "Lucas rises pre-eminent from the crowd of contemporary critics: in his care for style, for dignity and grace in his method of presentment: in his learning {{in the literature of}} several languages: and in the balance, the sanity of his judgment." [...] Post-war, reviewers were often more hostile. Many post-war reviews amounted to reprisals by the Leavisite camp: [...] "There is an air of breezy Bloomsbury superficiality and cultural omniscience about this book that is distressing," [...] wrote one. [...] "His is the type of over-cultivated fuddy-duddy mind <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> – and is doing – great damage to our whole culture in general and to literary appreciation in particular." [...] Probably because, psychoanalytic literary criticism aside, Lucas scorned most new trends – he described the critical theory of the 1950s as [...] "largely pseudo-scientific bubble-blowing" [...] – his criticism has long been out of fashion and is mostly out of print.|$|E
