In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would {{have to decide whether}} freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

In early 1980, after the Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States, a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden. In late 1980, after a three-question referendum produced mixed results, the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010. In 2010, the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors. The new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites, Oskarshamn, Ringhals or Forsmark, and only to replace one of the existing reactors, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be shut down for the new one to be able to start up.|$|E

2500|$|Whether a {{class action}} is {{superior}} to individual litigation depends on the case and {{is determined by the}} judge's ruling on a motion for class certification. The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 23, for example, states that mass torts are ordinarily [...] "not appropriate" [...] for class treatment. Class treatment may not improve the efficiency of a mass tort because the claims frequently involve individualized issues of law and fact <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be re-tried on an individual basis. See Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) (rejecting nationwide class action against tobacco companies). Mass torts also involve high individual damage awards; thus, the absence of class treatment will not impede the ability of individual claimants to seek justice. See id. Other cases, however, may be more conducive to class treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{funding of}} {{renewable}} energy (RE) projects {{is dependent on the}} credibility of the institutions developing and implementing RE policy. [...] This places a particular burden on the energy regulators in Africa—whose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only a decade or so. [...] Rules (micro policies) made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government RE policy and depend on some delegation of authority from the state. [...] Nevertheless, there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concerns—providing facts, reports, and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards RE. Clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations. Interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies, incentives, and administrative processes (including licensing and permitting). [...] Of course, the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes. This micro policy making role is derived from the fact that macro RE policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional. This point is particularly important in the area {{of renewable energy}}, with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public (and political) attitudes. [...] Gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators, with their functional responsibilities, technical expertise, and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries. Thus, for designing auctions for purchased power, for establishing Feed-in Tariffs, or other instruments promoting RE, the energy sector regulator has {{a significant impact on the}} penetration of RE in Africa and other regions.|$|E
