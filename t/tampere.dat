5|$|After a heavy, {{concentrated}} artillery barrage, the White Guards began advancing {{from house}} to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April the Whites reached the eastern river banks of Tammerkoski. The Reds' major attempts to break the siege of <b>Tampere</b> from outside, along the Helsinki-Tampere railway, failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The <b>Tampere</b> City Hall was among the last strongholds of the Red troops. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the Pyynikki and Pispala sections of <b>Tampere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} performance, Final Symphony II was {{performed}} in several other venues. It was first performed in London (United Kingdom) at the Barbican Centre by the London Symphony Orchestra on September 12, 2015. The London Symphony Orchestra then travelled to Japan to perform the concert in Osaka on September 27, and twice in Yokohama on October 4, {{the first time that}} a non-Japanese orchestra played a video game music concert in Japan. The 2016 performances of the concert were a concert on April 1 at the <b>Tampere</b> Hall in <b>Tampere,</b> Finland by the <b>Tampere</b> Philharmonic Orchestra, and a June 9 concert by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the Stockholm Concert Hall in Stockholm, Sweden. The <b>Tampere</b> concert featured an extra encore piano performance in addition to the two encores performed at all concerts.|$|E
5|$|Final Symphony was {{followed}} by Final Symphony II, a concert of music from Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX, and XIII. It features long arrangements like the Final Symphony concerts. The majority of the music was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, while the Final Fantasy XIII suite was originally composed by Masashi Hamauzu. Valtonen created the arrangements for the Final Fantasy V section, Wanamo worked on the VIII and IX portions, and Hamauzu arranged his own compositions from XIII with orchestration by Valtonen. First announced was a concert to be performed at the Barbican Centre in London by the London Symphony Orchestra on September 12, 2015, and later an earlier performance on August 29 in Bonn, Germany by the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn was also announced. After the debut performances, the London Symphony Orchestra traveled to Japan to perform the concert there three times: in Osaka on September 27, and twice in Yokohama on October 4. 2016 performances of the concert included a concert on April 1 at the <b>Tampere</b> Hall in <b>Tampere,</b> Finland by the <b>Tampere</b> Philharmonic Orchestra, and a June 9 concert by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the Konserthuset in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Mannerheim {{decided to}} strike first at <b>Tampere.</b> He {{launched}} {{the attack on}} 16 March at Längelmäki, 65km north-east of the town. At the same time, the White Army began advancing along a northern and north-western frontline, through Vilppula–Kuru–Kyröskoski–Suodenniemi. Many Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic {{under the weight of}} the assault, while some detachments defended their posts relentlessly, and were able to slow the advance of the White Guards, who were unaccustomed to offensive warfare. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to <b>Tampere.</b> They cut off the Reds southward connection in Lempäälä on 24 March and westward in Siuro (Nokia, Finland) and Ylöjärvi on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|SAT {{had planned}} its first {{terminal}} tractor in Helsinki in the 1960s {{and the production}} and development was continued in Hämeenlinna in 1969. The Sisu terminal tractors became famous worldwide for their innovative design. Production was moved to <b>Tampere</b> in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In February 1918 General Mannerheim {{weighed the}} {{question}} of where to focus the general offensive of the Whites, between two strategically vital enemy strongholds: <b>Tampere,</b> Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered major advantages, the lack of combat skills of his army and potential for a major counterattack by the enemy in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{passengers}} were {{happy with the}} new train. In 2005, a delegation of commuters between Helsinki and <b>Tampere</b> collected criticism from fellow passengers on the Internet and delivered it to VR's head of passenger transport Antti Jaatinen. The delegation's leader, Kaj-Erik Fohlin, had made 30 trips between the two cities in January 2005 using the Pendolino, 12 {{of which had been}} on schedule.|$|E
5|$|The Kauhajoki school {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} 23 September 2008, at the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences {{in the former}} province of Western Finland. The gunman, 22-year-old student Matti Juhani Saari, shot and killed ten people with a Walther P22 semi-automatic pistol, before shooting himself in the head. He died {{a few hours later}} in <b>Tampere</b> University Hospital. One woman was injured but was in a stable condition.|$|E
5|$|A 800–1,000-strong Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of <b>Tampere</b> and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in <b>Tampere</b> and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in <b>Tampere,</b> the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the {{military}} focus to Viipuri; 18,500 Whites raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. General Mannerheim's Vyborg plan {{was affected by}} the battle for <b>Tampere,</b> the civilian industrial town. He aimed to avoid a new bloody city combat, in Viipuri - the old border ground military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to destroy and bind the Red force outside Viipuri, and conquer the lamed town area in a mild battle. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops, in the fierce combats, in the Karelian Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained in besieged Viipuri. The final attack to the city began on late 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the Whites conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - {{in the center of}} Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total 400 Whites and 500–600 Reds died and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in <b>Tampere</b> rose up to take the lead, {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{life has}} also {{been the subject of}} several stage productions. Two musicals, Little Tramp and Chaplin, were {{produced}} in the early 1990s. In 2006, Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical, , which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for Broadway two years later, re-titled Chaplin – A Musical. Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, two plays about Chaplin premiered in Finland: Chaplin at the Svenska Teatern, and Kulkuri (The Tramp) at the <b>Tampere</b> Workers' Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} performance, Final Symphony was {{performed}} in several other venues. It was first performed in London (United Kingdom) at the Barbican Centre by the London Symphony Orchestra on May 30, 2013. Between 2014 and 2016, additional concerts took place in Tokyo (Japan), Aarhus (Denmark), Stockholm (Sweden), <b>Tampere</b> (Finland), Amsterdam (Netherlands), San Diego (United States), Baltimore (United States), San Francisco (United States) and in Auckland (New Zealand), with each performance location handled by a different orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study on}} the {{different}} motivations of walkthrough viewers conducted by Max Sjöblom and Juho Hamari from the University of <b>Tampere</b> in 2016, numerous viewer motivations were discussed. From the findings, the five the most significant motivations were found to be improving player experience, confidence, knowledge about a particular game, socializing and creating an 'escape' or distraction from their everyday life. Walkthroughs may also guide players throughout an entire game or only certain sections and may be guides on finding rare collectables or unlocking achievements.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of <b>Tampere</b> and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{additional}} Pendolinos {{were ordered}} {{at the end}} 1997 {{at the price of}} FIM 77 million per train (€13 million). They were delivered between 2000 and 2002. The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes. The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend: they started running between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001. In June 2002, the network was expanded further, and routes were continued from <b>Tampere</b> onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio. One of the main series trains (number 7x08) was damaged during maritime transport in October 2001. The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic, almost causing the loss of M/S Traden, the ship carrying it. Thanks to good actions of the ship's crew, it was able to reach Le Havre and the train was sent back to Italy to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Filatov {{has played}} {{extensively}} for Russia's national teams in under-18 and under-20 tournaments. His first IIHF competition for Russia was the 2007 U18 Championship {{held in the}} Finnish cities of Rauma and <b>Tampere.</b> Russia {{won a gold medal}} in that tournament, and as an underaged player, Filatov contributed four goals and five assists in seven games. He led the Russian team in total points and was second to Alexei Cherepanov in goals scored. After this tournament, Russia's coaches named Filatov as one of the team's three best players. Filatov also played at the 2008 U18 Championship held in his native Russia, in Kazan. Filatov captained the team to a silver medal, scoring three goals and adding six assists. He was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{extinguished}} {{the fires}} without any major {{damage to the}} school. Saari remained at large for {{some time in the}} school grounds after they had been evacuated. Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to have spoken to Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that he wanted to say goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to <b>Tampere</b> University Hospital, where he was treated for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E
5|$|In Fennia, Juha Vainio met {{his future}} wife Taina Kaukonen. When Taina became {{pregnant}} in early 1960, Juha's parents scolded the young father. As a result, the couple married {{in the summer of}} 1960 and a son Ilkka followed in October of the same year. Juha and Taina had three more children: Sami in 1961, Kalle in 1963 and Kati in 1967. At first the young couple lived at Juha's parents', but moved to Helsinki when Juha started his studies there. He studied at the Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu (School of Social Sciences, which later became the University of <b>Tampere)</b> and later the Opettajakorkeakoulu (School of Vocational Teacher Education) where he graduated as a school teacher.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in <b>Tampere</b> in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{pieces were}} {{arranged}} by Masashi Hamauzu, {{one of the}} composers for Final Fantasy X, along with Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, and the arranged works are based on compositions by him and Nobuo Uematsu, who acts as a consultant for the concerts. Thomas Böcker is producing the concerts, {{as he had done}} for numerous other video game music concerts in Germany, Sweden and Japan (Symphonic Game Music Concert series). Eckehard Stier conducts, who is experienced in the field of video game music due to his work on the CD album Drammatica by Yoko Shimomura and the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Tokyo. The concert featured pianist Benyamin Nuss in 2013 (Wuppertal and London), Mischa Cheung in 2014 (<b>Tampere),</b> with Katharina Treutler being the main pianist of the concert series, performing at the events in Tokyo, Aarhus and Stockholm in 2014, and Amsterdam, San Diego, Baltimore and San Francisco in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in <b>Tampere,</b> Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, 2014, Merregnon Studios {{announced}} {{that they would be}} producing an album for the concert, to be published the following year. Unlike prior Merregnon Studios concert albums, the Final Symphony album would not be a recording of one of the performances but would instead be a studio recording of the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, produced especially for the album. The version of the concert recorded was the one used in the final performance in <b>Tampere,</b> rather than the one originally performed by the London Symphony Orchestra in 2013. The performance was recorded on December 15–17, was conducted by Eckehard Stier, and featured a piano performance by Katharina Treutler. Nobuo Uematsu supervised the production of the album. The album was published by X5 Music Group, who had previously published the Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo album for Merregnon Studios. It was released as a digital album on February 23, 2015, while a preview of the album was performed on British radio station Classic FM on February 21. Prior to the album's release, the only available recording of the concert was a video of the Stockholm performance of the Final Fantasy VI symphonic poem by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, released on their website on October 10, 2014. A physical version of the album was released on Blu-ray on September 16, 2015. A promotional mini-album was released on April 23, 2015, containing the Final Fantasy VI symphonic poem, and one part each from the Final Fantasy VII and X sections of the concert. In December 2016, Laced Records released the Final Symphony album on double CD and triple vinyl.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in <b>Tampere</b> and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E

Their intention was to proceed to the town of Jyväskylä in Central Finland and reach the Haapamäki–Jyväskylä and Jyväskylä–Pieksämäki railways. As the Whites launched their offensive against <b>Tampere,</b> Länkipohja's location was strategically important as the village closed the way to the town.|$|E
