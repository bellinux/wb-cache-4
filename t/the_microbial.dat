40|$|AbstractThe BIOLOG {{method was}} applied to {{exploration}} of functional diversity of soil microbial communities in sludge-amended soils sampled from the Yangtze River Delta. Results indicated that metabolic profile, functional diversity indexes and Kinetic parameters of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities changed following soil amendment with sewage sludge, suggesting that the changes occurred in population of the microbes capable of exploiting carbon substrates and in this capability as well. The kinetic study of the functional diversity revealed that the metabolic profile of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities exhibited non-linear correlation with the incubation time, showing a curse of sigmoid that fits the dynamic model of growth of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities. In all the treatments, except for treatments of coastal fluvo-aquic soil amended with fresh sludge and dried sludge from Hangzhou, kinetic parameters K and r of the functional diversity of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities decreased significantly and parameter S increased. Changes in characteristics of the functional diversity well reflected differences in C utilizing capacity and model of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities in <b>the</b> sludge-amended soils, and changes in functional diversity of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> communities in a particular eco-environment, like soil amended with sewage sludge...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{synthetic}} pesticides on <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community have been thoroughly investigated {{in the past}} mostly by culture-dependent methods and only few recent studies have used culture-independent approaches for this purpose. However, {{it should be noted}} that most of these studies have been conducted in microcosms where <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community is exposed to unrealistic concentrations of the pesticides, providing an unrealistic exposure scheme for soil microorganism. On the other hand, little is known regarding the potential impact of botanical pesticides on <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community. Therefore, a laboratory study and a field study were conducted to investigate the effects of synthetic (metham sodium [MS], sodium tetrathiocarbonate [SoTe], and fosthiazate) and botanical pesticides (azadirachtin, quillaja, and pulverized Melia azedarach fruits [PMF]) on <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the results of the laboratory study indicated that the application of PMF resulted in significant changes in <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community. This was obvious by the proportional increase in the abundance of fatty acids 18 : 1 omega 9 cis, 18 : 1 omega 9 trans, which are common in gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi, and 18 : 2 omega 6, 9, which is a fungal indicator. This response was attributed to the release of copious amounts of organic carbon and nutrients in the soil by the PMF. On the other hand, MS inhibited fungi and gram-negative bacteria, while fosthiazate and the botanical pesticides quillaja and azadirachtin did not impose significant changes in <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community. Similar results were obtained by the field study where application of the fumigants MS and SoTe significantly altered the structure of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community with <b>the</b> former having a more prominent effect. Fosthiazate imposed mild changes in <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community, whereas quillaja and azadirachtin again did not show a significant effect. Overall, botanical pesticides, at their recommended dose, did not alter the structure of <b>the</b> soil <b>microbial</b> community compared to synthetic nonfumigant and fumigant pesticides which induced significant changes...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E

5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. <b>The</b> <b>microbial</b> communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true diversity of <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> world {{because of their}} exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E
