5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E

In this case, as shown, <b>the</b> {{upstream}} <b>pipes</b> {{are made}} from 10 ft sections of perforated 4" [...] PVC <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> perforations allow water to enter <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>The</b> upstream ends of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> have a 90 degree elbow pointing downward into the water, and are anchored to steel fence post supports at the upstream end of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> {{as well as in}} the notch. <b>The</b> perforated <b>pipe</b> is joined to non-perforated <b>pipe</b> at <b>the</b> notch, and then appropriate elbows are used to drop <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> to <b>the</b> downstream position for water to exit. Threaded caps are placed on the final section, and then plugged with end caps. Steel fence post supports are used on the downstream portion as well to hold <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> in position. Flexible galvanized wire is best to attache <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> to <b>the</b> posts.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{long-term}} flow scouring action during {{the operation of}} underwater oil pipelines, <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> gradually become thin. Under the action of external force, holes occur in <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> and oil spills out, driven by the constant pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
30|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} {{to fit the}} bent metal inner pipe with respect to <b>the</b> outer <b>pipe</b> such that only the two ends of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> are in {{contact with each other}} by adjusting the flexural rigidity of <b>the</b> inner <b>pipe</b> with slits as shown in Fig. 2 b. Thus, the friction between <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> can be reduced even if <b>the</b> inner <b>pipe</b> touches <b>the</b> outer <b>pipe</b> in areas other than the ends of <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> An inner pipe with optimally adjusted slit intervals can minimize the twist angle.|$|R
5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls {{from the}} 13th century onwards are less {{important}} for historical study {{because there are}} other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} of income {{recorded}} on <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls from the reign of Henry II on.|$|E

50|$|Operation of the ice-making {{equipment}} {{at the new}} Arena Gardens was delayed a week when <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> had to be relaid.

5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, {{all of which were}} done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E
5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls.|$|E
5|$|In 1129–30, Basset {{served as}} sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Surrey {{together}} with Aubrey de Vere II. The number of shrievalties was unusual, {{and is known}} from <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> Roll of 1130. According to the entries in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> Roll, de Vere and Basset did not function as traditional sheriffs, farming the revenues, but were instead responsible for the entire royal revenue in those counties.|$|E

5|$|The {{example of}} the royal exchequer's records {{eventually}} influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls {{are those of the}} Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} compression wave, now greatly {{reinforced by}} the second 'puff' of air, sets off on another two trips down <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> (travelling 4 pipe lengths in total) before the cycle is repeated again.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied a}} new type of flowmeter, the bypass flowmeter. It is {{suitable}} for large-scale <b>pipes.</b> <b>The</b> principle of bypass flowmeter is studied by analyzing flowing in parallel pipes and carrying out experiments at a modified performance test system for centrifugal pumps. The study results showed that the flowrate ratio between <b>the</b> main <b>pipe</b> and <b>the</b> bypass <b>pipe</b> is determined by the geometric structures of <b>pipes</b> and <b>the</b> flowing states in <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>The</b> flowrate ratio varies greatly when the Reynolds numbers are relatively lower both in <b>the</b> main <b>pipe</b> and <b>the</b> bypass <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> flowrate ratio keeps constant when the Reynolds number in <b>the</b> main <b>pipe</b> is larger than 120000. The head loss becomes smaller when <b>the</b> bypass <b>pipe</b> is connected to <b>the</b> main <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> percentage of head loss decrease is from 7. 64 % to 9. 34 %. The results indicate that bypass flowmeter is suitable for flowrate measuring in large scale pipes. It will not cause additional head loss to the flow...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are also}} used in lining and trench-less technologies, the {{so-called}} no-dig applications where <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> are installed without digging trenches without any disruption above ground.

These solutions are therefore helping engineers to rehabilitate antiquated pipe systems. Excavation is minimal and the process is carried out quickly below ground.|$|R
