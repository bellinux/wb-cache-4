But when fluid temperature is varying rapidly as during start-up, quite appreciable differences occur between the true temperature and the measured temperature because of the time required for the transfer of heat to the thermocouple placed inside a heavy <b>thermometer</b> <b>pocket.</b> In this paper, two different techniques for determining transient fluid temperature based on the first and second order thermometer model are presented. The fluid temperature was determined using measured thermometer temperature, which is suddenly immersed into boiling water. To demonstrate the applicability of the presented method to actual data, the air temperature which changes in time, was calculated based on the temperature readings from the sheathed thermocouple...|$|E

Similarly on the outlet waterbox the cooling water connection will have large flanges, butterfly valves, vent connection also at higher level and drain connections at lower level. Similarly <b>thermometer</b> <b>pockets</b> are located at inlet and outlet pipes for local measurements of cooling water temperature.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for designing <b>thermometer</b> <b>pockets</b> {{having a good}} performance in rapidly changing steam conditions. For quick response, the bore diameter and tip wall thickness are minimized while, for safety reasons, the pocket is made conical: a low net error is achieved by choosing dimensions such that {{the positive and negative}} errors cancel out. The design theory, which takes account of the effects of fluid tempera-ture gradients (on the assumption of fully developed turbulent flow) is discussed in detail and a practical guide is also given. Although the emphasis is primarily on steam pipes, much of the theory is of interest to the general field of fluid temperature measurement...|$|R

60|$|Reaching Cairo, I found Dr. T. E. Maclean from Thebes, {{with good}} instruments. He kindly {{compared}} mine with his, {{and gave me}} the following results:--The difference between my aneroid (Casella) and his is very slight, varying generally from 0.05 to -0.10. He advises me to neglect this slight difference. The dry bulb is, on the whole, a little higher than his; {{and we have not}} sufficient observations for the wet bulb. The <b>pocket</b> <b>thermometer</b> wants correction; it reads from +1 deg. to +2 deg. 15'.|$|R
60|$|From {{the chest}} came an overpowering spicy odour, {{and with it}} a veritable breath of warm air before which we recoiled a little. Bickley took a <b>pocket</b> <b>thermometer</b> which he had at hand and glanced at it. It marked a {{temperature}} of 82 degrees in the sepulchre. Having noted this, he thrust it into the coffin between the crystal wall and its occupant. Then {{we went out and}} waited a little while to give the odours time to dissipate, for they made the head reel.|$|R
