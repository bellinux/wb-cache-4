5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before <b>taxiing.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for <b>taxiing</b> and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E

40|$|Part VI: Services, Supply Chains and OperationsInternational audienceWe propose {{improvement}} {{method of}} service productivity for <b>Taxi</b> Company of rearranging <b>taxi</b> drivers working hours. There are two ways a <b>taxi</b> company gets customers. One is to deliver <b>taxi</b> for a telephone request, {{and the other is}} to get customers on street. In Japan, there are many <b>taxi</b> companies where the ratio of the former method is higher. Therefore we research rearrangement method of the <b>taxi</b> drivers working hours so as to operate many <b>taxis</b> with many telephone requests.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of {{rainfall}} on the temporal and spatial distribution of <b>taxi</b> passengers. The main objective is to provide guidance for <b>taxi</b> scheduling on rainy days. To this end, we take the occupied and empty states of <b>taxis</b> as units of analysis. By matching a <b>taxi's</b> GPS data to its taximeter data, we can obtain the <b>taxi's</b> operational time and the <b>taxi</b> driver's income from every unit of analysis. The ratio of <b>taxi</b> operation time to <b>taxi</b> drivers' income is used to measure the quality of <b>taxi</b> passengers. The research results show that the spatio-temporal evolution of urban <b>taxi</b> service demand differs based on rainfall conditions and hours of operation. During non-rush hours, <b>taxi</b> demand in peripheral areas is significantly reduced under increasing precipitation conditions, whereas during rush hours, the demand for highly profitable <b>taxi</b> services steadily increases. Thus, as an intelligent response for <b>taxi</b> operations and dispatching, <b>taxi</b> services should guide cruising <b>taxis</b> to high-demand regions to increase their service time and ride opportunities...|$|R
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when <b>taxiing.</b> The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistake was}} easy to make, Le Culot was located nearby. Sint-Truiden housed the 48th Fighter Group and 404th Fighter Group. The 492nd Fighter Squadron was readying to take off at 09:20. JG 4 hit the {{airfield}} at 09:15. Several P-47s <b>taxiing</b> out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction. The small-scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No damage was done at Le Culot airfield.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer was {{transferred}} to IV Gruppe of NJG1 (IV./NJG1—4th group of the 1st Night Fighter Wing), based in the Netherlands at Leeuwarden Air Base, where he was appointed Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 12. Staffel (12./NJG1—12th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing) on 13 August 1943. He took over command from Oberleutnant Eberhard Gardiewski, who had been taken prisoner of war. At the time, IV./NJG1 was {{under the leadership of}} Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Jabs. Jabs' first impression of Schnaufer was not entirely favourable. Shortly after Schnaufer's arrival, on one of his first missions in Leeuwarden, Schnaufer had taken right of way during <b>taxiing.</b> This forced Jabs into second place in order of takeoff, an act of insubordination and perceived as arrogant by Jabs.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic <b>taxiing</b> to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was <b>taxiing.</b> The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and <b>taxiing.</b> Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and <b>taxiing,</b> especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|A bitumen-surfaced second runway {{was built}} at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, {{after which the}} {{original}} runway was only used for emergencies and <b>taxiing.</b> The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, and a transhipment and staging area, overhaul facilities for PT boats, a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed. Milne Bay {{was used as a}} staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December.
