5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are <b>tagged</b> for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is <b>tagged</b> with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the <b>tagged</b> protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{televised}} broadcast, Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, the 1–2–3 Kid, and Marty Jannetty face Diesel, Irwin R. Schyster, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Prior to the match, Ramon announced that Savage was taking the place of Perfect, who was unable to appear. Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring, but Martel soon <b>tagged</b> out to bring Bomb into the match. Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent. Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument. The 1–2–3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel. After the Kid <b>tagged</b> out, Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match. Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually <b>tagged</b> Savage back into the match. Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle, however, which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match. Ramon then performed a Razor's Edge on Schyster and pinned him. Ramon attempted the same move on Martel, but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase. Ramon {{fell out of the}} ring and was counted out of the match. The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth, but the 1–2–3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip. Almost immediately, Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team.|$|E

The <b>tagging</b> system provides a particular kind. For content-based <b>tags,</b> the suggested <b>tags</b> may be significant terms because of their term frequency. For example, information in Fig.  1 is suggested with the <b>tag</b> Rice because the term rice has maximum frequency. Regarding semantic similarity, multiple <b>tags</b> may have the same meaning or may refer to the same thing. For example, Kao Horm Mali is jasmine rice in Thai with English spelling.
