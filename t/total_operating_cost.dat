50|$|Particle size in {{the feed}} {{is one of the}} most {{important}} parameters to be taken into account since the choice of slot and screen holes size of screen scroll centrifuge or different types of process depends on feed contents. Non-uniform particles {{size in the}} feed can cause partial blockage on the screen due to the small size solids blocking the holes besides normal and larger particles. So, liquids flow over the screen instead of passing through it. As such, it requires higher solids content in the feed in order to obtain good and reasonable results - normally greater than 15% and up to 60% w/w. Nevertheless, the flow rate of the feed can be monitored to overcome this setback. Another possible method is to carry out pre-treatment on the feed to be used for screen scroll centrifuge, for example, by filtration process. Particle size, thereafter, can be analysed and the selection of particular screen size can be determined. However, it increases the <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E

Mining of silver and silver-tin veins from Cerro Rico, a volcanic mountain adjacent to Potosi, began in the mid 1500s and has been continuous for over 450 years. In the 1650s, Potosi was the largest city {{in the western hemisphere}} with 160,000 residents. Today, up to 15,000 people make a living mining small underground silver-tin veins. The property consists of approximately 4,800 hectares of surface mineral claims that encompass gravel deposits or silver-bearing rock along the flank of Cerro Rico. Coeur acquired the San Bartolome property in 1999 and began current mining operations in 2008. The San Bartolomé Mine involves free digging of mineralized gravels along the flanks of Cerro Rico.
