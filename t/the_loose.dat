5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E

5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have prickly foliage and domed flowerheads.

5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. <b>The</b> <b>loose</b> piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E

5|$|Ape Escape was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from critics, with praise particularly directed at the innovative use of the dual analog controls, {{as well as the}} graphics and music; the voice acting received minor criticism. The game is widely considered {{to be one of the}} greatest on the PlayStation console, and received several re-releases. The game also spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, beginning with Ape Escape 2 in 2001. A remake, Ape Escape: On <b>the</b> <b>Loose,</b> was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 to mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|Ape Escape {{was officially}} {{announced}} in the April 1999 issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Promotions for the game were held on Cartoon Network during Sony's winter holiday marketing campaign of 1999. A remake of the game, titled Ape Escape: On <b>the</b> <b>Loose,</b> was announced on May 11, 2004, during Sony's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on March 24, 2005. The remake features altered controls, {{due to the lack}} of a right analog stick on the PSP, as well as some slightly different graphics and mini-games.|$|E

The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt.

5|$|Beginning in March 2008, Rutgers {{attempted}} to convert Westerman to defensive tackle, {{so he could}} replace the departed Eric Foster. However, Westerman ended up playing defensive end during the season. Against Morgan State, Westerman blocked a punt and recovered <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> ball. Westerman suffered a torn biceps against Louisville {{and was forced to}} sit {{out the rest of the}} season which included a bowl game. Despite his injury, he led Rutgers with six sacks on the season.|$|E

The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball any closer to the end zone, and settled for a 38-yard field goal by kicker A. J. Principe, giving them a 3–0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After an incomplete pass from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A short run after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. <b>The</b> <b>loose</b> ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw an incomplete pass, was sacked, then threw a pass for a loss of yardage. Tech punted the ball, which was downed at the Florida State 12-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and fumbled the ball. <b>The</b> <b>loose</b> ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown.

40|$|Abstract. Model {{experiment}} box for {{crushed rock}} layer {{to eliminate the}} differential settlement was designed. Through the model experiment, the effect of eliminating differential settlement was validated and {{the truth of it}} was analyzed. Then the concept and the expressions of <b>the</b> secondary <b>loose</b> coefficient was established. Through measuring <b>the</b> secondary <b>loose</b> coefficient of different rock layers by designed measure box, the relationships of grain diameter of crushed rock, grain figure of gravel and the friction angle with <b>the</b> secondary <b>loose</b> coefficient were analyzed respectively. The research indicated that (1) the design of model experiment box and the experiment was successful; (2) crushed rock layer which can eliminate the differential settlement mostly depends on its capability of secondary loose; (3) <b>the</b> secondary <b>loose</b> coefficient increases with grain diameter of crushed rock and the friction angle, and <b>the</b> secondary <b>loose</b> coefficient of crushed rock is always higher than that of the pebble at the same grain diameter...|$|R
