5|$|In April 1997, Harper {{suggested}} that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and ignoring the principles of economic conservatism. The Liberal Party lost seats but managed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> narrow majority government in the 1997 federal election, while Reform made only modest gains.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 21 June 1919, {{permitted}} Germany <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> surface fleet of eight obsolete battleships. This amounted to three of the Deutschland-class battleships, Hannover, Schleswig-Holstein and Schlesien, {{as well as the}} five s.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E

5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> {{consistent}} {{shape of}} the Stanley Cup, as there is only sufficient space for thirteen teams {{on each of the}} five lower bands, team names can only remain on the cup for 64 years. In 2005 the band for teams from 1941 to 1953 were removed and placed on display, thus Teeder Kennedy's name no longer appears on the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious that {{from the very beginning}} Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended as a tool <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> grip on Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} change to US-412 {{occurred}} on November 4, 1991, when US-412 was rerouted on{{to the new}}ly built Cherokee Turnpike. US-412 Scenic, which was later redesignated US-412 Alternate, was established along the old highway, allowing the highway system <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> free alternate to the new toll road. US-412 was extended west on May 5, 1993; like its initial extension into Oklahoma, this new portion of US-412 followed existing highways: US-56, US-64, US-270, and SH-3.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} have replaced earlier community functions, but continue <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E

Despite the company's financial difficulties, in 2015, Buffon, who had by then acquired 56% of the company's shares, had reportedly invested €20million in order to save the company from bankruptcy. In late December, Zucchi was acquired by a French investment fund, Astrance Capital, which took control of Buffon's company GB Holding, under an agreement to restructure Zucchi Group's debt, while Buffon was allowed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> 15% share in the company.|$|E
5|$|Slammiversary {{is remembered}} for Joe {{being the first}} <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> {{championship}} in a King of the Mountain match. 20,000 was the reported figure of purchasers for the event by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Slammiversary had an attendance of 2,000 people. Jon Waldman of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10, which was lower than the 8 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Jason Clevett. After the event, an accident occurred {{which resulted in the}} death of one man and the injury of another.|$|E
5|$|The Maple Leafs, {{struggling}} once again, {{decided to}} start a rebuild in early 2015. Thus Phaneuf, a veteran defenceman with a lengthy contract, began being shopped around. On March 2, 2015, Phaneuf was almost traded to the Detroit Red Wings, however the deal fell through {{at the last minute}} when Toronto refused <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> large portion of Phaneuf's salary. He would play {{the rest of the year}} in Toronto. When Toronto hired head coach Mike Babcock the following season, Phaneuf excelled, experiencing fewer penalty minutes and better defensive play under his reduced minutes.|$|E

5|$|The next season, Bradman made an {{abortive}} bid to {{join the}} Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was {{led to believe that}} if he applied, he would get the job. The position, which had been held by Hugh Trumble until his death in August 1938, {{was one of the most}} prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of £1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> connection with the game. On 18 January 1939, the club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} placed into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works in 1948. The ministry carried out extensive repairs, attempting <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> {{mixture of the}} medieval and newer features in the building. They removed the old medieval elm and oak foundations {{and replaced them with}} concrete supports, and installed a replacement roof in 1949, removing the first floor entrance and reinstalling the spiral staircase from the ground floor in 1953. The inside of the tower was rendered to hide the traces of the various work. The Jewel Tower was opened for tourists in 1956, and drew between 500 and 800 visitors each week.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is unique}} among moons of {{planetary}} mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune's rotation and inclined relative to Neptune's equator, {{which suggests that}} it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest irregular satellite in the Solar System, Saturn's moon Phoebe, has only 0.03% of Triton's mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a catastrophic event for Neptune's original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.|$|E

5|$|Dickov debuted for Blackburn Rovers as a half-time {{substitute}} against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2004. He scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} club in the following match, a 3–2 defeat to Southampton. Dickov {{was involved in the}} majority of matches in the 2004–05 season, until a knee injury caused him to miss the last few weeks of the season. He finished the season with ten league goals. In 2005–06, Dickov found it hard <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> regular place in the side, with manager Mark Hughes having signed forwards Craig Bellamy and Shefki Kuqi during the summer. A red card against West Ham United caused him to miss most of the first month of the season. He had a run of first team games in the autumn but starting appearances became fewer as the season progressed. He left the club in the summer of 2006 following the expiry of his contract.|$|E
5|$|During the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) eras, Nintendo and Capcom {{enjoyed a}} close relationship, with Mega Man {{as one of}} the NES' most {{prominent}} franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's monopoly of the video game console market, which allowed the company to compel third-party developers to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. Sega's rival Genesis system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>a</b> proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based PlayStation. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties—Capcom included—moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as Resident Evil. On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or over-stocking inventory which might eat into revenue. This third-party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} a log book (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a log book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature.
