5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded <b>the</b> <b>distractions</b> from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} effect of low {{intensity}} pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on new bone formation during mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) in rabbits. 24 rabbits underwent DO {{on the right side}} of the mandible. 12 rabbits received a daily 20 -min LIPUS (1. 5 MHz, 30 mW/cm 2) treatment on the first day of <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> until they were killed at week 0 (immediately after <b>the</b> <b>distraction),</b> week 2 and week 4 after <b>the</b> <b>distraction.</b> Four rabbits were killed at each time point. The other 12 rabbits followed the same protocol without the ultrasound treatment.

40|$|Eleven {{patients}} (8 males, 3 females) undergoing limb-lengthening {{procedures were}} subjected to weekly conventional radiography along with fortnightly skeletal sonography of <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> site, to assess the rate of new bone production and complications. The radiographs were assessed for: (i) distance between the distracted bone ends, (ii) presence of new bone formation at <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> site, (iii) regeneration of the cortical outline and (iv) overlaying soft tissue abnormality. The sonographs were assessed for: (i) distance between the distracted bone ends, (ii) rate of new bone formation, (iii) density of the new bone produced, (iv) integrity and continuity of the cortical outline and (v) overlaying soft tissue abnormality. Our results indicate the superiority of sonography over conventional radiographs in: (i) detecting early new bone formation, (ii) establishing cortical and medullary canal remodelling, (iii) detecting soft tissue complications at <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> site and (iv) determining the presence of fluid collection at <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> site, in patients with delayed consolidation.

In August 1691, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, regained the advantage by heavily defeating the Turks at the Battle of Slankamen on the Danube, securing Habsburg possession of Hungary and Transylvania. However, when Baden was transferred west to fight the French in 1692, his successors, first Caprara, then from 1696, Frederick Augustus, the Elector of Saxony, proved incapable of delivering the final blow. On {{the advice of the}} President of the Imperial War Council, Rüdiger Starhemberg, Eugene was offered supreme command of Imperial forces in April 1697. This was Eugene's first truly independent command—no longer need he suffer under the excessively cautious generalship of Caprara and Caraffa, or be thwarted by the deviations of Victor Amadeus. But on joining his army, he found it in a state of 'indescribable misery'.

25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, Terrell Owens, and all <b>the</b> <b>distractions</b> {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb's season was finally over after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To go along with that, he completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{investigate}} two different distraction methods, distraction cards and kaleidoscope, on pain and anxiety relief of children during phlebotomy. Methods: This {{study is a}} prospective, randomized and controlled trial. The sample consisted of 7 – 11 year-old children who required blood tests. Children were randomized into three groups: <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> cards group, <b>the</b> kaleidoscope group, and the control group. Data were obtained by interviewing the children with their parents and the observer {{before and after the}} procedure. The pain levels of the children were assessed by the parent and observer reports as well as self report using the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. The anxiety levels of children were assessed by parent and observer reports using Children Fear Scale. Results: One hundred and eighty-eight children (mean age, 8. 8  ±  1. 5 years) were included. The pain levels of children showed significant differences among the groups (p = . 005). Both <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> card group (2. 41  ±  2. 49) and the kaleidoscope group (3. 10  ±  2. 16) had lower pain levels than the control group did (4. 44  ±  3. 64). <b>The</b> <b>distraction</b> card group had the lowest pain levels (2. 41  ±  2. 49) among all groups.

Objectives: To recognize {{the various types of}} posterior column injury in terms of the path of <b>the</b> <b>distraction</b> force in flexion-dis-traction injuries of the thoracolumbar spine. Summary of Literature Review: As posterior column injuries are associated with instability of the spine, many authors have described and classified posterior column injuries.
