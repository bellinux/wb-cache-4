5|$|Despite {{its initial}} threat, Chris caused little {{impact in the}} Lesser Antilles. Overall damage from Chris was minimal. The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} in Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.09inches (78mm) in Fajardo. The rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> its banks, which temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island.|$|E

There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73.

5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared {{for the state of}} Oaxaca shortly after Pauline made landfall. Abundant rainfall caused the River Los Perros <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> its capacity, flooding 50municipalities in Oaxaca. The flooding damaged 12bridges, of which two were destroyed, and cut off some areas of electricity, drinking water, and telecommunications for several days. The passage of the hurricane affected thousands of houses, leaving roughly 250,000homeless in the state. At least 110people died in the state, with hundreds of thousands of residents and 1,278communities being affected.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> at about 05:20. There is {{evidence}} suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks <b>to</b> <b>overflow,</b> destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E

At least 50 flights {{in and out}} of the prefecture were also cancelled or delayed. Already hit by Typhoon Nari just a few days prior to Wipha, South Korea began evacuating residents as the remnants of the typhoon were expected to hit the country. Rainfall was expected to impact South Korea for several days with accumulations exceeding 150mm (6in). About 940 people were evacuated to shelters throughout the country.|$|E

Heavy rains stranded many cars while causing rivers <b>to</b> <b>overflow,</b> flooding communities. Damage totaled to $275 million (2007 MXN; $25 million).|$|E

Precipitation totals of up to 7.9 in (200mm) were recorded during the time.|$|E

Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers <b>to</b> <b>overflow,</b> resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the washing away of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were {{relatively}} light across the Dominican Republic, with a peak gust of 60mph occurring in Santo Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting {{to a maximum}} of 9.07inches (230mm) in Isla Saona. Several other locations reported over 4inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding, forcing several rivers <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> in combination with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone John {{extensively}} {{affected areas}} of Western Australia, but damage {{was not as}} bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25houses and caused rivers <b>to</b> <b>overflow.</b> The system was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.|$|E

Despite two {{consecutive}} stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> on the course and riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; {{this led to the}} cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg that drew some of its route from the Giro di Lombardia. An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River began <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> {{its banks}} in Nenana. Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad in town, caused an {{evacuation}} of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{affecting}} Guerrero, Hurricane Calvin {{was responsible}} for heavy rains and widespread flooding across Oaxaca. An estimated 7,000 were left homeless along the Oaxacan coast and on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In addition, travel from the isthmus was cut off due to mudslides that blocked portions of the Pan-American Highway. Two rivers threatened <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> their banks while the Benito, Juarez, and Yosocuta dams attained peak capacity and thus the gates were opened to prevent overflowing. A total of 42 communities were flooded. The cities of Tehuantepec, Salina Cruz, Juchtianm, and Tuxtepec were flooded due to extended periods of torrential rains. Across the state, the rains blocked highways and knocked out electrical, telephone, and water services. About 3,000people took refuge to shelters and one person was killed.|$|E

In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. A mobile home park in Plymouth County was inundated with 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing one home to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought intense monsoon {{conditions to}} Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha during its life. Over 210mm (8inches) {{of rain and}} winds of 85km/h (50mph) were recorded in Paradip as the depression made landfall on June 30. Inland, the heavy rains caused some rivers in Orissa <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> and flooded rice paddies in Cuttack District. Further west, the Wainganga River overflowed its banks in places. Road transport in Madhya Pradesh was disrupted and there was damage to crops in the Raipur area. Raipur recorded the highest 24-hour rains associated with the depression, with 230mm (9inches) falling there on July 2.|$|E

The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau <b>to</b> <b>overflow</b> the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E
