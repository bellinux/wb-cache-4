5|$|After {{four years}} in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President Richard Nixon {{appointed}} him {{general counsel for the}} Office of Telecommunications Policy, where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, an {{energetic}} movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> overturn bans on free speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109–110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.|$|E
5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier {{was interviewed by}} Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E

There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office).

5|$|Hergé {{referred}} to Müsstler's agents as the Iron Guard, thereby naming them after the real Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance.

Two versions, a twin-seat D-model and a single-seat C, were built in the United States and flight-tested in 1996, delivered in December 1996and 1998respectively. Thirty-two production kits were shipped to Switzerland for assembly, with the first in service in January 1997and the final aircraft delivered in December 1999. One crashed during workups, leaving 28C's and 5Ds assigned to three squadrons. Seven instructor pilots were trained at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, and the United States Navy also provided two instructors on exchange to train Hornet pilots.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Hill {{founded the}} Refugee Project, a {{non-profit}} outreach organization <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> transform {{the attitudes and}} behavior of at-risk urban youth. Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange. Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members.|$|E

The study found that 85% of all children residing in Baghdad had watched it and that they interacted with and were attached to many of its characters, who exposed viewers to the accents of the region. The most popular segments were those that contained cartoons, songs, and puppets.

5|$|Molotov's {{position}} {{became increasingly}} tenuous after February 1956, when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats {{of the early}} years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and his purges of the Red Army command structure. As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played {{a leading role in the}} purges, it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> overthrow Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May 2006, HM Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands conferred two honours on the Polish {{forces who}} fought at the battle.

While the party was registered with Elections BC as a provincial party, it also participated in the 2008 federal election, the 2008 municipal election, {{as well as the}} 2009 provincial election. The party sought to promote multiculturalism, advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access, security, health care, education and overall rights and status. It was an advocacy party <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{retirement}} to personal business at Mount Vernon was short-lived. He made an exploratory {{trip to the}} western frontier in 1784 and inspected his land holdings in Western Pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the French and Indian War. There he confronted squatters, including David Reed and the Covenanters; they vacated, but only after losing a court decision heard in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1786. He also facilitated {{the creation of the}} Potomac Company, a public–private partnership <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> link the Potomac River with the Ohio River, but technical and financial challenges rendered the company unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling <b>that</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E
