40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. <b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. <b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions.

40|$|Adequate sealing in {{turbomachinery}} reduces secondary leakage {{and results}} in more efficient and stable systems. Labyrinth seals are most common, although <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> are popular in specialized applications. The Hybrid <b>Brush</b> <b>Seal</b> (HBS) is a novel design that adds to the bristle brush matrix a number of cantilever pads that rest on the rotor surface. Upon shaft rotation the pads lift due to the generation of a hydrodynamic gas film while the <b>brushes</b> effectively <b>seal</b> an upstream pressure. Hence the HBS has no wear and no local thermal distortion effects. Measurements of leakage versus pressure differential are obtained in a three-teeth labyrinth, a conventional <b>brush</b> <b>seal,</b> and a hybrid <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> for operation at high temperature (300 ?C), with shaft surface speeds to 27 m/s, and at supply pressures to 3. 5 bar. Flow measurements are presented {{in terms of a}} flow factor to remove dependency on the air temperature and supply pressure. The measurements demonstrate the HBS leaks less (~ 61 %) than a standard <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and is significantly better (~ 38 %) than a similarly sized labyrinth seal. Predictions of flow through a labyrinth seal predict well at supply pressures under 1. 7 bar but overpredict by as much as 25 % at high supply pressures. A porous medium fluid flow model predicts the flow through the HBS and <b>brush</b> <b>seal.</b> The model for the HBS and <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> underpredicts the flow rate at low supply pressures but match well at high supply pressures. Measurements of the drag torque of the test seals show the HBS has a larger torque when pressurized compared to the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and labyrinth seal. This indicates that the HBS experiences a larger degree of blow-down due to the pads decreasing the clearance. The mechanical parameters of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and HBS are found based upon the flexibility function from impact load tests. A combined structural and dry friction damping model represent well the measured flexibility. An equivalent damping is found based upon the energy dissipation. Based upon the damping ratio, the HBS has twice of the viscous damping as the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> at a supply pressure of 2. 0 bar...|$|R

40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>seals</b> {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company seal test program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester that slides a single tuft of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> wire against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale seal tests. Previous {{to the development of the}} <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale seal tests conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed witness marks. In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded chrome carbide. The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These tests corroborated full-scale seal test results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> materials combinations must be considered. Future <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft testing will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings. The ultimate goal of this work is to expand the current data base so that seal designers can tailor <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> materials to specific applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>seals</b> have {{established}} a niche in the gas-to-gas sealing against leakage in modern turbine engines. The variable nature of the brush during operation makes leakage prediction difficult.

The work, performed by the ULB in collaboration with French engine manufacturer Safran Aircraft Engines, provides first, a description of the test installation that reproduces accurately the severe working conditions encountered in a bearing chamber. A total of eight samples were submitted to extensive testing, and allowed to perform a qualitative analysis of the main performance indicators of a brush seal: the leakage flow, and the seal torque. Complex phenomena acting on the bristle pack were put in evidence under the effect of differential pressure androtation speed, and oil, which fundamentally deteriorate the leakage performance of a <b>brush</b> <b>seal.</b> Subsequently, performance models were developed through empirical correlations, based on the experimental data. They predict the leakage flow and the seal torque {{as a function of the}} geometrical parameters and operating conditions. In addition, hysteresis issues were also addressed, and an IR camera helped investigating the heat generation properties of a <b>brush</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> samples were submitted to endurance testing, in order to highlight wear mechanisms, and study the performance degradation with the operating time. Oil plays a major part in extending <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> operating life, despite the leakage performance degradation. Finally, the correlations developed throughout the PhD thesis were used to develop an optimization process in function of the operating conditions of a modern aero-engine. Ultimately, large savings in air consumption were put in evidence when replacing labyrinth <b>seals</b> by <b>brush</b> <b>seals.</b> Doctorat en Sciences de l'ingénieur et technologieinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{visualize}} and characterize the complex flow fields in simulated <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> is presented. The <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> configuration was {{tested in a}} water and then in an oil tunnel. The visualization procedure revealed typical regions that are rivering, jetting, vortical or lateral flows and exist upstream, downstream or within the seal. Such flows are engendered by variations in fiber void that are spatial and temporal and affect changes in seal leakage and stability. While the effects of interface motion for linear or cylindrical configurations have not been considered herein, {{it is believed that}} the observed flow fields characterize flow phenomenology in both circular and linear <b>brush</b> <b>seals.</b> The axial pressure profiles upstream, across and downstream of the brush in the oil tunnel have been measured under a variety of inlet pressure conditions and the ensuing pressure maps are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> {{is considered to be}} most promising among the advanced type seals that are presently in use in the high speed turbomachinery. The brush is usually mounted on the stationary portions of the engine and has direct contact with the rotating element, in the process of limiting the 'unwanted' leakage flows between stages, or various engine cavities. This type of sealing technology is providing high (in comparison with conventional seals) pressure drops due mainly to the high packing density (around 100 bristles/sq mm), and brush compliance with the rotor motions. In the design of modern aerospace turbomachinery leakage flows between the stages must be minimal, thus contributing to the higher efficiency of the engine. Use of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> instead of the labyrinth seal reduces the leakage flow by one order of magnitude. <b>Brush</b> <b>seals</b> also have been found to enhance dynamic performance, cost less, and are lighter than labyrinth seals. Even though industrial <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> have been successfully developed through extensive experimentation, there is no comprehensive numerical methodology for the design or prediction of their performance. The existing analytical/numerical approaches are based on bulk flow models and do not allow the investigation of the effects of brush morphology (bristle arrangement), or brushes arrangement (number of brushes, spacing between them), on the pressure drops and flow leakage. An increase in the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> efficiency is clearly a complex problem that is closely related to the brush geometry and arrangement, and can be solved most likely only by means of a numerically distributed model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>seals</b> {{have proven}} to be an {{attractive}} alternative to labyrinth seals for turbomachinery applications. This advanced seal technology utilizes both the high temperature capability of special-alloy wire and flexure adaptability of fibers to accommodate a wide range of operating situations. Because the bristles slide against the rotor surface, contact forces generated at the interface of the rotor and fiber tips can lead to eventual bristle fatigue and wear of the seal/rotor system. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable modeling techniques that can help identify complex relationships among <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> design parameters, in-service load and contact forces that arise during operation of turbomachinery. The first portion of the current research is concerned with modeling and evaluating bristle deformation, bending stress and bristle/rotor contact forces that are generated at the interface of the fiber and rotor surface due to interference between the bristle/rotor and radial fluid flow, which is derived from aerodynamic forces termed 2 ̆ 2 blow-down 2 ̆ 2. In plane large displacement mechanics analysis was applied. Contact forces are obtained for a range of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> design parameters including fiber lay angle, flexural rigidity and length. The second portion of this research examines hysteresis, which is a major phenomenon that affects <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> leakage and wear performance. Two mechanics models were developed to examine the hysteresis, namely, the role of distributed inter bristle friction force on hysteresis phenomenon and the bristle/back plate interaction model for assessing the hysteresis phenomenon. Nonlinear beam theory (2 D) and general beam theory (3 D) are applied for solving bristle deformation in the above two mechanics models, respectively. Hysteresis is quantified as the differential work done by friction force during a load cycle, and the consequence of hysteresis [...] 2 ̆ 2 gapping 2 ̆ 2 is explored as well. This systematic analysis of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> system is expected to provide valuable information for the development of new <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> that exhibit improved performance, including reduced bristle/shaft wear, low hysteresis, and reduced leakage between successive stages of the turbine...|$|R
