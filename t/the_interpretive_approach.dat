40|$|This thesis explores {{changes in}} {{approaches}} to {{the interpretation of the}} genre of classical Chinese poetry re-created as English poetry during the twentieth century. This genre, produced by two literary cultures - Chinese and English - is subjected to critical scrutiny in both its original and re-created forms and this study discusses the extent to which critical theories resulted in shifts in <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> of twentieth century translations of <b>the</b> genre. <b>Interpretive</b> changes are exposed by comparative analysis of publications of the genre by Ezra Pound and Arthur Waley, Burton Watson and Gary Snyder, James J. Y. Liu and Stephen Owen and Pauline Yu and Haun Saussy. This involves a discussion of how their formative years, environmental factors and critical pressures influenced their approaches to interpretation of the genre. The study found that changes to interpretative approaches for the genre rested on two key experiences of translators and readers. Primary influences - family, education and personal pursuits - did affect interpreters of the genre but secondary influences - critical theories, literary trends, political, religious and social movements - had greater impact on interpretive change. Isogesis, an unavoidable factor of cultural interpretation, insidiously influenced how the genre was interpreted and that the increased use of montage and anthology late in the twentieth century attempted to reduce the effect of isogesis and, even more importantly, returned the genre to its cultural roots, the Shijing, the earliest Chinese classical anthology of poetry. This study illustrates three areas of importance. Firstly, it shows that biographical and environmental factors affecting translators caused shifts in approach to interpretation of classical Chinese poetry re-created as English poetry. Secondly, choices of what to re-create and print - made by translators, editors and publishers - affect reader response to the genre. Thirdly and finally, it suggests the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> of these eight translators can be employed as poetic montage in the third millennium to reduce the effect of misinterpreting of the genre.

50|$|Normalization process {{theory is}} {{regarded}} as a middle range theory that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to actor-network theory in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because Normalization Process Theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approach</b> of ethnography and other qualitative research methods, it also lends itself to systematic review and survey research methods. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially diffusion of innovations theory, labor process theory, and psychological theories including the theory of planned behavior and social learning theory.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} nature of {{hermeneutic}} philosophy and the assumptions and features of a textual interpretation consistent with this perspective. The relationship of hermeneutic philosophy to <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> and critical theory traditions in consumer research is also discussed. T he term "hermeneutics " and related derivations have appeared with increasing frequency in con-sumer research (App. A). Although these terms have most often appeared in studies taking an "interpretive approach " (Hudson and Ozanne 1988), the relationship of hermeneutics to this approach remains obscure. Moreover, the questions, What is hermeneutics? and Does hermeneutics have a unique contribution to make to consumer research? remain unanswered. This article attempts {{to answer these questions}} and, in the process, follows Hudson and Ozanne by identifying differences among <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches.</b> Hermeneutic philosophy is concerned with the in-terpretation of understanding (Bernstein 1983; Bleicher 1980; Gadamer 1989). This philosophy holds that un-derstanding has an ontological status. It emphasizes that all understanding is linguistic. Furthermore, herme-neutic philosophy explores how the sUbject-object di-chotomy may be bridged by an interpreter engaging the "other " through a reading that is grounded in, but not determined solely by, the interpreter's [pre-]under-standing. The relevance of hermeneutics to consumer research is threefold. First, in purporting to understand under-standing itself, philosophical hermeneutics is basic to any scientific or scholarly endeavor. The concept of [pre-]understanding accounts not only for existing the-ory and research findings but also for the knowledge that researchers as subjects share with the human objects of their inquiry. Second, hermeneutic philosophy refines our under-standing of <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> used in con...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{concepts}} of karma and rebirth {{in the light of}} some key themes from the later work of Wittgenstein. After clarifying what it means to “bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use” it is considered how certain Wittgenstein-influenced philosophers, notably İlham Dilman and D. Z. Phillips, have sought to recover the meaning of “soul” from metaphysical misappropriations by invoking Wittgenstein’s notion of a “picture” The sort of conceptual recovery involved in this task resembles, in some respects, the “demythologizing” and “psychologizing” approaches of certain interpreters of the doctrine of karma and rebirth, especially within the context of Buddhist studies. Illustrative examples of these approaches are compared and contrasted and discussed in relation to instances of individuals articulating their belief in karma and rebirth. On the basis of this discussion, it is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> in question fail to account for the sense of individual responsibility for one’s own present circumstances that is central to how talk of karma and rebirth frequently operates “in the stream of thought and life. ...|$|R

The aim was to evaluate the transferability of <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approach</b> to teachers’ continuing professional development and {{to see how far}} it increased their understanding of and relationship with their local communities. Qualitative data were gathered using a range of methods including participant observation, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The teachers engaged in ethnographic-type activities in their participant observation of groups and interviews with representatives and their students. The principles of <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approach</b> – representation, interpretation and reflexivity – underpinned the design of the programme and the data analysis. The research found that teachers’ understanding of the diversity of communities was increased. There was little evidence of increased understanding of ‘the group’ in relation to individuals and the tradition. There was little formal evidence of a deeper understanding of concepts, of ‘oscillation’ or of personal edification. There were significant professional benefits in increased confidence, dealing with controversial issues and in developing community education. The teachers demonstrated open-mindedness and a positive attitude to pluralism. Further questions about the inter-connectedness of religion and culture and the interpretation of religious texts were raised and there was critical engagement with aspects of community life, including the place of women. The research identifies the need for a more informed critique of and engagement with the presuppositions that underpin discourse on minority communities. The teachers recognised the need for the whole school staff to undergo the same process and understood {{that this would be a}} long-term enterprise.

40|$|The {{abolition}} of riparian entitlements {{in the early}} stages of colonial Australia and the vesting of these rights in the Crown represented a turning point for the evolution of private water rights. The extinguishment of common law rights connected to vested land interests and the introduction of new, unaligned statutory entitlements provided a new and fundamentally different system for the creation and regulation of private water entitlements. Unlike riparian entitlements, in the absence of express definition, statutory water entitlements may only be verified as property where such a construction is consistent with the nature and scope of the entitlement. In this respect, the statutory framework has disaggregated the propertisation of water rights from land ownership and linked the process to broader statutory interpretation principles. The shift away from institutional property has generated concerns about <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> appropriate for <b>the</b> verification of legislative water entitlements. This article examines <b>the</b> existing <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> and argues that the blurring of the propertisation process with the separate issue of whether any change or modification of such water rights attracts s 51 (xxxi) of the Commonwealth Constitution has produced a situation where core property indicia is increasingly overshadowed by legislative defeasibility. In the recent High Court decision of ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Commonwealth, the focus of the majority judgements upon the inherent susceptibility of legislative entitlements to variation or extinguishment acted as a catalyst for the non-propertisation of statutory bore water licences in New South Wales. The emphasis the majority judgements gave to legislative defeasibility precluded a full and balanced assessment of other highly relevant property indicia, in particular the expectation interests of the holders. Conflating property and constitutional evaluation in this way is inappropriate in an era where entitlements to natural resource interests are increasingly statute based and the verification process has significant social and economic repercussions. Determining whether a statutory entitlement constitutes property requires a careful balancing of legislative intent, social and environmental context and individual expectation and the vicissitudes of a regulatory context should not eclipse this process. <br /...|$|R

" Although Fish ultimately rejects <b>the</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> of Saint Augustine and John Milton, his own conception of "faith" is itself drawn from a conflation of Augustinian and Miltonic theological discourse. Fish argues that because all readers (as members of interpretive communities) must always employ some kind of interpretive strategy which actually constitutes their perceptions, {{the notion of an}} objective "fact" or "text" is illusory. Part of the strength in Fish's position derives from structuring each of his arguments {{in such a way that}} all attempts to challenge his specific literary or historical claims only serve to support his more general conclusion that such issues are always debatable. As a result, his arguments consistently end up making claims that are somehow independent of their specific literary or historical content.
