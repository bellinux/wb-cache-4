5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{composite}} light-curve model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbiotic nova PU Vul (Nova Vulpeculae 1979) {{that shows a}} long-lasted flat optical peak followed by a slow decline. Our model light-curve consists of three components of emission, i. e., an outbursting white dwarf (WD), its M-giant companion, and nebulae. The WD component dominates in the flat peak while the nebulae dominate after <b>the</b> photospheric temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WD rises to log T (K) >~ 4. 5, suggesting its WD origin. We analyze the 1980 and 1994 <b>eclipses</b> to be <b>total</b> <b>eclipses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WD occulted by the pulsating M-giant companion with two sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebular emission; one is an unocculted nebula <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-giant's cool-wind origin {{and the other is}} a partially occulted nebula associated to the WD. We confirmed our theoretical outburst model of PU Vul by new observational estimates, that spanned 32 yr, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature and radius. Also our eclipse analysis confirmed that the WD photosphere decreased by two orders <b>of</b> magnitude between <b>the</b> 1980 and 1994 eclipses. We obtain the reddening E(B-V) ~ 0. 3 and distance to PU Vul d ~ 4. 7 kpc.

On this date, the Spanish and their Nahuan allies were battling the local insurgent Otomi and Chichimecas at a hill now known as Sangremal and which was called Ynlotepeque and considered sacred in pre-Hispanic times.

40|$|Giant flares can release {{large amounts}} of energy {{within a few days}} 1 − 7 : X-ray {{emission}} alone can be up to ten percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star’s bolometric luminosity. These flares exceed <b>the</b> luminosities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest solar flares by many orders of magnitude, which suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms supplying the energy are different from those on the Sun. Magnetic coupling between the components in a binary system or between a young star and an accretion disk has been proposed 3, 7 − 9 as a prerequisite for giant flares. Here we report X-ray observations of a giant flare on Algol B, a giant star in an eclipsing binary system.
