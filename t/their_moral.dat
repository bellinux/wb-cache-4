5|$|A {{group of}} sixty-one {{religious}} leaders in Washington, D.C. {{sent a letter}} to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskin's owner Daniel Snyder stating <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.|$|E
5|$|Ælfheah sent Ælfric of Eynsham to Cerne Abbey to {{take charge}} of its monastic school. He was present at the council of May 1008 at which Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, preached his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos (The Sermon of the Wolf to the English), castigating the English for <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.|$|E

5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The Rules of the Game (original French title: La Règle du Jeu) is a 1939 French film {{directed}} by Jean Renoir. It features an ensemble cast of Nora Gregor, Paulette Dubost, Mila Parély, Marcel Dalio, Julien Carette, Roland Toutain, Gaston Modot, Pierre Magnier and Jean Renoir himself. Renoir's {{portrayal of the}} wise, mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this pensive comedy of manners. The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II, showing <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> callousness on the eve of impending destruction.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E

6000|$|... "Physically, they're magnificent; I reckon it's {{the proper}} word. Six feet tall, muscular and hard as rawhide. We don't {{know much about}} <b>their</b> <b>morals,</b> but they're fearless, proud, and {{distrust}} strangers. Anyhow, they're a pretty tough crowd to get up against." ...|$|R
5|$|The Pitch Document {{described}} Avatars as {{sharing the}} ability to envision the past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright and can be improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only Creatures of Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} comprises first-person {{exploration of}} dungeons and battles against demons; the player can also choose {{to speak to}} the demons, and attempt to recruit them to their party. By fusing multiple allied demons together, the player can create more powerful demons. The story is set decades after the first Shin Megami Tensei, in the encapsulated city Tokyo Millennium, which is ruled by the religious Messians from a unit called the Center. The player takes the role of a gladiator who is told that he is the Messiah, and is sent on missions around Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare for the Thousand-Year Kingdom. The plot is influenced by choices the player makes throughout the game, determining <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> alignment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
60|$|I know no modern nation, moreover, which {{illustrates}} so forcibly as China {{the great}} historic law which the Hebrew Prophets proclaim; {{and that is}} this:--That as the prosperity of a nation is the correlative of <b>their</b> <b>morals,</b> so are <b>their</b> <b>morals</b> the correlative of their theology. As a people behaves, so it thrives; as it believes, so it behaves. Such as his Gods are, such will the man be; down to that lowest point which {{too many of the}} Chinese seem to have reached, where, having no Gods, he himself becomes no man; but (as I hear you see him at the Australian diggings) abhorred for his foul crimes even by the scum of Europe.|$|R
50|$|Communication {{ethics is}} the notion that an individual's or group's {{behavior}} are governed by <b>their</b> <b>morals</b> which in turn affects communication. Generally speaking communication ethics deals with the moral good present in any form of human communication. This includes interpersonal communication, mass mediated communication, and digital communication.|$|R

25|$|Given {{that the}} bards {{depended}} on aristocratic support to survive, {{and that this}} power and patronage was shifting towards the new English rulers, this thorough condemnation of <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> values may well have contributed to their demise as a caste.|$|E
50|$|How to Create a Ghetto: Macwilliam, Richard - This poem {{talks about}} the {{ingredients}} so to say on creating a ghetto. Richard gives a recipe with a step by step approach, stating things such as taking away <b>their</b> <b>morals,</b> stirring in low educational goals, and throwing in drugs.

60|$|But {{admitting that}} {{two or three}} of these offend less in <b>their</b> <b>morals</b> than in <b>their</b> writings, must poverty make {{nonsense}} sacred? If so, the fame of bad authors would be much better consulted than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of a hundred had ever been called by his right name.|$|R
25|$|Travellers have a {{distinctive}} approach to religion; {{the vast majority}} are Roman Catholics with particular attention paid to issues of healing.

25|$|Since {{humanity}} possesses free will, {{people must}} be responsible for <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> choices. By using free will, people must {{take an active role}} in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.|$|E
25|$|Founder's Day-The Founder's Day is {{observed}} {{in the month of}} August to pay homage to the late founders who sowed the seeds of education and nurtured it with vision and foresight to enable children to realize their dreams.

60|$|Thy father's Hannah is {{generally}} {{allowed to be}} an exception to all Scottish housekeepers, and stands unparalleled for cleanliness among the women of Auld Reekie; but the cleanliness of Hannah is sluttishness compared to the scrupulous purifications of these people, who seem to carry into the minor decencies of life that conscientious rigour which they affect in <b>their</b> <b>morals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Neverwinter debuted on the New York Times {{bestseller list}} at number 4. A staff {{reviewer}} from enworld.org gave Neverwinter a 4.5 out 5 stating that [...] "Neverwinter {{is filled with}} great intrigue,, and some smart dialogue, particularly between Drizzt and Dahlia, where they test <b>their</b> <b>morals,</b> ethics, and philosophies of life off each other, like duelists looking for a weakness." ...|$|R

25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{hold that}} the soul ceases to exist {{when the person}} dies and {{therefore}} that Hell (Sheol or Hades) {{is a state of}} non-existence. In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection. Tartarus is held to be the metaphorical state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).|$|E
25|$|The Holy Spirit enables Christian life by {{dwelling}} in {{the individual}} believers and enables them to live a righteous and faithful life. He acts as Comforter or Paraclete, one who intercedes, or supports or acts as an advocate, particularly in times of trial. He acts to convince unredeemed persons both of the sinfulness of their actions and thoughts, and of <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> standing as sinners before God. The Holy Spirit both inspired {{the writing of the}} scriptures and now interprets them to the Christian and church.|$|E
25|$|Bahá'í law limits {{permissible}} {{sexual relations}} to those {{between a man}} and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain from sex outside matrimony. Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to impose <b>their</b> <b>moral</b> standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether sexual or otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.|$|E
500|$|Author Timothy Morris {{wrote that}} the plot and themes in Shiloh had many {{parallels}} to the 1940 novel Lassie Come-Home by Eric Knight. In both novels, boys {{fall in love with}} dogs owned by others. The dogs repeatedly return to the children in [...] "mirror imag scenes", while the ethical fathers try to convince them not to betray <b>their</b> <b>morals</b> and fall for the dogs.|$|R
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in the corruption of <b>their</b> <b>morals.</b> The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|R
