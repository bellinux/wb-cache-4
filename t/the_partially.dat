By using {{the results in}} [15] we formulate three dual problems for the optimization problem with convex inequality and affine equality constraints, which includes <b>the</b> convex <b>partially</b> separable one. For these duals we give a constraint qualification which guarantees the existence of strong duality. Optimality conditions for <b>the</b> convex <b>partially</b> separable optimization problem and some particular cases are also obtained...|$|R

5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already been included in <b>the</b> <b>partially</b> constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>partially</b> constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E

40|$|The {{generalized}} {{likelihood ratio}} test (GLRT) for a stochastic partially homogeneous model is proposed for adaptive signal detection. <b>The</b> stochastic <b>partially</b> homogeneous model generalizes <b>the</b> standard <b>partially</b> homogeneous model by treating the disturbance covariance matrix as a random matrix. Specifically, it assumes that, R, the disturbance covariance matrix of training signals, is a random matrix with some a priori information, while R 0, the disturbance covariance matrix {{of the test}} signal, is equal to R, i. e., R 0 = R, where is an unknown scaling factor. The proposed GLRT uses a colored loading of the a priori knowledge and the sample covariance matrix for the adaptive signal detection. Numerical examples show that the GLRT is invariant to scaling factor and outperforms the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE), which is the GLRT for <b>the</b> standard <b>partially</b> homogeneous case, in <b>the</b> stochastic <b>partially</b> homogeneous environment...|$|R

It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is <b>the</b> <b>partially</b> healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on <b>the</b> <b>partially</b> aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
