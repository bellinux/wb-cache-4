40|$|Class of 2009 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore the {{correlations}} between demographics, knowledge, and attitudes that student pharmacists have in regards to oral emergency contraception (OEC) and their dispensing. METHODS: University of Arizona pre-rotation student pharmacists {{were asked to complete}} a questionnaire during a regularly scheduled required class. The questionnaire had three sections consisting of general OEC knowledge, specific attitudes regarding OEC, and demographic data. RESULTS: Students who stated moral and/or ethical objections <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> OEC had significantly lower knowledge scores. They also showed a response pattern to attitude and belief questions opposite to that of students who stated feeling comfortable dispensing OEC in most situations. There {{were no significant differences in}} total correct scores on the knowledge questions between gender or year in school, however, there were significant differences in some specific questions. CONCLUSIONS: Students who did not feel comfortable dispensing OEC or had moral and/or religious objections <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> OEC were found to have lower knowledge scores. With the exception of two knowledge questions, total correct scores on OEC knowledge questions increased with year in school. Lack of knowledge about OEC may in part contribute to unease and objections <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> them...|$|R

After setting up a committee <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

Her opponents for the Democratic nomination included Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane and Grady Stumbo, the former secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources. Collins had the support of many leaders in the Democratic Party, but just before the primary, Governor Brown endorsed Stumbo, charging that both Sloane and Collins would use their gubernatorial appointment power <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> party patronage. Although this was a common practice at the time, Brown notably shunned it during his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination. Sloane asked for a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the outcome and conceded defeat.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential impact}} on appropriateness of discharge medication if discharge prescriptions were reviewed by the ward pharmacist before being dispensed. Method: Over a four-week period discharge prescriptions were reviewed by either the ward pharmacist involved in the patient's care (cases) or a dispensary pharmacist who {{had no knowledge of}} the patient's care (controls). A second review with the availability of patient records was carried out to identify additional queries that should have been raised prior <b>to</b> <b>dispensing.</b> Results: Fifty-five prescriptions (29 case, 26 control) containing 279 items (140 case, 139 control) were reviewed. Forty -four queries (23 case, 21 control) were found on initial checking of the prescription, 12 more queries (1 case, 11 control) were found on the second review of the prescription. There were 13 potentially clinically significant queries in the case group, 12 (92 %) were made during initial prescription review. There were 23 potentially clinically significant queries in the control group, only 12 (52 %) were made on initial prescription review. Changes to the prescription resulting from potentially clinically significant queries prior <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> occurred in 19 (79 %) queries (10 case, 83 %; and 9 control, 75 %). Of queries raised prior <b>to</b> <b>dispensing</b> in the control group, 18 involved contacting hospital staff for resolution where they could have been resolved using the inpatient prescription chart, notes or the patient themselves. This compared to only one in the case group. Conclusion: Review of discharge prescriptions by the ward pharmacist involved in the patient's care optimises the appropriateness of discharge medication and the efficiency of the discharge process.

5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1450s, {{a great deal}} of the {{legislative}} business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Before the sixteenth century, parliamentary business was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including the General Council and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely <b>to</b> <b>dispense</b> with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.|$|E
