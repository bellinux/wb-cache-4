500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make them {{hard to find}} to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials [...] "FC" [...] hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb. One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E

But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E

Besides, have I not <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>it</b> ill becomes {{a child of}} Christ to chatter with those sons of Belial? But canst thou not repeat the words--the WORDS he said?" [...] he continued suspiciously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is wrong to judge," [...] she said, [...] "but do you {{remember}} that Lenten sermon, and the impression I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> made?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, bother that thing!' she answered. 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is {{only one}} of his inventions, and I wish he would put it in his pocket.' ...|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gertrude, {{you have}} no right to use that word. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> was a {{question}} of rational compromise. It is no more than that.|$|E
6000|$|NICHOLLS (as an afterthought). And, honestly, Mr. Carmody, I don't {{see how you}} can object for a second--after he's <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it's</b> {{absolutely}} necessary for Eileen to go away. (Seeing Carmody's shaken condition, he finishes boldly.) You've some feeling for your own daughter, haven't you? You'd be a fine father if you hadn't! ...|$|R
60|$|So I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how <b>it</b> {{came that}} Percival {{went out into}} the world for to become a famous knight.|$|R

6000|$|... "Haven't I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> ain't for sale. Wait till I'm {{dead and}} come and buy it at my auction. No, you won't, though, for it's going somewhere else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sure,' he answered--'just as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> was Dave Duck, all right; {{most of us}} knew him. And now, you damned impostor, you'd better tell me who you are.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And what I {{should never}} have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> were <b>it</b> not my only chance of curing you of this foolish passion. I am an American slave!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he muttered, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how <b>it</b> would be. I don't know, I'm sure--nobody {{tells me}} anything. Are you {{sleeping}} here, my boy?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> wasn't safe to {{stay around}} here," [...] was Merwell's comment. [...] "Why {{not go out}} West with me? It will be much safer there, I am sure." ...|$|E
