40|$|The {{effects of}} 8 day {{continuous}} subcutaneous (s. c.) infusions of growth hormone releasing hormone analogue (NLE 27 GRF(1 - 29) NH 2 (GHRH. A)) on growth hormone (GH) secretion were studied in 14 normal adult male volunteers. GHRH. A was administered in doses which ranged from 7. 5 to 120 ng/kg/min in doubling steps. Baseline GH profiles obtained during a 24 h infusion of normal saline in each subject {{were compared with}} profiles performed on days 1 and 8 of the infusion. Doses above 30 ng/kg/min augmented GH pulse amplitude and frequency. Doses of 60 ng/kg/min and 120 ng/kg/min appeared more satisfactory as these represented doses on the upwards slope of the dose response curve. However, at a dose of 120 ng/kg/min the GH secretion {{did not return to}} baseline for 12 of the 24 h.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of {{urinary incontinence}} due to spaying remains unknown. Incontinent bitches {{can be treated}} successfully <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> <b>preparations</b> of GnRH-analogues and {{there are differences in}} plasma gonadotropin levels between continent and incontinent spayed bitches. It is therefore assumed that the supraordinated hormones, GnRH, FSH, and/or LH, {{have an effect on the}} urodynamic parameters. In this study, the potential influence of these hormones on the lower urinary tract was investigated by measuring urethral pressure profiles and cystometry. Simultaneously, plasma concentrations in 10 spayed Beagle bitches were determined 5 weeks prior to and 8 weeks after <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> the GnRH analogue leuprolide. Within 1 week of GnRH analogue administration, plasma FSH and LH levels decreased from 72. 5 and 7. 7 to 7. 75 and 0. 72 ng/mL, respectively. These plasma gonadotropin levels correspond with those of intact bitches during anoestrus. Urethral pressure profiles indicated that the treatment had no significant effect on maximum urethral closure pressure, functional and total length of the urethra, or area of the closure pressure curve. The data obtained by cystometry regarding mean bladder threshold volume showed a significant increase from 109 to 172 mL. The improvement in bladder function after the application of GnRH-application is presumably a direct effect of the GnRH as a relationship between the plasma gonadotropin levels and the urodynamic parameters could not demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although an {{effective}} treatment for hyper-prolactinaemia, initiation of bromocriptine therapy {{may be associated}} with significant acute side-effects in some patients, particularly nausea, vomiting and postural hypotension. These may be minimized by initial <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> i. m. <b>depot</b> bromocriptine (Parlodel-LAR, Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland), but adverse effects following the first injection may still be a significant problem. Following the observation that cortisol deficient patients were subject to an increased incidence of severe side-effects on initiation of bromocriptine therapy, we have evaluated whether concurrent administration of oral prednisolone to patients without cortisol deficiency might reduce adverse effects. DESIGN: Double-blind placebo-controlled trial with prednisolone (20 mg) prior to, and 16 hours after, depot injection of i. m. bromocriptine (50 or 100 mg). PATIENTS: Twenty-one consecutive patients with hyperprolactinaemia (serum prolactin > 1000 mU/l on 3 separate occasions) who were due to start depot bromocriptine and who had a normal cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. MEASUREMENTS: Symptoms at 0, 16 and 40 hours after injection were assessed using visual linear analogue scales and both inter and intra-group scores were compared by non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Depot bromocriptine was associated with the significant occurrence of light-headedness and lethargy in the placebo-administered group by 16 hours, and also with nausea and nasal congestion by 40 hours. These symptoms did not occur in the prednisolone-administered group. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent oral administration of prednisolone significantly reduces the incidence of acute adverse effects following depot bromocriptine. Two 20 mg doses of prednisolone given at 12 -hour intervals may be used to avoid dopamine-agonist-induced adverse effects at the initiation of <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> bromocriptine, and may also be of value in the treatment of side-effects associated with other dopamine agonist drugs...|$|R

It is characterized by distinctive clinical features including {{a change in}} mental status, generalized rigidity, hyperpyrexia, and dysautonomia. It can be lethal if not diagnosed and treated properly. Mortality and morbidity attributed to this syndrome have recently declined markedly due to greater awareness, earlier diagnosis, and intensive care intervention. In most cases, the syndrome {{occurs as a result}} of a rapid increase in a dose of neuroleptic, especially one of the long-acting ones. Pathophysiology behind this syndrome is attributed to a dopamine receptor blockade inside the neurons rendered by the offending drug and excessive calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal myocytes. Laboratory tests, although not diagnostic, may assist in assessing the severity of the syndrome and also the consequent complications. The syndrome has been described in all age groups and occurs more in males than in females. Genetics appears to be central regarding the etiology of the syndrome. Stopping the use of the offending agent, cold intravenous fluids, and removal of the causative agent and its possible active metabolites is the cornerstone of treatment. Periodic observation of psychotic patients recently started on antipsychotic medications, especially those being treated <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> <b>preparations,</b> may aid to an early diagnosis of the syndrome and lead to early treatment.

Growth hormone excess in acromegaly can be controlled in many patients by pharmacotherapy alone, and {{with a combination of}} transsphenoidal surgery and pharmacotherapy in almost all patients. Since the clinical introduction of pegvisomant, a growth hormone-receptor antagonist, the role of radiotherapy is restricted. This review focuses on the treatment options for acromegaly (e. g., surgery, radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy <b>with</b> the <b>depot</b> <b>preparations</b> of the somatostatin analogues octreotide long-acting release formulation, lanreotide slow-release formulation and lanreotide Autogel, the growth hormone antagonist pegvisomant and the dopamine agonist cabergoline).

The evidence for biochemical goals aimed at during medical treatment and the costs of pharmacotherapy are discussed. A new treatment algorithm is proposed, in which the choice between primary medical treatment and primary surgery is individualised, dependent on adenoma size and extension, patient factors (age, preference for therapy, contraindication for surgery), surgical experience of the centre and octreotide sensitivity of the adenoma.

40|$|Long {{protocol}} of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-analougue (GnRH-a) {{can result}} {{in the formation of}} ovarian cyst by the transient initial stimulatory effect which increases the levels of both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These cysts require surgical drainage or result in poor ovarian response. Ovarian cyst formation can be prevented by taking oral contraceptives (OCs) which suppress LH and FSH after initiation of GnRH-a therapy. This study was designed to investigate ovarian cyst formation during therapy <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> formulation of GnRH-a and also the effect of taking (OCs) before starting the <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> formulation of GnRH-a, on the formation of ovarian cyst, implantation and pregnancy rate in assisted reproductive tecnique (ART) cycles. Fifty four infertile women who were candidate for ART, underwent two treatment protocols in a prospective randomized trial: (a) OC+HMG+diphereline and (b) HMG+diphereline. In group (a) patients were pretreated with OC for 14 days starting from the first day of mensturation and on the day 14 received 3. 75 mg IM depot diphereline. Patients in group (b) received 3. 75 mg diphereline by intramuscular injection {{on the second day of}} menstruation. Sonography was performed on the first day of menstruation and also 7 and 14 days after diphereline injection. Ovarian cyst incidence, gonadotropin consumption, follicular growth, implantation rate and pregnancy in the two groups were studied. No ovarian cyst with diameter over 26 mm was developed <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> formulation of GnRH-a in any of the two groups (a and b). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the follicular growth (9. 2 ± 2. 1 and 9. 4 ± 2. 9), number of oocyte (5. 0 ± 2. 8 and 5. 4 ± 5. 7), implantation rate (0. 02 ± 0. 08 and 0. 03 ± 0. 10) and pregnancy rate (0. 09 and 0. 11).

Patients and methods: Using a large United States commercial claims and encounters database, patients younger than 65 years diagnosed with schizophrenia were identified. Patients initiated on a depot antipsychotic were studied in a mirror-image design to assess change in hospitalization rates, mean duration hospitalized, and hospitalization cost. McNemar&rsquo;s test and paired t-tests compared the proportions of patients hospitalized and the mean duration. Paired t-test and bootstrapping methods compared costs. Results: In these patients (n = 147), psychiatric hospitalizations declined from 49. 7 % pre-initiation to 22. 4 % post-initiation (P &lt; 0. 001), and the mean hospitalized duration for psychiatric purposes numerically declined from 7. 3 to 4. 7 days (P = 0. 05).

40|$|Objective and design: The aim of {{the study}} was the {{retrospective}} evaluation of pregnancy in acromegalic women attending our center. Patients and methods: Six active acromegalic women (30 – 35 -years old, disease duration 5 – 17 years) underwent seven pregnancies. Four patients had macroadenoma and two microadenoma; four had surgery; and two had been treated primarily with drugs. Before conception, GH and IGF-I were 5. 4 G 0. 8 and 430 G 58 mg/l respectively. GH (by an assay unable to distinguish pituitary hormone from placental variant), IGF-I, and prolactin (PRL) levels were assessed before conception, every 3 months, and after delivery; visual field and magnetic resonance imaging were performed before delivery in the only patient with macroadenoma not previously operated on and after delivery in all. Results: All the women conceived normally, after discontinuation of medications in five cases and, while on <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> somatostatin analogs in two (discontinued after confirmation of pregnancy). All patients remained off-treatment throughout pregnancy, had uneventful pregnancies, and term delivery. The babies were healthy and normal in length and weight. Breast-feeding was allowed in four cases. During pregnancy, GH levels showed variable changes; IGF-I, notwithstanding the withdrawal of any GH hypersecretion-suppressive treatment, remained close to normal limits in all subjects and returned to pathological levels after delivery; PRL increased physiologically, returning to baseline level after delivery. In one of the two patients primarily treated with drugs, GH levels increased and the tumor regrew throughout pregnancy, although without visual impairment. Conclusions: Pregnancy in acromegalic women has a normal course leading to a normal delivery, and produces normal babies. GH levels show variable changes, but decrease in most patients.

Antipsychotic monotherapy was prescribed for 89. 2 % patients, whereas polytherapy with two- and three-drugs in 10. 4 and 0. 4 %, respectively. Atypical antipsychotics were prescribed more often (67. 7 %) than typical antipsychotics. Risperidone and haloperidol were the most frequently prescribed antipsychotics. Long-acting risperidone injection was the only <b>depot</b> <b>preparation</b> prescribed. The mean antipsychotic dose expressed as chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZeq; mg/day) was 242 (220 for monotherapy and 414 for polytherapy). The prevalence of high dose antipsychotic (mean CPZeq > 1000 mg/day) was 1. 8 %, prescribed at a mean CPZeq dose of 1531 (1925 for monotherapy and 1137 for polytherapy), mainly attributed to haloperidol. Anticholinergics were co-prescribed for almost two third of patients receiving antipsychotics, particularly for those on polytherapy (monotherapy 57. 3 %; poly-therapy 87. 5 %). Antipsychotic polytherapy, high dose and co-prescription of an oral <b>with</b> a <b>depot</b> antipsychotic <b>preparation</b> were strongly associated with concurrent prescription of anticholinergics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a 12 - to 24 -month <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> long-acting {{octreotide}} (OCT-LAR) on hormone profile, tumor mass, and clinical symptoms were reported in 36 patients with active acromegaly [GH, 34. 2 +/- 5. 6 microg/L; insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), 784. 5 +/- 40. 4 microg/L]. Fifteen patients were de novo whereas 21 had previously undergone unsuccessful surgery. Serum GH (P < 0. 0001) and IGF-I levels (P < 0. 0001) significantly decreased as early as after the first injection of OCT-LAR and progressively declined during the 12 - 24 months of treatment both in de novo and in operated patients. At the last follow-up, GH hypersecretion was controlled (< or = 2. 5 microg/L) in 69. 4 % whereas normal IGF-I levels were achieved in 61. 1 % of patients. GH and IGF-I suppression during OCT-LAR treatment was similar in de novo and operated patients as shown by nadir GH (2. 3 +/- 0. 6 vs. 2. 2 +/- 0. 6 microg/L) and IGF-I (323. 1 +/- 34. 9 vs. 275. 5 +/- 33. 0 microg/L), percent suppression of GH (92. 7 +/- 2. 0 vs. 85. 9 +/- 3. 3 %) and IGF-I (57. 4 +/- 4. 9 vs. 61. 5 +/- 4. 6 %), and prevalence of GH (73. 3 vs. 76. 2 %) and IGF-I (53. 3 vs. 71. 4 %) control. A decrease in tumor volume was observed in 12 of 15 de novo patients, whereas no shrinkage was detected in 4 of 9 operated patients. No patient had tumor reexpansion during OCT-LAR treatment. Significant clinical improvement was obtained in all patients; heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased in the entire population. A mild but significant increase of blood glucose levels, followed by a decrease of serum insulin levels, was observed after 3 months of treatment: this effect subsided <b>with</b> <b>treatment</b> continuation.

40|$|CONTEXT: Primary <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> {{octreotide}} and lanreotide induces tumor shrinkage in {{newly diagnosed}} patients with acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate clinical predictors of tumor shrinkage. DESIGN: This was an analytical, observational, open, prospective study. SUBJECTS: The study included 99 patients: 13 with microadenoma and 86 with macroadenoma (25 enclosed, 32 extrasellar, 29 invasive). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, gender, estimated disease duration, body mass index, GH and IGF-I levels, and tumor volume at diagnosis and after 12 months of treatment were measured. Percentage of GH, IGF-I, and tumor size changes from baseline were also analyzed. Tumor changes were scored as absent (+/- 0 - 25 %), mild (+/- 25. 1 - 50 %), moderate (+/- 50. 1 - 75 %), or notable (75 %). INTERVENTIONS: Sixty patients (60. 6 %) received depot octreotide im (20 - 30 mg every 28 d), and 39 patients (39. 4 %) received lanreotide im (60 - 90 mg every 28 d). RESULTS: Basal tumor volume and maximal tumor diameter correlated with age, disease duration, and GH levels. After 12 months, GH levels were controlled (</= 2. 5 microg/liter) in 57. 6 %, IGF-I levels in 45. 5 %, and both in 42. 4 %. Shrinkage was absent in 22 patients (22. 2 %), mild in 31 (31. 1 %), moderate in 30 (30. 3 %), and notable in 14 patients (14. 1 %). Two patients (not responding to treatment) had a mild tumor increase (by 34 and 31. 2 %, respectively). Basal and posttreatment tumor volumes were highly correlated (r = 0. 79, P < 0. 0001). At the multistep regression analysis, the percent IGF-I decrease (t = 2. 6; P = 0. 011) was the best predictor of posttreatment tumor volume, followed by patients' age (t = 2. 1; P = 0. 042) and percent GH decrease (t = 2. 0; P = 0. 044). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with acromegaly (75. 5 %) had 25 % or greater tumor shrinkage after 12 months of primary somatostatin analog therapy: significant increase of tumor mass occurred in only 2. 1 % of patients (uncontrolled during treatment).

40|$|Objective Cyclophosphamide (CYC) {{therapy for}} {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease predominantly affecting women of childbearing age, causes an unacceptably high incidence of irreversible premature ovarian failure (POF). This study was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of depot leuprolide acetate, a synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRH-a), for protection against POF during CYC therapy. Methods Young women with severe SLE treated in a standardized protocol of monthly intravenous bolus CYC were offered <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> GnRH-a (<b>depot</b> leuprolide acetate; a 3. 75 -mg monthly injection during the standard CYC regimen). Patients treated with GnRH-a were compared with controls individually matched by age (± 5 years) and by cumulative CYC dose (± 5 gm). Reproductive status was determined after a minimum followup of 3 years after CYC therapy. The primary outcome was time to POF. Paired summary statistical analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess differences in outcome between groups. Results POF developed in 1 of 20 women treated with GnRH-a (5 %) compared with 6 of 20 controls (30 %) matched by age and cumulative CYC dose (matched odds ratio 0. 09, P < 0. 05). Kaplan-Meier estimates demonstrated improved cumulative ovarian protection over time in the GnRH-a–treated group (P = 0. 04). Conclusion <b>Treatment</b> <b>with</b> GnRH-a during CYC therapy was associated with a significant reduction of POF in young women with severe SLE...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis involved four studies of the variability in plasma concentrations and effects of a selection of drugs used in schizophrenia, cardiac surgery and palliative care. 1. Fluphenazine study Steady-state pre-dose plasma concentrations of fluphenazine were measured using a gas chromatography I mass spectrometry assay in 24 patients with schizophrenia who were receiving continuous <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> intramuscular fluphenazine decanoate. Clinical response was measured using the Andreasen Scale for positive and negative symptoms. Poorer clinical control was related to higher log transformed plasma concentrations of fluphenazine and higher fluphenazine decanoate dosage. The log transformed plasma concentrations of fluphenazine and the fluphenazine decanoate dosages were weakly related. These results indicated the useful role that plasma level monitoring can fulfill in identifying patients who are therapy-resistant despite optimal or high plasma levels. 2. CPB study This study examined the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery on the total and unbound plasma concentrations of fentanyl and the total plasma concentrations of alcuronium in sixteen patients. Due to {{the large number of}} factors which may affect pharmacokinetics during CPB, the results were difficult to deal with mathematically. Despite marked declines in the plasma concentrations of both drugs on initiation of CPB, suitable plasma concentrations for anaesthesia were maintained throughout the procedure. 3. Subcutaneous fentanyl This study investigated the steady-state total and unbound plasma concentrations of fentanyl during continuous subcutaneous administration in 20 palliative care patients. Infusion rates and both total and unbound plasma concentrations of fentanyl were correlated. Even with standardisation for dosage, there was an 8 -fold variation in total plasma concentrations and a 3. 5 -fold variation in unbound plasma concentrations of fentanyl. There was considerable inter-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl with subcutaneous infusion in the palliative care setting, which necessitated careful titration of dosage according to individual clinical response. 4. Nebulised morphine trial The final study involved a trial of nebulised morphine for dyspnoea in eleven palliative care patients. Due to patient attrition and the resulting small sample size, a significant improvement in respiratory function and assessment of dyspnoea could not be found overall. Individual patients, however, reported an improvement in their symptoms. More studies with increased numbers are needed to statistically prove the benefit of nebulised morphine over saline alone for the relief of dyspnoea...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on clinical presentation and treatment strategy in patients with GH-secreting adenomas with onset in adolescence. OBJECTIVE: To report results of diagnosis and <b>treatment</b> in adolescents <b>with</b> GH and IGF-I excess. DESIGN: Analytical, observational, retrospective. SUBJECTS: Thirteen patients (five females and eight males, age 15 - 20 years) all with macroadenoma (two extrasellar, 11 invasive). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Height, body mass index (BMI), GH and IGF-I levels, tumour volume at diagnosis and after treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Transsphenoidal surgery, octreotide subcutaneous (OCT, 0. 3 - 0. 8 mg/day), octreotide-LAR i. m. (LAR, 20 - 30 mg/q 28 days), lanreotide i. m. (LAN, 60 - 90 mg/q 28 days), bromocriptine (BRC, 5 mg/day), cabergoline (CAB, 1 - 2 mg/week). RESULTS: Concomitant hyperprolactinaemia was found in eight patients (61. 5 %). All girls presented with amenorrhoea, which was associated with galactorrhoea in two patients; all boys presented with symptoms of tumour mass compression such as visual disturbance or headache; two girls also had these symptoms. Height at diagnosis was above the 97 th centile in four of five girls and in six of eight boys. None of the patients had altered lipid profile while homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 2. 8 +/- 0. 9) and beta-cell function (HOMA-beta, 207. 6 +/- 98. 1 %) were higher than predicted (1 % and 100 %, respectively). First-line treatment was surgery in two patients and somatostatin analogues associated with dopaminergic drugs in 11 patients. None of the patients operated on were cured while six of 11 patients receiving pharmacotherapy (6 - 24 months) were controlled. In these six, tumour volume was reduced by 51. 0 +/- 25. 2 % (median 51. 5 %). As second-line treatment, all the 11 patients treated with somatostatin analogues underwent surgical removal of their tumours. Surgery was successful in four patients and second-line pharmacotherapy in six patients. One patient was lost at follow-up and two patients maintained active acromegaly despite different treatment schedules; both patients were then treated with radiotherapy. At the last follow-up, {{there was a significant}} decrease in insulin levels, HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta without any change in lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of GH-secreting adenomas in adolescent girls is associated with menstrual disturbances and in boys with symptoms of mass effects; tall stature is characteristic in both. First-line <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> somatostatin analogues followed by surgery and then by a second course of somatostatin analogues was successful and safe in 11 of 13 patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effects and {{cost-effectiveness}} of haloperidol, risperidone and placebo on aggressive challenging behaviour in adults with intellectual disability. Design: A double-blind {{randomised controlled trial}} of two drugs and placebo administered in flexible dosage, with full, independent assessments of aggressive and aberrant behaviour, global improvement, carer burden, {{quality of life and}} adverse drug effects at baseline, 4, 12 and 26 weeks, and comparison of total care costs in the 6 months before and after randomisation. At 12 weeks, patients were given the option of leaving the trial or continuing until 26 weeks. Assessments of observed aggression were also carried out with key workers at weekly intervals throughout the trial. Setting: Patients were recruited from all those being treated by intellectual disability services in eight sites in England, one in Wales and one in Queensland, Australia. Participants: Patients from all severity levels of intellectual disability; recruitment was extended to include those who may have been treated with neuroleptic drugs in the past. Exclusion criteria: <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>depot</b> neuroleptics/another form of injected neuroleptic medication within the last 3 months; continuous oral neuroleptic medication within the last week; those under a section of the Mental Health Act 1983 or Queensland Mental Health Act 2000. Interventions: Randomisation to <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> haloperidol (a typical neuroleptic drug), risperidone (an atypical neuroleptic drug) or placebo using a permuted blocks procedure. Dosages were: haloperidol 1. 25 – 5. 0 mg daily; risperidone 0. 5 – 2. 0 mg daily. Main outcome measures: Primary: reduction in aggressive episodes between baseline and 4 weeks using Modified Overt Aggression Scale. Secondary: Aberrant Behaviour Checklist; Uplift/Burden Scale; 40 -item Quality of Life Questionnaire; Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser scale; Clinical Global Impressions scale. Economic costs recorded using a modified version of Client Service Receipt Inventory for 6 months before and after randomisation. Results: There were considerable difficulties in recruitment because of ethical and consent doubts. Twenty-two clinicians recruited a total of 86 patients. Mean daily dosages were 1. 07 mg rising to 1. 78 mg for risperidone and 2. 54 mg rising to 2. 94 mg for haloperidol. Aggression declined dramatically <b>with</b> all three <b>treatments</b> by 4 weeks, with placebo showing the greatest reduction (79 %, versus 57 % for combined drugs) (p = 0. 06). Placebo-treated patients showed no evidence of inferior response in comparison to patients receiving neuroleptic drugs. An additional study found that clinicians who had not participated in clinical trials before were less likely to recruit. Mean total cost of accommodation, services, informal care and treatment over the 6 months of the trial was £ 16, 336 for placebo, £ 17, 626 for haloperidol and £ 18, 954 for risperidone. Conclusions: There were no significant important benefits conferred by <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> risperidone or haloperidol, and <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> these drugs was not cost-effective. While neuroleptic drugs may be of value in the treatment of aggressive behaviour in some patients with intellectual disability, the underlying pathology needs to be evaluated before these are given. The specific diagnostic indications for such treatment require further investigation. Prescription of low doses of neuroleptic drugs in intellectual disability on the grounds of greater responsiveness and greater liability to adverse effects also needs to be re-examined.

The aim of the presented studies was to establish whether lanreotide depot, administered to patients with acromegaly at an extended dosing interval of 6 or 8 weeks, is effective in maintaining appropriate serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) levels, with acceptable tolerability. Methods: Two studies were conducted. Study B 1 compared lanreotide depot 120 mg (every 4, 6, or 8 weeks) with lanreotide microparticle formulation 30 mg (every 7, 10, or 14 days) in 98 patients who had a GH level of &le; 2. 5 ng/mL and normalized IGF- 1. Study B 2 evaluated lanreotide depot 120 mg administered to 64 patients every 8 weeks, after which the dosing interval was adjusted based on GH levels. Results: Mean lanreotide trough serum concentrations at steady state for all dosing intervals were &gt; 1. 13 ng/mL, shown to achieve a GH level of &le; 2. 5 ng/mL. In Study B 1, following <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> lanreotide <b>depot</b> given every 6 or 8 weeks, 87. 5 % and 93. 9 % of patients, respectively, had normalized GH, whereas 83. 3 % and 88. 5 % of patients, respectively, had both normalized GH and IGF- 1. In Study B 2, 88. 9 % had normalized GH and 42. 9 % of patients had normalized GH and IGF- 1 following lanreotide depot every 8 weeks. Gastrointestinal disorders, generally mild/moderate in severity, were the most common adverse events. Conclusion: In the studies presented, lanreotide depot 120 mg every 4, 6, or 8 weeks provided effective hormonal control with acceptable safety. An extended dosing interval is a feasible approach for patients adequately controlled <b>with</b> lanreotide <b>depot</b> 60 or 90 mg every 4 weeks.
