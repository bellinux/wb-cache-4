5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics are {{the same for all}} observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana Senate, was {{directed}} to ascertain {{the legal status of}} the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{rejected}} Vermont's argument <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{was only}} a commercial regulation and not a regulation of speech on <b>the</b> grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> imposed more than an incidental burden on speech.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primary concern}} was to {{maintain}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> {{should continue to}} be used by Christians after they had been regenerated by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to counter the doctrine of Johannes Agricola, who taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> was no longer needed by regenerate Christians."

5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics {{are the same}} in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The next event {{reported}} by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is dated to 906. This records that:King Constantine and Bishop Cellach met at the Hill of Belief near the royal city of Scone and pledged themselves <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> and disciplines of the faith, {{and the laws of}} churches and gospels, should be kept pariter cum Scottis. The meaning of this entry, and its significance, {{have been the subject of}} debate.|$|E
50|$|Wing appealed, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{was outside}} <b>the</b> power of <b>the</b> {{province}} as <b>laws</b> related to morality were considered criminal matters {{which is the}} exclusive authority of the federal government. As well, he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{did not intend to}} include naturalized citizens.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was valid; thus, the Commonwealth {{was able}} to get around the {{restrictions}} in section 51(xxxi) by ensuring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> could not be characterised as land acquisition. Hence, section 51(xxxi) does not restrict the section 96 grants power.|$|R
5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|Tilley's first acts were {{to impose}} a duty on imports to the territory, ban the sale of alcohol to the local {{population}} (but not Americans), and forbid the sale of Samoan lands to non-Samoans. On May 1, 1900, he proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of the United States were in force in the territory, but that Samoan laws that did not conflict with U.S. law would remain in effect. He partitioned the territory into three districts, along the historical divisions implicitly acknowledged in the deed of cession: the two governments on Tutuila and the third comprising the islands of Manu'a, which still did not regard themselves {{as part of the}} territory. Over the next year, Tilley regulated firearms, enforced mandatory registrations of births, deaths, and marriages, levied taxes, and made the sabbath a public holiday. He created a small militia of native Samoans called the Fita Fita Guard for defense and police. The native volunteers in this force were trained at the naval station by a sergeant of the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
50|$|Sticking {{to what he}} believed, {{and despite}} the ongoing support for <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> President Yeltsin vetoed <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on March 18, 1997. Making his {{position}} clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.|$|R
5000|$|To say, for example, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is {{to serve}} God means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is {{dependent}} on interest in God. This cannot {{be the basis for}} any universal moral <b>law.</b> To say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is to seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number or the greatest good, always presupposes some interest in the greatest happiness, the greatest number, the greatest good, and so on. Kant concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source of the nomological character of <b>the</b> moral <b>law</b> must derive not from its content but from its form alone. The content of <b>the</b> universal moral <b>law,</b> <b>the</b> categorical imperative, must be nothing over and above <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> form, otherwise it will be dependent on <b>the</b> desires <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> possessor has. <b>The</b> only <b>law</b> whose content consists in its form, according to Kant, is the statement: [...] Act in such a way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maxim of your will could always hold {{at the same time as}} a principle of a universal legislation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Raz’s ‘normal {{justification}} thesis’ fails {{to explain how}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> can meaningfully claim arbitrative authority. Given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law’s</b> claim to authority is usually understood to amount to (or at least to include) a claim to arbitrative authority, this result suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law’s</b> claim to authority {{will have to be}} justified in ways not captured by the normal justification thesis. If one rejects alternative means of justification not captured by the normal justification thesis, on the other hand, one should likewise abandon <b>the</b> thesis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> necessarily claims practical authority...|$|R

25|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, general covariance is the invariance of {{the form}} of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations. The essential idea is that coordinates are only artifices used in describing nature, and hence should play {{no role in the}} formulation of fundamental physical laws. A more significant requirement is the principle of general relativity that states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics take the same form in all reference systems. This is a generalization of the principle of special relativity which states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically speaking, {{conservation}} of energy can be rigorously proven by the Noether theorem {{as a consequence of}} continuous time translation symmetry; that is, from the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of physics do not change over time.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Toal concurred in the {{judgment}} but argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was unconstitutional (though the defendants' conduct would have excluded them from challenging <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> constitutionality in good faith), and urged the South Carolina General Assembly to modernize the state's gambling statutes.

5000|$|John Weeks {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of value {{is unique to}} an economy based on the {{capitalist}} mode of production. He rejects the claim by Engels <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of value {{is associated with the}} entire history of economic exchange (trade), and modified when the vast majority of inputs and outputs of production have become marketed, priced commodities. Marx himself said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of value [...] "develops fully only on the foundation of capitalist production", implying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of value already asserted itself before capitalist production, although not fully. Indeed, in a criticism of Adam Smith, Marx specifically refers to <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of value governing [...] "simple commodity exchange"—the point being that this law is transformed in capitalist exchange where [...] "more labour is exchanged for less labour (from the labourer’s standpoint), less labour is exchanged for more labour (from the capitalist’s standpoint)".|$|R
50|$|The Third Circuit Court upheld his {{convictions}} 2-1. Authoring a notable dissenting opinion was from then-Judge Samuel Alito. Alito argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> under which Rybar {{had been convicted}} should be vacated, because Congress, in its lawmaking, had not made sufficient findings regarding the impact on interstate commerce clause to fully justify the court deferring to Congressional judgement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was authorized by the Commerce Clause. Rather than actually ruling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was unconstitutional, Alito asserted simply that Congress had not sufficiently justified it, allowing that, had Congress made sufficient findings, he would defer to those findings.|$|R
