5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{intends to}} show {{a model of a}} {{monolithic}} reactor for the autothermal reforming process (ATR). This process uses hydrocarbons (fossil fuels or biofuels) to produce H 2. The ATR chemical reactions take place on the surface of monolith channels coated with a catalyst. The isothermal ATR reactor is modeled using 42 catalytic surface chemical reactions that involve 13 solid species and 7 gas species. To solve the model, two numerical techniques are compared: the Surface Model using weak form equations (SM) and a standard thin Volume Model (VM). This paper shows that the surface modeling (SM) is the better way to calculate the monolith catalytic reactions. Because this simulator is a preliminary version not yet experimentally validated, and in order to verify the simulator result consistency, results are compared with <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibriums</b> calculated by COMSOL. The conclusions are that the results given by the dynamic simulator are in agreement with the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibriums...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E

25|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is that this <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> should be a KMS state.

25|$|Planck's law {{describes}} the unique and characteristic spectral distribution for electromagnetic radiation in <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> {{when there is}} no net flow of matter or energy. Its physics is most easily understood by considering the radiation in a cavity with rigid opaque walls. Motion of the walls can affect the radiation. If the walls are not opaque, then the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is not isolated. It is of interest to explain how the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is attained. There are two main cases: (a) when the approach to <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is in the presence of matter, when the walls of the cavity are imperfectly reflective for every wavelength or when the walls are perfectly reflective while the cavity contains a small black body (this was the main case considered by Planck); or (b) when the approach to equilibrium is in the absence of matter, when the walls are perfectly reflective for all wavelengths and the cavity contains no matter. For matter not enclosed in such a cavity, thermal radiation can be approximately explained by appropriate use of Planck's law.|$|E
