5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, {{but they did not}} have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E

While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> things in a simpler way. So {{without a lot of}} fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E

Massaro approached the WWE with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before {{she had to leave}} for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get used to being outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6–1 vote.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had gone out of business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a {{straight}} re-release {{of the game}} initially seemed like {{a straight}}-forward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS. For example, to get the graphics to look identical to their 1996 incarnation, {{they had to be}} completely rewritten for the new device; behind the replication of the original's 2D isometric graphics, a 3D game engine is running, which must convert the graphics in real time.|$|E
25|$|Both the Brabham {{team and}} their gearbox {{supplier}} Weismann {{lay claim to}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this with the tall BMW engine {{in order to create}} a car with very low bodywork that would allow a large supply of air to reach the rear wing undisturbed and create more downforce without harming the straight line potential with high drag. The driver was placed in a lying down position (approximately 30° according to Murray), as had been common in the 1960s, but had become rare by the 1980s. BMW designed a special version of their four-cylinder turbocharged engine with the engine block tilted almost horizontally (18° from horizontal).|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Ullman {{returned}} to British television with the ITV television comedy special, Tracey Ullman: A Class Act. She {{was joined by}} Monty Python alum, Michael Palin. A Class Act took a satirical jab at the British class system. The special {{proved to be a}} critical success, garnering the attention of American cable television network, HBO. The network approached Ullman with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a special for them, with the caveat that she take on a more American subject. Tracey Ullman Takes On New York was another critical and award-winning success, sparking HBO to offer Ullman her own series. Tracey Takes On... ran for four seasons (1996–1999), raking up numerous accolades and critical praise. It eventually aired on Channel 5 in the UK in 1998.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> an {{animated}} film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed about during {{the production of}} The Rescuers. Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children's book series Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus, but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to The Rescuers. In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children's book series into {{an animated}} feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President and CEO Ron Miller who approved the project. Earlier in his career, Clements created a fifteen-minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on Super 8 film. Because the animators were displeased with the direction The Black Cauldron was heading, Basil of Baker Street was approved as an alternative project.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a radio {{variety show}} {{occurred}} to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 – April 4, 1943) of The Jack Benny Program, radio's most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases. A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 – July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, The Orson Welles Almanac presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many {{of the shows}} originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of The Mercury Wonder Show. The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Readymades <b>did</b> not fully develop until 1915. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> was {{to question the}} very notion of Art, and the adoration of art, which Duchamp found [...] "unnecessary".|$|R

500|$|Darabont {{described}} {{the process of}} developing the series and setting it up at a network as [...] "four years of frustration".

[...] "They were very excited about <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a zombie show until I handed them a zombie script where zombies were actually doing zombie shit," [...] he stated. Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. [...] "Gale was tremendously instrumental in jump-starting it at a point where it felt like it was languishing, [...] "he asserted. [...] "I'd gotten turned down enough times, which is no reflection on the material, but no matter what you're trying to sell in Hollywood, you're Willy Loman and it's Death of a Salesman. You're out there trying to sell shit that nobody wants. Even if it's good shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{split the}} {{composition}} into two panels {{to separate the}} action from its consequence. The left panel features the attacking plane—placed at a diagonal {{to create a sense}} of depth—below the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane. In the right panel, the exploding plane—depicted head-on—is outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation [...] "WHAAM!". Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events, the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile. Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: [...] "I remember being concerned with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] {{originated}} {{from a personal}} episode of Al Jean's life; when Jean was in third grade, he received a valentine from a girl that read [...] "I Choo-Choo-Choose You". Years later, Jean wondered if the girl had really liked him. He told writing partner Mike Reiss about it and they thought {{it could be an}} idea for an episode where Lisa could give such a valentine to Ralph Wiggum, who would then take it too far. At that time, Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related. Jean thought it would be funny if Ralph was Wiggum's son, considering both characters are [...] "fat and dumb". A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think [...] "what holiday haven't we done on The Simpsons, or done lately?". As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before, the staff liked <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a Valentine's Day episode.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> const-ness <b>does</b> {{not imply}} that the {{variable}} as it is stored in the computer's memory is unwritable.

500|$|Although not {{the first}} to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when {{producer}} Joel Surnow thought of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> [...] "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a [...] "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display {{at the beginning and end}} of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.|$|E

2500|$|Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, {{playing their}} {{respective}} Seinfeld characters, {{appeared in a}} spot presented during halftime of the 2014 Super Bowl on February 2.

An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled [...] "The Over-Cheer". [...] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, who produces the series, did not pay for it. Seinfeld has indicated that he thinks the webisode will probably be the last cast reunion, saying, [...] "I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience." ...|$|E
