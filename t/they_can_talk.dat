25|$|As in {{many major}} cities, {{immigrants}} to New York often congregate in ethnic enclaves where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> and shop {{and work with}} people from their country of origin. Throughout the five boroughs the city is home to many distinct communities of Indians, Irish, Italians, Chinese, Koreans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Caribbeans, Hasidic Jews, Latin Americas, Russians and many others. Many of the largest citywide annual events are parades celebrating the heritage of New York’s ethnic communities. Attendance at the biggest ones by city and state politicians is politically obligatory. These include the St Patrick's Day Parade, probably the top Irish heritage parade in the Americas; the Puerto Rican Day Parade, which often draws up to 3 million spectators; the West Indian Labor Day Parade, among the largest parades in North America and the largest event in New York City; and the Chinese New Year Parade.

The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases, who <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to. As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene, they are saved as Edgeworth's thoughts. Using the [...] "logic" [...] function, the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information; for instance, by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once, Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must {{have been at the}} crime scene. At some points, the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene; by using the [...] "deduction" [...] function at these points, the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence. If the player successfully points out a contradiction, they gain access to new information. At certain points, a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene; by investigating these reproductions, the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. As more evidence is uncovered, the hologram is updated. After having examined an area sufficiently, the investigation phase ends, and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase.|$|E

500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible.

Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner.

Regardless of where the pow wow takes place geographically, when a person does not know the proper etiquette at that specific pow wow, it is best to remain quiet until there is a break and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> specifically to the staff or arena director. Proper etiquette is important for not only those attending the pow wows but for performers as well. Many of these rules have been in place for hundreds of years and many are new. They are always in a constant state of modification. Some rules for common sense courtesy include, all singers and dancers who are under the influence of drugs while performing will be disqualified. For dancers, when a song is finished, both feet must be on the ground yet the body can be in any position. Dancers must be in full dress and prepared to start within ten minutes of grand entry time. Dancers also must always keep in time with the drum beat and bells must be worn at all times.
