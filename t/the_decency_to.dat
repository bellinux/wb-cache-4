5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E
25|$|While K.L. Devaser {{was quite}} outspoken, his {{influence}} was largely among the urban-based Indian elite and he lacked wider grassroots support. For {{the first eight}} years, the MIC leaders were either of North Indian or Malayalee origin, representing a minority among the Malayan Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were Tamils, mainly the labourers in plantations. Indian plantation workers, the main group of wageworkers in Malaya at the time, experienced enforced segregation because of plantation compound housing. The plantation labour system also worked against the integration of Indian workers into society at large and perpetuated racial and occupational differentiation. For one thing, {{they were unable to}} acquire skills that would facilitate their move to betterpaying jobs elsewhere. Migrant plantation workers were therefore marginalized and polarized in Malaya. Their wages in the post World War II era, which were around 50 cents a day, were tied to rubber prices, falling when the rubber price fell, but never rising when prices rose. K.L. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party’s grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily Tamil Murasu urged Tamils to boycott the MIC. Even in 1955, the Indians clamored for a change in MIC’s leadership and a change did take place because the president had <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> recognize that he has overstayed his welcome and gave way for change.The MIC's main challenge then, was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the needs of the labour class, who then comprised 84% of the plantation workforce.|$|E

"Wonderwall" [...] was {{featured}} in the popular mashup [...] "Boulevard of Broken Songs" [...] mixed by Party Ben in late 2004, which also contained parts of both Travis's [...] "Writing to Reach You" [...] and Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams". In late 2006, Gallagher accused Green Day of 'ripping off' [...] "Wonderwall", saying [...] "If you listen, you'll find it {{is exactly the same}} arrangement as [...] "Wonderwall".

2500|$|In December 2009, Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, {{called on}} the Senate to approve Johnsen and several other nominees, and denounced the [...] "unprecedented delays in the {{consideration}} of qualified and noncontroversial nominations". The Washington Post agreed, editorializing that the treatment of Johnsen's nomination was a [...] "travesty" [...] and adding: [...] "Ms. Johnsen is highly qualified and should be confirmed. At the very least, senators should have <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> give her an up-or-down vote." [...] Nevertheless, the Senate did not act on the nomination before it ended its 2009 session. [...] As a result, the nomination {{was sent back to}} the White House, leaving Obama to decide whether to renominate Johnsen. Obama also had the option of making a recess appointment, which would have enabled Johnsen to fill the post {{until the end of the}} 2010 session of the Senate.|$|E

Lyrically, the song'a protagonist [...] "laments {{the end of a}} relationship", while confronting her mother {{regarding}} her early abandonment. Additionally, during its bridge, Carey [...] "eerily" [...] refers to abortion, [...] "You could have had <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> / <b>To</b> give me up / Before you gave me life", as an option over abandoning the child.|$|R

60|$|Forgotten--forgotten was the College and <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> due <b>to</b> elders! McTurk was {{treading}} {{again the}} barren purple mountains of the rainy West coast, where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked acres, only {{son of a}} three-hundred-year-old house, lord of a crazy fishing-boat, and the idol of his father's shiftless tenantry. It was the landed man speaking to his equal--deep calling to deep--and the old gentleman acknowledged the cry.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} the perusal of Waterbuck, Q.C.'s opinion, and, going upstairs, entered her room, for she did not lock her doors till bed-time--she had <b>the</b> <b>decency,</b> he found, <b>to</b> save the {{feelings}} of the servants. She was brushing her hair, and turned to him with strange fierceness.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] he said, [...] "and now I {{learn that}} you have been holding clandestine {{meetings}} with a man who is my enemy, with a man who has done me more harm than any other single individual, with a man whom I will not have in my house--do you understand?

5000|$|Holloway is annoyed. Presumably {{he understands}} what he’s being asked for but avoids showing that he does. Instead he {{complains}} {{about the fact}} that, despite his being dragged out on a night like this, his old friend has not had <b>the</b> common <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> heat and light the room suitably let alone provide a proper welcome {{and some kind of}} refreshment. He says he is going to leave, regretting having come in the first place, but doesn’t make any move to go.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's always usual to {{read the}} will {{immediately}} after the funeral,' said Lady Le Breton, firmly, to whom the ordinary usage of society formed an absolutely unanswerable argument; 'and how you, Ronald, who haven't even <b>the</b> common <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> wear a bit of crape around your arm for her--a thing that Ernest himself, with all his nonsensical theories, consents to do--can talk in that absurd way about what's quite right and proper to be done, I for my part, really can't imagine.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{punishment for}} women {{found guilty of}} treason was to be burned at the stake, where they {{did not need to}} be publicly displayed naked, whereas men were hanged, drawn and quartered. The jurist William Blackstone argued as follows for the differential punishment of females vs. males: For as <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> due <b>to</b> sex forbids the exposing and public mangling of their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows and there be burned alive ...|$|R
6000|$|Then in a querulous tone, ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs, Boulte added--"'Seems {{rather a}} pity that you haven't <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> {{keep to the}} woman, now you've got her. You've been a true friend to her too, haven't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound him, {{he might}} have had <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> have backed the scheme. I could do such a lovely ballad, rottin' it; and now I'll have to be a giddy enthusiast. It don't bar our pulling Stalky's leg in the study, does it?" ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA (again on {{the verge}} of tears). Well, then, I do. I am {{responsible}} for her going--I'm not ashamed of it. Her remaining here was an affront to all right thinking people. I appealed to her, and she had <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
5000|$|Keith Uhlich of UGO {{said the}} film is [...] "cheap, ugly, deadening, lacking even <b>the</b> common <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> be unintentionally funny, the sheer ineptitude {{increasing}} with each passing scene." [...] Film Jabber said The Scorpion King 2 [...] "lacks action, excitement and, more importantly, quality," [...] adding: [...] "While the production values are decent enough for a film like this, you can tell from minute one that this movie was made simply {{to coincide with the}} theatrical release of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor." [...] Mark Pollard of Kung Fu Cinema said that [...] "the lead actors keep the movie marginally entertaining long after the predictable plot, generic effects work, and poorly-edited screen fighting grows weary." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "While the {{defendant}} committed this horrific crime, what is also so disturbing {{about this case}} is the indifference of the people employed at the bar that night. This court cannot speak to the legal implications of serving someone who is intoxicated, and indeed that issue may be before another judge, but this court can decry the complete indifference and inhumanity of the workers there that night. They were all focused on finishing their shift and leaving. Not {{one of those people}} spared a thought to the wisdom of sending an intoxicated young woman out into the deserted streets of Manhattan at 4 a.m. If only one of them had <b>the</b> common <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> call a taxi, we might not be here in this courtroom today." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} weeks of the case, Nifong gave an {{estimated}} 50 to 70 interviews. On the day he received his first briefing by police, March 27, 2006, he told the press, [...] "The circumstances of the rape indicated a deep racial motivation {{for some of the}} things that were done." [...] By April 1 he had made 48 statements to the press, including assertions that others present at the party were covering for the accused players, saying, [...] "I would like to think that somebody who was not in the bathroom has <b>the</b> human <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> call up and say, 'What am I doing covering up for a bunch of hooligans?'" [...] Initial media reports on the case largely reflected Nifong's statements and opinions.|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} I got {{him and his}} {{correspondence}} into the motor, and he had <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> ask whether he had been unpolished over-night. I replied that I waited an apology. This he made excuse for renewed arguments, and used wayside shows as illustrations of the decadence of England.|$|E
6000|$|... "That you {{and your}} wife lead a cat and dog {{existence}} is a disgrace to both of you. At least you might have <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> try and hide it from the world--not make a jest of your shame to every passing stranger. You are a cad, sir, a cad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He said of Lady Byron's mother, 'She always detested me, {{and had not}} <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> conceal it in her own house.

6000|$|The news of Lady Crawley's death {{provoked}} no more grief or comment {{than might}} have been expected in Miss Crawley's family circle. [...] "I suppose I must put off my party for the 3rd," [...] Miss Crawley said; and added, after a pause, [...] "I hope my brother will have <b>the</b> <b>decency</b> not <b>to</b> marry again." [...] "What a confounded rage Pitt will be in if he does," [...] Rawdon remarked, with his usual regard for his elder brother. Rebecca said nothing. She seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the family. She left the room before Rawdon went away that day; but they met by chance below, as he was going away after taking leave, and had a parley together.|$|R
6000|$|Por. Since {{she must}} suffer, if I do not speak, [...] 'Tis time <b>the</b> laws of <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> break. [...] She told me, sir, that she your choice approved, [...] And (though I blush to own it) said she loved; [...] Loved me desertless, who, with shame, confest [...] Another flame had seized upon my breast; [...] Which when, too late, the generous princess knew, [...] And feared your justice would my crime pursue, [...] Upon herself {{she makes the}} tempest fall, [...] And my refusal her {{contempt}} would call.|$|R
6000|$|After that Mr. Trafford had {{one clear}} desire in his being which ruled all his other desires. He wanted a long, frank, unembarrassed and {{uninterrupted}} conversation with Marjorie. He {{had a very}} strong impression that Marjorie wanted exactly the same thing. For a week he besieged the situation in vain. After the fourth day Solomonson was only kept in Buryhamstreet by sheer will-power, exerted with a brutality that threatened to end that friendship abruptly. He went home on the sixth day in his largest car, but Trafford stayed on beyond <b>the</b> limits of <b>decency</b> <b>to</b> perform some incomprehensible service that he spoke of as [...] "clearing up." ...|$|R
