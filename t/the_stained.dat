The church contains a stained glass window dedicated to Aldenham, and a Book of Remembrance is displayed in front of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass window, along with a White Ensign. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass window memorial was unveiled {{on the occasion of}} the 50th anniversary of sinking of Aldenham by surviving shipmates Martin and Maurais.|$|E
5|$|The cloisters were {{restored}} in the 20thcentury, and <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass windows contain {{the images of}} some 130saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled The water of life by Stephen Broadbent. The refectory roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F.H.Crossley. The east window with reticulated tracery was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and is dated 1913. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass in the west window, depicting the Creation, was designed by Ros Grimshaw and installed in 2001 to celebrate the Millennium. On the refectory's west wall there is a tapestry depicting Elymas being struck with blindness which was woven at Mortlake in the 17thcentury from a cartoon by Raphael. The heraldic paintings on the north wall represent {{the arms of the}} Earls of Chester.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass in}} the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E
5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass windows}} at Kirkpatrick Chapel are {{approximately}} twenty lancet windows along the chapel's side aisles that were donated by graduating {{classes at the}} turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1890–1912).

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>stains</b> or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> and reveal <b>the</b> texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. <b>The</b> <b>stain</b> is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> and <b>the</b> rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|R
5|$|The 17th century saw {{the loss}} {{of many of the}} church {{fittings}} and much of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass during the Reformation and the English Civil War. During the reign of Queen Anne, and partially funded by her, the interior of St. Mary Redcliffe was refitted in the Baroque style.|$|E
5|$|The south aisle was {{shortened}} {{in about}} 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass in the}} apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below this is a mosaic designed by J.R.Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass in the aisle is by Wailes, and by Hardman & Co. to a design by Pugin. The aisle contains the tomb of Ranulf Higdon, a monk at St Werburgh's Abbey in the 12thcentury who wrote a major work of history entitled Polychronicon, a monument to Thomas Brassey (a civil engineering contractor who died in 1870), designed by Blomfield and made by Wagmuller, a monument to Bishop Peploe who died in 1752, and three painted monuments {{by a member of}} the Randle Holme family.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E

50|$|Back Sponging:The <b>stained</b> side of <b>the</b> {{material}} is placed {{face down on}} a clean, absorbent, material. The back of the fabric is then sponged with a sponge that is soaked in the solvent being used. It {{is important not to}} rub the material with the sponge, but to use a padding motion, so as not to spread <b>the</b> <b>stain.</b> <b>The</b> solvent dissolves <b>the</b> <b>stain,</b> which is deposited on the absorbent material beneath. To completely remove <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> {{it may be necessary to}} use more than one absorbent pad.|$|R
50|$|Front Sponging:This is {{the most}} common way of {{treating}} non-washable fabrics. The front of the fabric is sponged with a sponge that is soaked in the solvent being used. The rear of the fabric should be backed up with a clean, absorbent, material. <b>The</b> <b>stain</b> is rubbed with the sponge radially, from the centre of <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> towards its edge. It is important not to rub the sponge in a circular motion, as that causes <b>the</b> <b>stain</b> to spread in rings.|$|R
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|The chapel on {{the upper}} floor became a store room in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass window of the chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ {{on the other hand}} is far more recent, {{acquired}} from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{underwent}} a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite {{the complexity of}} the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration. The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E

5|$|The current church, St Andrew's and St Peter's, {{was built}} in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style with buttressed walls and a square tower. The pipe organ was added by Norman & Beard in 1914, and in 1922 Oscar Paterson contributed some of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass windows such as 'The Sower'. In 2013 gravestones were vandalised in the graveyard.

5|$|The parish of Wormshill was {{originally}} appended {{to the village}} and parish of Boughton Malherbe, since both had the same patron; the patron of a parish was the land-owner who often built the church on the estate and who had the right (known as advowson) to appoint the parish priest. The first recorded patron of Wormshill was Robert de Gatton, who owned the Manor of Wormsell {{during the reign of}} Henry III (120772). From the Gatton family, the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood, whose family crest appears in <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass of St Giles, the village's only church, and whose name (Norwood) is given to the farm at the north of the village.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass windows}} of the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
