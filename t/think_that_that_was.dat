500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a real person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|E

I {{personally}} do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a good idea, but I believe {{in many of these}} cases where there's real dispute in the country, these things {{are not going to be}} ever resolved. [...] People are going to have different ideas. <b>That's</b> why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy <b>that's</b> contrary to the traditions of this country and changing <b>that</b> overnight. And <b>that's</b> what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|R

2500|$|About {{contemporary}} American {{poetry and}} her own risk-taking in her work she said: “Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry.

[...] "But we've matured as musicians over time, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> <b>been</b> reflected in the music.

500|$|In a 2011 {{appearance}} {{as host of}} Saturday Night Live while promoting his film The Muppets, Jason Segel mentioned The Land of Gorch in his opening monologue.

In 2013, writer Jay Fosgitt marketed to publishing company Archaia Entertainment the idea of reviving The Land of Gorch characters in comic book format with a new storyline.|$|R

I felt that it depended upon so many circumstances, that I thought it would be a waste of time to trace it.|$|E
60|$|Looking around me, I was {{inclined}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not improbable. It was {{too dark to see}} far, but what I could see was anything but promising. The country was perfectly flat, dreary, and barren, and the view was unbroken by tree, or hedge, or hill. By {{the side of the road}} was a small canal, over the sullen waters of which, and across the road, brooded spectral-like clouds of mist. The rain still fell rapidly, and the wheels of our cart ran noiselessly in the sandy, paste-like mud.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-five {{years past}} the Weiser’s vision of Ubiquitous Computing, {{and there is}} not a clear {{understanding}} of what is or is not a pervasive system. Due to the loose boundaries of such paradigm, almost any kind of remotely ac-cessible networked system is classified as a pervasive system.

60|$|Fourth: Stealing unawares {{upon the}} whale in the fancied {{security}} of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean {{as if it were}} a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the smoke from the touch-hole.|$|E
60|$|You see, Striped Chipmunk {{had known}} {{all the time}} that Happy Jack was spying on him, and he had had no end of fun fooling Happy Jack by {{suddenly}} disappearing and then bobbing into view. He had known that Happy Jack was following him so as to find out where his storehouse was. Then Striped Chipmunk had remembered the storehouse of Chatterer the Red Squirrel. He had filled the pockets in his cheeks with acorns and gone straight over to Chatterer's storehouse and put them inside, knowing that Happy Jack would follow him and would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> his storehouse. And that is just what happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{place was}} {{threatened}} in 1720 and, {{in the beginning}} of 1727, twenty thousand Spaniards again sat down before it. The fortifications had been made a good deal stronger, after the first siege; and the garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Governor Clayton. The siege lasted till May, when news arrived that the preliminaries of a general peace had been signed. There was a lot of firing; but the Spaniards must have shot mighty badly, for we had only three hundred killed and wounded. You would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> enough; but when I tell you that the cannon were so old and rotten that seventy cannon, and thirty mortars, burst during the siege, {{it seems to me that}} every one of those three hundred must have been damaged by our own cannon, and that the Spaniards did not succeed in hitting a single man.|$|E

40|$|In Mathematical Thought and Its Objects, Charles Parsons argues <b>that</b> our {{knowledge}} of the iterability of functions on the natural numbers and of the validity of complete induction is not intuitive knowledge; Brouwer disagrees on both counts.

I will not argue <b>that</b> Parsons <b>is</b> wrong once his own conception of intuition is granted, as I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the case. But I will try to make two points: (1) Using elements from Husserl and from Brouwer, Brouwer's claims can be justified in more detail than he has done; (2) There are certain elements in Parsons' discussion <b>that,</b> when developed further, would lead to Brouwer's notion thus analysed, or at least something relevantly similar to it.

6000|$|... "That will suit me admirably." [...] Mr. Atherton said. [...] "A boating {{excursion}} up {{an unknown}} river {{is just the}} thing I like--that is, when the boat is a reasonable size. I was once fool enough on the Amazon to allow myself to be persuaded that a canoe at most two feet wide would carry me, and the tortures I suffered during that expedition, wedged {{in the bottom of}} that canoe, and holding on to the sides, I shall never forget. The rascally Indians made matters worse by occasionally giving sly lurches to the boat, and being within an ace of capsizing her. I had two days of that work before I got to a village where I could obtain a craft of reasonable size, and I should think I must have lost two stone in weight during the time. You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> rather an advantage I can see, Miss Mitford," [...] he broke off, seeing a smile upon the girl's face. [...] "Well, yes, I could spare that and more, but I should prefer that it was abstracted by other means than that of agony of mind; besides, these improvements are not permanent." ...|$|E

I tell you that I {{do not believe that}} Andrea will ever, under any circumstances, join in any war against England, nor any war which has for its object the {{crushing}} of France. In his mind the Triple Alliance was the most selfish alliance which any country has ever entered into, but so long as the other two Powers understood the situation, it was scarcely Italy's part to point out the fact that she gained everything by it and risked nothing. Italy has sheltered herself for years under its provisions, but neither at the time of signing it, nor at any other time, has she had the slightest intention of joining in an aggressive war at the request of her allies. You see, her Government felt themselves safe--and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> where Andrea was so clever--in promising to fulfil their obligations in case of an attack by any other Power upon Germany or Austria, because it was perfectly certain to Andrea, and to every person of common sense, that no such aggressive attack would ever be made. You read Austria's demands from Servia in the paper this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This seems a {{good place}} wherein to preach on American versatility. When Mr. Howells writes a novel, when a {{reckless}} hero dams a flood by heaving a dynamite-shattered mountain into it, or when a notoriety-hunting preacher marries a couple in a balloon, you shall hear the great American press rise {{on its hind legs}} and walk round mouthing over the versatility of the American citizen. And he is versatile--horribly so. The unlimited exercise of the right of private judgment (which, by the way, is a weapon not one man in ten is competent to handle), his blatant cocksureness, and the dry-air-bred restlessness that makes him crawl all over the furniture when he is talking to you, conspire to make him versatile. But what he calls versatility the impartial bystander of Anglo-Indian extraction is apt to deem mere casualness, and dangerous casualness at that. No man can grasp the inwardness of an employ by the light of pure reason--even though that reason be republican. He must serve an apprenticeship to one craft and learn that craft all the days of his life if he wishes to excel therein. Otherwise he merely [...] "puts the thing through somehow;" [...] and occasionally he doesn't. But wherein lies the beauty of this form of mental suppleness? Old man California, whom I shall love and respect always, told me one or two anecdotes about American versatility and its consequences that came back to my mind with direful force as the train progressed. We didn't upset, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the fault of the driver or the men who made the track. Take up--you can easily find them--the accounts of ten consecutive railway catastrophes--not little accidents, but first-class fatalities, when the long cars turn over, take fire, and roast the luckless occupants alive. To seven out of the ten you shall find appended the cheerful statement: [...] "The accident is supposed to have been due to the rails spreading." [...] That means the metals were spiked down to the ties with such versatility that the spikes or the tracks drew under the constant vibration of the traffic, and the metals opened out. No one is hanged for these little affairs.|$|E

So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an embarrassment about our past <b>that</b> <b>is</b> probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|R
