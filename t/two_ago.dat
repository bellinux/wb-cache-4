500|$|Bourdon's agent, Kent Hughes, {{stated that}} he never knew about his client's new hobby (motorcycles). [...] "I had no idea," [...] he {{explained}} to CKNW in Vancouver. [...] "Another client of ours, Kris Letang, said Luc let him know he was riding his dad's motorcycle with some friends a week or <b>two</b> <b>ago.</b> I have since been told—though I don't know—that he actually bought a motorcycle two days ago". Maryse Bourdon, Luc's stepmother, said he had purchased the motorcycle about three weeks before. Letang, Bourdon's close friend and former roommate from junior hockey, planned to buy a motorcycle after Bourdon told him about his; because of the crash, he decided against it.|$|E
500|$|... 'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year or <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> down the street from where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been really sad to witness." [...] 'Edward Benz, 27 Times' {{is the story of a}} father dealing with the pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son, while [...] "I See Everything" [...] describes parents losing their seven-year-old son to cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike a {{generation}} or <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> many colleges with music programs now offer {{students the opportunity to}} major in euphonium. [...] However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2–4 is common), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium. [...] Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.|$|E

50|$|While English is {{generally}} seen as lacking postpositions entirely, {{there are a}} couple of words that one can in fact view as postpositions, e.g. the crisis <b>two</b> years <b>ago,</b> sleep the whole night through.
