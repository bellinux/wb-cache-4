5|$|Boone offers Bryan $25,000 {{to break}} up with Shannon but Bryan asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that Bryan {{is not the first}} man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to him to get the money, and she has done <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} Duchy of Parma was {{the smallest}} Bourbon court. So aggressive in its anti-clericalism was the Parmesan {{reaction to the}} news of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Naples, that Pope Clement XIII addressed a public warning against it on January 30, 1768, threatening the Duchy with ecclesiastical censures. At <b>this,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Bourbon courts turned against the Holy See, demanding the entire dissolution of the Jesuits. Parma expelled the Jesuits from its territories, confiscating their possessions.|$|E

500|$|During {{the same}} summer, new shirt designs were {{revealed}} by the band through social media, two of which state [...] "2000-2018". One of the designs was also projected onto the stage after the band's show {{on the same day}} at the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver, increasing the amount of speculation regarding that the band may be implying a planned breakup in the year 2018. Frontman Lacey confirmed of the speculation in between songs during a set in Salt Lake City, Utah in June. He stated [...] "We’re done. Oh yeah, we’re done, and it makes nights like <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more special so thanks for being here." ...|$|E
500|$|Later episodes follow Twilight and {{her friends}} dealing with various {{problems}} around Ponyville, including interpersonal problems between friends and family, {{as well as more}} adventurous stories involving creatures like dragons and hydras, and having to save Equestria from villainous characters. At the end of each episode, Twilight sends a report back to Celestia explaining what she learned about friendship from these adventures. This part of the formula is abandoned in [...] "Lesson Zero", the second-season episode in which Twilight is convinced to be less rigid in her perceived duties; after <b>this,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> principals contribute reports, although the formality is disregarded when appropriate. In the fourth season, with the request for reports no longer applicable, the six resolve to keep a collective personal journal in which they record their thoughts about life for posterity.|$|E

500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{giving his}} decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his {{daughter}} by force, {{all those who}} had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> suitors readily agreed, each believing {{that he would be}} given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, [...] "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as {{of the time of}} the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Hero" [...] was {{the subject}} of two {{copyright}} plagiarism cases; one by Christopher Selletti and the other by Rhonda Dimmie, filed in 1993 and 1996. Selletti claimed he had written the song's lyrics {{in the form of a}} poem. One day, as he drove Sly Stone in a limousine to Long Island, he claimed to have shown him the poem. Selletti claimed Stone complimented the poem, taking it and promising to patent it and earn him royalties. After many months, the pair fell out of contact, leading Selletti to mail himself the envelope and poem, performing a [...] "poor man's copyright." [...] Three years later in 1996, he claimed to have listened to Carey's album Music Box and was shocked when he noted the song's similar lyrics. He filed a lawsuit against Carey, Stone, Sony and Stone's manager Jerry Goldstein. Selletti claimed that Stone must have sold or contributed the lyrics to Carey during the recording of the album in late 1992. However, since Stone did not receive songwriting credits on [...] "Hero", Selletti then dropped the suit against Stone, leaving him against Carey and Sony. Prior to their court room meeting, Carey told New York Daily News [...] "I feel totally victimized. 'Hero' is my creation and it holds a very special meaning to me. I have every intention of fighting <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way." [...] In court, Carey provided evidence to her innocence, in the form of a dated lyrical and music notebook, with conceptual info on the song dated back to November 20, 1992, prior to Selletti's meeting with Stone. Additionally, Carey stated the fact that she had originally written it for the film Hero alongside Afanasieff, making their connection or the involvement of his material impossible. Judge Denny Chin found Carey innocent, and ordered Selletti to pay her a fine.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the themes}} of This Addiction were heavily {{influenced}} by the band members' personal lives.

2500|$|In a February 2017 {{review of}} the aircraft's history, AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircraft's failure on an empty weight that was too high, fragile {{construction}} and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots. He stated, [...] "the Skycatcher can’t keep up because it wasn’t really designed as an LSA. It’s a scaled-down Cessna 152, which is a scaled-down Cessna 172, which is a scaled-down 747. I hope I’m not bursting anyone’s bubble {{by pointing out that}} Cessna is not exactly a modern innovator in design of light aircraft."

2500|$|With {{the help}} of the author Alex Haley in 1972 and Mormon {{researchers}} in Salt Lake City, Jones discovered that his mother's ancestors included James Lanier, a relative of Sidney Lanier, the poet. Jones said in an interview, [...] "He had a baby with my great-grandmother , and my grandmother was born there [...] We traced <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to the Laniers, same family as Tennessee Williams." [...] Learning that the Lanier immigrant ancestors were French Huguenot refugees, who had court musicians among their ancestors, Jones attributed some of his musicianship to them. In a 2009 BBC interview, Jones said Haley also helped him learn that his father was of part Welsh ancestry.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of a game, each player shuffles his or her deck. [...] Players then decide who will start, using any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, for example). Each player then draws seven cards from his or her library to form his or her starting hand. In turn order, each player may then decide to mulligan; that player shuffles his or her hand and library together and draws a new hand of one fewer card. A player can do <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way down to a zero-card hand if he or she wishes, drawing one fewer card each time. In multiplayer games, players can mulligan for free one time, drawing seven cards a second time. Any further mulligans draw one card fewer each time, as normal.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Francis, even as {{the bishops}} at Vatican II, {{prioritized}} the teaching of Jesus over scholastic theologies (see below: Sexual morality as Good News). He made an {{option for the poor}} the most visible priority of his papacy, Few would disagree that this option has enjoyed a special primacy throughout Christian history. Francis concludes that the church should be [...] "poor and for the poor" [...] (EG 198), with [...] "creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone". Without <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> religious practices and talk of social issues will be just a camouflage (EG 207).

2500|$|A patch was {{released}} September 9, 2010 to fix {{issues in the}} game. [...] Players can no longer use collision glitches with the world geometry {{to find ways to}} cheat on the game's leaderboards. [...] Additionally the patch adds an audible beep to players who sit idle in multiplayer lobbies, prompting them to set their status to [...] "ready". The patch also decreases the amount of time to wait on players who do not finish multiplayer races. [...] Vector Unit later removed glitched times from the game's leaderboards in November 2010. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} PlayStation 3 port of the game, the company stated [...] "People ask us <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, and unfortunately the answer is no.

2500|$|The line is in {{many ways}} unique, not least because it still {{operates}} entirely with its original rolling stock, except winter saloon 22, which was completely rebuilt following a fire in 1990 after which the bodywork was no longer usable. A considerable amount of stock was lost in a disastrous fire at Laxey in 1930, but other than <b>this</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> original stock remains.

The line belongs to the Isle of Man Government as part of the Department of Community, Culture & Leisure, which does not see the requirement to retain unused stock that has no potential use or long-term storage place on the railway. The line has Lisbon tram purchased in 1999, but this has never seen use due to clearance difficulties (it was used as a passenger waiting shelter for a spell). It is no longer on the railway, but remains on the island.|$|E
