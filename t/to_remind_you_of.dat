Instead of repetitive shout outs of, [...] "how you doing Dublin", the Boys simply churn out hit after hit without pausing for breath. Sure, they haven't re-invented the wheel musically, yet they prove in style that they've already left a considerable legacy of entertainment." [...] Vicki Kellaway (Liverpool Echo) gave the band a 10 out 10 remarking, [...] "They are utterly shameless. You might think four men {{with an average age}} of 32 (I’m sorry <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> that) would feel they are beyond the baggy jeans, printed hoodies, huge trainers and exaggerated ‘running man’ dance moves. Oh no. You might as well give a crowd what they want. This was not one of those we’ll-hit-you-with-our-new-material and throw in a medley for fun. It was pure nostalgia." ...|$|E

I am curious to know whether what I have heard of her voice in a passion is enough to make me recognize her voice when she is calm. I possess a little memorial of her visit of which she is not aware, and she will not escape me so easily as she thinks. If it turns out a useful memorial, you shall know what it is.

6000|$|Foolish men {{imagine that}} because {{judgment}} for an evil thing is delayed, {{there is no}} justice, but an accidental one, here below. Judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or two, some century or two, but it is sure as life, it is sure as death! In {{the centre of the}} world-whirlwind, verily now as in the oldest days, dwells and speaks a God. The great soul of the world is just. O brother, can it be needful now, at this late epoch of experience, after eighteen centuries of Christian preaching for one thing, <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>thee</b> <b>of</b> such a fact; which all manner of Mahometans, old Pagan Romans, Jews, Scythians and heathen Greeks, and indeed more or less all men that God made, have managed at one time to see into; nay which thou thyself, till 'redtape' strangled the inner life <b>of</b> <b>thee,</b> hadst once some inkling of: That there is justice here below; and even, at bottom, that there is nothing else but justice! Forget that, thou hast forgotten all. Success will never more attend thee: how can it now? Thou hast the whole Universe against thee. No more success: mere sham-success, for a day and days; rising ever higher,--towards its Tarpeian Rock. Alas, how, in thy soft-hung Longacre vehicle, of polished leather to the bodily eye, of redtape philosophy, of expediences, clubroom moralities, Parliamentary majorities to the mind's eye, thou beautifully rollest: but knowest thou whitherward? It is towards the road's end. Old use-and-wont; established methods, habitudes, once true and wise; man's noblest tendency, his perseverance, and man's ignoblest, his inertia; whatsoever of noble and ignoble Conservatism there is in men and Nations, strongest always in the strongest men and Nations: all this is as a road to thee, paved smooth through the abyss,--till all this end. Till men's bitter necessities can endure thee no more. Till Nature's patience with thee is done; and there is no road or footing any farther, and the abyss yawns sheer!-- ...|$|R

50|$|Eleven {{years had}} passed by since Ananda Mohan joined Vyasashram. To reach the goal of {{ultimate}} aspiration, he felt that his entry into Sannyas stage (Hermitage) was an absolute necessity, and for total renunciation of worldly affairs. All the stipulations of the Malayalaswami to grant sannyas had already been satisfied by Ananda Mohan. On 29 June 1947, {{it was decided to}} perform consecration rites of Sannyasa on Ananda Mohan as per five-day tradition at the ashram. All arrangements were made to grant the deeksha as per Vedic rights, Knowing this many well known people, sadhus from many parts arrived at the ashram. As per Giri tradition (Dashanami Sampradaya and Kriya Yoga), Malayalaswami gave Ananda Mohan his new name Swāmī Vidyāprakāśānanda Giri, and thus conferred on him all the rights to teach and preach advaita philosophy, and on the name, Malayalaswami suggested that since you are to propagate earnestly Vedic knowledge, <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> constantly <b>of</b> my intentions, I propose you this new name.Thus Ananda Mohan had transformed himself to Swāmī Vidyā Prakāśānanda Giri, his fame has spread many areas and was respected as he was an expert in practising what he preaches.|$|R

6000|$|His Epistles are of divers merit, but all {{discover}} Dryden's usual sense, sarcastic observation, {{and sweeping}} force of style. The best are that to Sir Godfrey Kneller--remarkable for its knowledge of, and graceful tribute to, the [...] "serene and silent art" [...] of painting; {{and the very}} noble epistle addressed <b>to</b> Congreve, which <b>reminds</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> one giant hand of genius held out to welcome and embrace another. Gross flatterer as Dryden often was, {{there is something in}} this epistle that rings true, and the emotion in it you feel even all his powers could never have enabled him to counterfeit. Such generous patronage of rising, by acknowledged merit, was as rare then as it is still. The envy of the literary man too often crowns his gray hairs with a chaplet of nightshade, and pours its dark poison into the latest cup of existence.|$|R

We were at St. John's then; you were right above me--in a different world altogether. You were a leader amongst the best of them, and I was a hanger-on amongst the worst. You were in with the gentlemen set and the reading set. Neither of them would {{have anything to do with}} me--and they were quite right. I was what they thought me--a cad. I'd no head for work, and no taste for anything worth doing, and I wasn't a gentleman, and hadn't sense to behave like one. I'd no right to have been at the University at all, but my poor old dad would have me go. He had an idea that he could make a gentleman of me. It was a mistake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{the points}} to which I {{directed}} particular attention {{on that occasion}} were these: in the first place, that instruction in physical science supplies information of a character of especial value, both in a practical and a speculative point of view--information which cannot be obtained otherwise; and, in the second place, that, as educational discipline, it supplies, in a better form than any other study can supply, exercise in a special form of logic, and a peculiar method of testing the validity of our processes of inquiry. I said further, that, even at that time, a great and increasing attention was being paid to physical science in our schools and colleges, and that, most assuredly, such attention must go on growing and increasing, until education in these matters occupied a very much {{larger share of the}} time which is given to teaching and training, than had been the case heretofore. And I threw all the strength of argumentation of which I was possessed into the support of these propositions. But I venture <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you,</b> also, <b>of</b> some other words I used at that time, and which I ask permission to read to you. They were these:--"There are other forms of culture besides physical science, and I should be profoundly sorry to see the fact forgotten, or even to observe a tendency to starve or cripple literary or aesthetic culture for the sake of science. Such a narrow view of the nature of education {{has nothing to do with}} my firm conclusion that a complete and thorough scientific culture ought to be introduced into all schools." ...|$|R
