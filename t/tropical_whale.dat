50|$|<b>Tropical</b> {{bottlenose}} <b>whale</b> observations indicate {{they travel}} in larger groups {{than any other}} local species of beaked whales. The size of the pods range from the tens up to 100, with 15 to 20 being fairly typical, and the groups appear very cohesive. Their pods are sometimes associated with other species, such as short-finned pilot whales, bottlenose dolphins, spinner dolphins, and humpback <b>whales.</b> <b>Tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales</b> {{have been known to}} breach the surface, and they normally have visible, but short, blows. Their dives last between 11 and 33 minutes, with one individual diving for least 45 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Hyperoodon (or Hyperoödon) is a genus of beaked whale, {{containing}} {{just two}} species: the Northern and Southern bottlenose whales. Longman's beaked whales are alternatively called <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales</b> {{due to their}} physical features resembling those of bottlenose whales.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, {{the first}} {{confirmed}} sighting {{was made of}} <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales</b> in the southern Bay of Bengal. In {{the summer and fall}} of 2010, researchers aboard the NOAA ship McArthur II made two sightings of groups of <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales</b> off Hawaii. The first sighting consisted of a [...] "large, active group" [...] of over 70 individuals surfacing rapidly and breaching on occasion; the second sighting, late in October, did not last as long, as the group [...] "ran away". Increasingly more sightings and strandings have been recorded in Taiwan and surrounding small islands such as at Yilanthe Green Island, and Orchid Island. An entangled individual was saved by local fishermen off Pakistan in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Longman's {{beaked whale}} (Indopacetus pacificus, {{also known as}} the Indo-Pacific beaked <b>whale</b> or the <b>tropical</b> {{bottlenose}} <b>whale)</b> was originally assigned to Mesoplodon, but Joseph Curtis Moore placed it in its own genus, Indopacetus, a taxonomic assignment which has been followed by all researchers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tropical</b> {{bottlenose}} <b>whale</b> (Indopacetus pacificus), {{also known}} as the Indo-Pacific beaked whale and the Longman's beaked whale, was considered to be the world's rarest cetacean until recently, but the spade-toothed whale now holds that position. , the species is now known from nearly a dozen strandings and over 65 sightings.|$|R
50|$|Humpback {{whales are}} one of over 20 species of marine mammals that can be {{observed}} in the area. The <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whale,</b> fin and pilot whales along with large pods of bottle-nosed, common and spinner dolphins are common. Examples of toothed whales such as the orca and sperm whale are also seasonable visitors.|$|R
50|$|There are {{no records}} of the whale being hunted, {{although}} individuals have been trapped in fishing nets off Sri Lanka and a stranding in Taiwan in 2005 involving a cow-calf pair {{may have been due}} to nearby naval exercises. Due to their rather uncommon nature, their conservation status is unknown. The <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whale</b> is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).|$|R
5|$|Marine mammals {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, <b>tropical</b> <b>whales</b> decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to have eliminated 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles, likely aiding in its extinction; megalodon may have been too large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales which had migrated there.|$|R
50|$|Dark {{markings}} {{are also}} {{present on the}} tip of the beak and rostrum. The females have a simpler coloration; the body is typically grayish except for a brown head. The coloration appears to be rather variable in this species. The female specimen from the Maldives was six metres (20 feet) in length, with a one-metre (3 foot) fetus, and the Japanese female was 6.5 metres (22 feet) in length. Reports of <b>tropical</b> beaked <b>whales</b> put them even longer, in the 7-9 metre (23-29.5 foot) range, which is larger than any mesoplodont and more typical of a bottlenose whale. No weight estimation or reproductive information is known.|$|R
50|$|An {{adult male}} {{specimen}} {{has yet to}} wash up, but sightings of the <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whale</b> indicate they have a rather bulbous melon, two teeth located towards {{the front of the}} beak, and scars from fighting with the teeth. Scars from cookiecutter sharks are also rather common on the whale. The rather unusual coloration of the juveniles helped connect the Longman's to the tropical bottlenose whale; both have dark backs behind the blowholes, which quickly shade down to a light gray and then white. The blackness from the back extends down to the eye of the whale except for a light spot behind the eye, and then continues on in a line towards the flipper, which is also dark.|$|R
50|$|A geologically young body of water, the Gulf of Aden has {{a unique}} {{biodiversity}} that contains many varieties of fish, coral, seabirds and invertebrates. This rich ecological diversity has benefited from a relative lack of pollution during the history of human habitation around the gulf. However, environmental groups fear {{that the lack of}} a coordinated effort to control pollution may jeopardize the gulf's ecosphere. Whales, dolphins, and dugongs were once common before being severely reduced by commercial hunts, including by mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 70s. Critically endangered Arabian humpback whales were used to be seen in large numbers, and only a few of large whales still occur in the gulf waters such as bryde's whales, blue whales, and toothed whales inhabiting deep-seas such as sperm whales and less known <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{killer whale}} (Orcinus orca) {{is the largest}} species of the Dolphin family. The species is found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to warm, <b>tropical</b> seas.Killer <b>whales</b> are intelligent, {{versatile}} and opportunistic predators. Some populations feed mostly on fish, and other populations hunt marine mammals, including sea lions, seals, walruses, large whales and some species of shark. They are considered an apex predator, having no natural predators in their environment. There are up to five distinct killer whale types, {{some of which may}} be separate races, subspecies or even species. Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups, which are the most stable of any animal species. The sophisticated social behavior, hunting techniques, and vocal behavior of killer whales have been described as manifestations of culture.|$|R
5000|$|Whales also {{frequent}} the river, mainly at {{the larger}} Harrington Inlet, although some do enter the Farquar Inlet and {{generally do not}} venture far up river. However, on 16 September 1994 a rare <b>tropical</b> Bryde's <b>whale</b> measuring 9 m long, nicknamed [...] "Free Willy" [...] by locals, ventured much further up river to Taree. After becoming a tourist attraction, and repeatedly evading attempts by conservationists to free him [...] "Free Willy" [...] was finally rescued by Seaworld Staff in conjunction with NSW National Parks And Wildlife and ORCA (Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia). [...] "Willy" [...] became stranded on a sandbar, and {{with the assistance of}} a specially designed inflatable Cetacean Rescue Device, floated and towed back out to sea and was last seen heading for deeper water to the east.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} happened when Dalebout et al. (2003) [...] used {{a combination of}} genetic and morphological analyses to identify four further specimens, including a complete adult female with a fetus found in the Maldives in January 2000. The other remains consisted of a skull from Kenya collected some time before 1968, and two juvenile males from South Africa from strandings in 1976 and 1992, respectively. Based on morphological analyses, Dalebout et al. (2003) concluded that the genus Indopacetus was a valid one. The {{external appearance and colour}} pattern of this species was also revealed, and a firm connection was established with the mysterious <b>tropical</b> bottlenose <b>whales</b> that had been sighted in the Indian and Pacific Oceans since the 1960s. While this paper was in press, a specimen that was first mis-identified as a Baird's beaked whale washed up in Kagoshima, Japan in July 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to <b>tropical</b> seas. Killer <b>whales</b> have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal which preys on them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaHUg0wSzo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaHUg0wSzo ...|$|R
40|$|Pilot {{whales are}} two {{cetacean}} species (Globicephala melas and G. macrorhynchus) whose distributions are correlated with water temperature and partially overlap {{in some areas}} like the North Atlantic Ocean. In the context of global warming, distribution range shifts are expected to occur in species affected by temperature. Consequently, a northward displacement of the <b>tropical</b> pilot <b>whale</b> G. macrorynchus is expected, eventually leading to increased secondary contact areas and opportunities for interspecific hybridization. Here, we describe genetic evidences of recurrent hybridization between pilot whales in northeast Atlantic Ocean. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite loci, asymmetric introgression of G. macrorhynchus genes into G. melas was observed. For the latter species, a significant correlation was found between historical population growth rate estimates and paleotemperature oscillations. Introgressive hybridization, current temperature increases and lower genetic variation in G. melas suggest that this species could be at risk in its northern range. Under increasing environmental and human-mediated stressors in the North Atlantic Ocean, it seems recommendable to develop a conservation program for G. melas...|$|R
50|$|Strandings and {{sightings}} {{indicate the}} species ranges across the Indian Ocean from {{southern and eastern}} Africa to the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and east to Myanmar with a Pacific range extending from Australia to Japan. However, if the sightings of <b>tropical</b> beaked <b>whales</b> are taken into account, the range of this whale is more extensive; they have been sighted from the Arabian Sea including Gulf of Aden to Guadalupe Island and the Gulf of California (the sightings off Mexico (in 1992 and 1993) are probably extralimital, as they are associated with abnormally warm water during El Niño events). There have also been possible sightings in the Gulf of Mexico, which may indicate they {{are present in the}} tropical Atlantic Ocean as well. The most frequent observations have occurred off the coasts of Hawaii. Although only a single specimen has washed up in Hawaii, they are apparently rather common; a 2002 survey estimated 766 animals. No other population estimates exist for other locales although a single individual was apparently identified in the Comoro Islands in the summer of 2002-2003. One whale was observed from a whale watching vessel off Choshi in December, 2015. Possible sightings were made off Tokara Islands and Bonin Islands as well. They have also recorded off New Caledonia.|$|R
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great <b>tropical</b> coral reefs. <b>Whaling</b> in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|R
50|$|Baleen whales {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a gigantic macropredator such as C. megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, additional extinctions occurred in the marine environment, and faunal redistribution took place; <b>tropical</b> great <b>whales</b> decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of C. megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages; it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Whale migratory patterns during the Pliocene have been reconstructed from the fossil record, suggesting that most surviving species of whales showed a trend towards polar regions. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of C. megalodon to polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales. As a result of these developments, the food supply for C. megalodon in regions it inhabited during the Pliocene, primarily in low-to-mid latitudes, was no longer sufficient to sustain it worldwide. C. megalodon was adapted to a specialized lifestyle, and this lifestyle was disturbed by these developments. Paleontologist Albert Sanders suggests that C. megalodon was too large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply. The resulting shortage of food sources in the tropics during Plio-Pleistocene times may have fueled cannibalism by C. megalodon. Juveniles were at increased risk from attacks by adults during times of starvation.|$|R
40|$|Whale sharks Rhincodon typus {{are large}} filter-feeders that are {{frequently}} observed feeding in surface zooplankton patches at their tropical and subtropical coastal aggregation sites. Using signature fatty acid (FA) analyses from their subdermal connective tissue and stomach content analysis, we tested whether whale sharks in Mozambique and South Africa predominantly feed on these prey and/or what other prey they target. Arachidonic acid (20 : 4 ω 6; mean ± SD = 17. 8 ± 2. 0 % of total FA), 18 : 0 and 18 : 1 ω 9 c were major FA of whale sharks, while in contrast, coastal epipelagic zooplankton collected near feeding whale sharks had 22 : 6 ω 3 (docosahexaenoic acid), 16 : 0 and 20 : 5 ω 3 (eicosapentaenoic acid) as major FA. Stomach contents of 3 stranded sharks {{were dominated by}} mysids (61 to 92 % of prey items), another one by sergestids (56 %), and a fifth stomach was empty. The dominant mysids (82 % index of relative importance) were demersal zooplankton that migrate into the water column at night, suggesting night-time feeding by whale sharks. High levels of bacterial FA in whale sharks (5. 3 ± 1. 4 % TFA), indicating a detrital link, potentially via demersal zooplankton, also support night-time foraging activity. High levels of oleic acid (16. 0 ± 2. 5 %) in whale sharks and their similarity with FA profiles of shrimp, mysids, copepods and myctophid fishes from the meso- and bathypelagic zone suggest that whale sharks also forage in deep-water. Our findings suggest that, in the patchy food environment of <b>tropical</b> systems, <b>whale</b> sharks forage in coastal waters {{during the day and}} night, and in oceanic waters on deep-water zooplankton and fishes during their long-distance movements.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{complementing}} studies of sperm whale social and vocal behaviour that were {{restricted to the}} Pacific Ocean. The characteristic multi-pulsed structure of sperm whale clicks allows for estimation of whales' size from measurements of the inter-pulse intervals (IPI). I have developed two new automatic methods for IPI estimation from clicks recorded during foraging dives. When compared to other previously developed methods, the newly developed method that averages several clicks' autocorrelation function showed the best performance amongst the automatic methods. Previous studies did not support individual identity advertisement among social unit members as the function for the sperm whale communication signals called codas. I tested within coda type variation for individual specific patterns and found that, while some coda types do not allow for individual discrimination, one did so. This variation suggests that different coda types may have distinct functions. Analysis of social structure in the Azores found that, similar to the Eastern <b>Tropical</b> Pacific, sperm <b>whales</b> form long term social units of about 12 individuals. Unlike the Pacific Ocean, Azorean social units do not form temporary groups with other units, suggesting differences in {{the costs and benefits}} of group formation. I argue that these are due to differences in terms of predation pressure and intraspecific competition between the Azores and the Pacific study sites. The variation of coda repertoires in the Atlantic also showed a pattern dissimilar to that previously documented in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. In the North Atlantic, coda repertoire variation is mostly geographic, which is parsimoniously explained by random drift of culturally transmitted coda repertoires. No sympatric vocal clans with distinct dialects were found as has been noted in the Pacific. Drawing upon the differences found in social structure I argue that selection for maximization of differences between units with similar foraging strategies may have led to the Pacific vocal clans. The differences between oceans suggest that sperm whales may adaptively adjust their behaviour according to experienced ecological conditions.
