5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely constrained by <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> both wheels {{to remain on}} the ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. <b>The</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements {{coincided with}} the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of}} the time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E

5|$|If {{dropping}} <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> {{the uniqueness}} of the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid.
