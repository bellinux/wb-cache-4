40|$|Biometric {{recognition}} {{systems have}} been widely used globally. However, one effective and highly accurate biometric authentication method, palmprint recognition, has not been popularly applied as it should have been, which could be {{due to the lack of}} small, flexible and user-friendly acquisition systems. To expand the use of palmprint biometrics, we propose a novel palmprint acquisition system based on the <b>line-scan</b> image <b>sensor.</b> The proposed system consists of a customized and highly integrated <b>line-scan</b> <b>sensor,</b> a self-adaptive synchronizing unit, and a field-programmable gate array controller with a cross-platform interface. The volume of the proposed system is over 94 % smaller than the volume of existing palmprint systems, without compromising its verification performance. The verification performance of the proposed system was tested on a database of 8000 samples collected from 250 people, and the equal error rate is 0. 048 %, which is comparable to the best area camera-based systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} newly {{developed}} linear CMOS high-speed <b>line-scanning</b> <b>sensor</b> realized in a 0. 35 μm CMOS OPTO process for line-scan with 200 kHz true RGB and 600 kHz monochrome line rate, respectively. In total, 60 lines are integrated in the sensor allowing for electronic position adjustment. The lines are read out in rolling shutter manner. The high readout speed is achieved by a column-wise organization of the readout chain. At full speed, the sensor provides RGB color images with a spatial resolution down to 50 μm. This feature enables a variety of applications like quality assurance in print inspection, real-time surveillance of railroad tracks, in-line monitoring in flat panel fabrication lines and many more. The sensor has a fill-factor close to 100 %, preventing aliasing and color artefacts. Hence the tri-linear technology is robust against aliasing ensuring better inspection quality and thus less waste in production lines...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new multiple view line-scan imaging technique utilising a single area array camera. This {{is based on}} the concept of treating the camera's area array sensor as a contiguous set of <b>line-scan</b> <b>sensors.</b> The resultant images are accumulated in digital memory whilst the object under inspection is translated through the field of view of the camera. In this way a number of perspective images can be produced. This imaging technique has potential to model a multiple view line-scan x-ray imaging system. 1. Introduction An area array imaging sensor can be considered as a set of contiguous vertical or horizontal linear arrays. In other words the area array imager in combination with a standard lens can be used to produce a `slit' field of view. This can be considered identical to that produced by a dedicated line-scan system [1][2][3]. This is illustrated in Figure 1. Thus by cyclically storing image information from a single predetermined column on the sensor surface a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} concurrent printing and {{scanning of documents}} has been constructed. By taking a personal computer ink-jet printer and modifying it to include a <b>line-scan</b> <b>sensor,</b> major benefits are derived. Both conventional printers and scanners contain mechanisms for moving either documents, sensors or mirrors. Combining a printer and a scanner into a single device offers a potential reduction in cost because the printer's mechanisms then serve a double duty. A scanner makes available to the personal computer user established commercial applications such as image digitization and facsimile. Moreover, unique document processing features are possible when a scanner is present in a printing device. With documents already containing some information, intelligent printing annotation can be performed. For example, a previously scanned and digitized picture can be printed on a new document already containing text and open space. Scaling, positioning and printing of the digitized picture to fit within the open space is archived through scanning and analyzing the new document. The physical and functional characteristics of the printer/scanner system are described. Principles relevant to the design, construction and application of the printer/scanner are given, and present and future applications discussed. by Jeffrey David Keast. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new automatic and effective quarantine system for detecting pest infestation sites in agricultural products, e. g. fruits. This work integrated mechanical design, mechatronics instrumentation, X-ray and charge-coupled device (CCD) image acquisition devices, LabVIEW-based analysis and control software, and image diagnosis algorithms into the automatic X-ray quarantine scanner system. Based on the LabVIEW development platform, a friendly {{graphical user interface}} (GUI) was designed for assisting the operations of quarantine scanner system. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of pest quarantine process, a control scheme for performing start-up procedure of the system, parameter setting and calibration of the X-ray source and <b>line-scan</b> <b>sensor,</b> and automatic inspection for pest were developed. A novel pest infestation detector consisted of image processing algorithms were also proposed to aid the operator in identifying possibly infested fruits. The image processing procedures include contrast enhancement, median filtering, mathematical morphology operators, and adaptive thresholding by statistical z-test for identifying the infested sites of fruit on an X-ray image. Experimental {{results show that the}} X-ray quarantine scanner and pest infestation detector are able to locate the infested sites with highly successful rate up to 94 % on the 4 th day after eggs implanted. Furthermore, both intact and egg-implanted fruits were used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of the proposed system. The evaluation results are respectively 96. 8 %, 98. 6 %, 97. 7 %, and 98. 7 %, which are significantly better than traditional visual inspection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This MEng (Master of Engineering) {{research}} thesis {{evaluates the}} capabilities {{and limitations of}} line-scan thermography for the non-destructive evaluation of composite structures containing hidden defects. In simple terms, line-scan thermography is a state-of-the-art technique in which a focused line of thermal energy is transmitted into a material. Line-scan thermography has great potential for the rapid and low cost non-destructive inspection of composite structures for aircraft, automobiles and ships. In this project, theoretical research exploring the heat transfer physics was undertaken in conjunction with experimental studies to develop an optimum inspection regime for line-scan thermography. The capability of line-scan thermography to detect impact damage in carbon/epoxy laminates was experimentally investigated in Chapter 3. From the impact side, in all materials, line-sc an thermography overestimated {{the size of the}} impact damage whereas flash thermography underestimated the size. There was a close relationship between the ultrasonic profile and the <b>line-scan</b> <b>thermographic</b> thermal response curve. New experimental data has been produced and analysed for the ability of line-scan thermography to determine the defect as well as the defect size. It was found that line-scan thermography was able to distinguish back drilled holes, but {{it was not possible to}} determine accurate defect sizing due to the depth of the holes from the inspected surface and the limitations associated with the <b>line-scan</b> <b>thermographic</b> apparatus itself. There was excellent correlation between the C-scan ultrasonics intensity curves and the line-scan thermographs as well as excellent correlation with the theoretical results. The relationship between line-scan thermography and foreign body objects were experimentally investigated for carbon/epoxy composites. A major limitation found with line-scan thermography is its limited depth penetration, which is highlighted in the foreign object study using 6 mm and 13 mm diameter Teflon® discs and 13 mm Teflon® strips embedded in carbon/epoxy laminates. Depth penetration allowed only 2 mm resolution for the 13 mm diameter discs and 1. 5 mm resolution for the 6 mm discs in a composite panel. The results of the investigation of stainless steel shim objects in carbon/epoxy laminates reveal that line-scan thermography is capable of determining their presence and size close to the surface. There was also excellent correlation between the ultrasonic response curve and the <b>line-scan</b> <b>thermographic</b> intensity curve. The results of the investigation of thermoplastic film foreign body objects in carbon/epoxy laminates show that at present line-scan thermography does not have the capability to determin e such defects. Experimental results show that line-scan thermography is capable of detecting large voids, back drilled holes, some foreign body objects, and impact damage. However, the ability of line-scan thermography to measure the defect dimensions is dependent on the size and type of damage, the distance from the line source, the depth of the defect, and the type of composite material...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel notion of Epipolar Plane Range Image (EPRI). A <b>line-scanning</b> laser range <b>sensor</b> {{is mounted on}} the side of our data {{acquisition}} vehicle, repeating drawing horizontal scanning lines. Laminating the line range data along time axis, we can follow temporal continuity of horizontal cross section of the geometry seen from the scanner, hence can estimate the motion of the vehicle. Applying these information to another vertical-line-scanning range data we can align the position of the scanning lines, and can efficiently get correct 3 D geometric model of the real urban space, even if the vehicle travels in arbitrary speed without any external devices as GPS...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This study aims to {{introduce}} a new-generation videokymographic system, which provides simultaneous laryngoscopic and kymographic image, for routine clinical vocal fold examination. Study Design: The authors explored a new imaging method for diagnosis and evaluation of voice disorders. Methods. The new-generation videokymographic system includes two charge-coupled device image sensors, a color area image sensor, and a monochromic highspeed <b>line-scan</b> image <b>sensor.</b> The high-speed linescan image sensor is used to capture the kymogram, and the color area image sensor is used to obtain the laryngoscopic image. The two images can be displayed simultaneously on a video monitor or stored in a standard video recorder. Three subjects with nonpathologic voice were investigated in detail with the new videokymographic system. Results: The high-quality laryngoscopic image and kymogram can be used directly for clinical purposes with no further postprocessing. The scan position of the kymogram is always indicated in the laryngoscopic image, which provides feedback for the operator to easily locate the expected scanning position. All varieties of vocal fold vibration, including irregular vibrations, phonation onset and offset, can be observed with the presented method. The continuous kymogram of the vocal fold vibration can be retrieved from a kymographic image sequence for quantitative analysis. Conclusions. The new-generation videokymography provides a simple, quick means to investigate vocal fold vibration, especially for voice disorders. It can emerge as an important tool for routine clinical vocal fold examination...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a fully autonomous system {{for building a}} 3 D model of an object in situ. Our system assumes no knowledge of object other than that it is within a bounding box whose location and size are known a priori, and furthermore, the environment is unknown. The system consists of a mobile manipulator, a powerbot mobile base with a {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOF) powercube arm mounted on it. The arm and the powerbot are equipped with <b>line-scan</b> range <b>sensors,</b> which provide range images that are used to build the work space Octree model and the object point cloud model. The object modeling system is comprised of three broad modules: (i) 3 D model construction, (ii) a modeling view planner, which determines the next scanning pose for modeling, and (iii) a path planner, which determines a collision-free path to move the mobile-manipulator to a desired pose. Our research focuses on automating this process, which concerns the last two modules. Our modeling view planner calculates the target areas to be scanned, and then efficiently searches the five-dimensional viewpoint space to determine the best viewpoint for scanning the target areas. The path planning module itself consists of two subproblems: (a) exploration view planning, and (b) basic path planning. The former concerns developing an exploration strategy that facilitates manoeuvering the mobile-manipulator, for which we provide a formulation of C-space entropy reduction for range sensors for occupancy grid maps. For the basic path planning, a probabilistic Roadmap method (SBIC-PRM) is used for moving the mobile-manipulator to the view configuration. To construct a complete autonomous 3 D modeling system, all three modules are repeatedly solved in an interleaved fashion. The process of modeling continues until a formally proved termination criteria is satisfied. We present extensive experimental results with our 3 D object modeling system running on this real test-bed. The robot is started in unknown environments, and builds the object model in less than 35 scans. Each iteration takes about 4 minutes. The experimental results show the ability and efficacy of the system both in modeling the object and in the required exploration of the environment...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers impose an {{enormous}} {{burden on the}} society worldwide and {{a significant proportion of}} this burden can be prevented through early cancer detection and treatment. Current screening and surveillance protocols rely primarily on conventional white light endoscopy, the accuracy and efficacy of which need to be improved. The main objective of this research is to develop and optimize novel multi-scale optical imaging modalities to improve detection of GI cancers with enhanced imaging performance and increased clinical ease of use at a low cost. A modular video endoscope (MVE) was developed to combine widefield with high-resolution imaging modalities. Trimodal imaging, including standard white light imaging (WLI), vital-dye fluorescence imaging (VFI) and high-resolution microendoscopy (HRME), was enabled in a single endoscopic insertion. A pilot in vivo clinical trial showed that glandular architectural dysregulation, as visualized in VFI and HRME, was associated with cancer progression in Barrett’s esophagus (BE). The MVE/HRME platform was further evaluated for gastric cancer detection. In both ex vivo and in vivo pilot studies, early cancers were found to be highlighted by alterations in glandular patterns and nuclear morphology in VFI and HRME. Preliminary data in the in vivo trial showed that the platform may be useful to detect additional advanced lesions, but suggested that the specificity needs to be improved. A low-cost confocal HRME was developed to improve the axial performance of HRME with optical sectioning. By synchronizing a digital light projector (DLP) with the rolling shutter of a CMOS <b>sensor,</b> <b>line-scanning</b> confocal imaging was enabled in a compact design. Initial ex vivo validation in imaging squamous and columnar epithelium of mouse specimens demonstrated that optical sectioning improved the visualization of nuclear morphometry, especially in crowded regions with degraded image quality using a conventional HRME. Automated analysis of HRME images was also explored to facilitate its clinical applications. In 58 in vivo colorectal HRME images, a set of clinically relevant features were quantified. A 3 -feature model was developed through linear discriminant analysis to achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 91 % and 89 %, and an AUC of 0. 94 in classification of neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps. The unique contributions of this research are the development of multi-scale imaging modalities with enhanced imaging performance and improved clinical ease of use. Computer-aided interpretation of clinical data was also investigated. These results can potentially contribute to improved early GI cancer detection, especially in community and low-resource settings...|$|R
