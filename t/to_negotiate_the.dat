5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E

The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated they were willing <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{military}} supremacy over land, Simeon I {{was aware that}} he needed naval assistance in order to seize Constantinople.

5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only {{served as a}} pretext to worsen relations.
