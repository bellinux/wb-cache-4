25|$|The {{presence}} of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs has been controversial. Finely preserved specimens from the Holzmaden Lagerstätten in Germany {{found in the}} late nineteenth century revealed additional traces, usually preserved in black, of the outline of the entire body, including the first evidence of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs. Unique conditions permitted the preservation of these outlines, which probably consist of bacterial mats, not the remains of the original tissues themselves. In 1987, David Martill argued that, given <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> of conservation by bacteria, it was unlikely that these outlines were reliably preserved in any fine detail. He concluded that no authentic dorsal fins had been discovered. After displaced skins flaps from the body would have initially been misinterpreted as fins, fossil preparators later came to expect such fins to be present, and would have identified any discolouration in the appropriate position as a dorsal fin or even have falsified such structures. The lack of a dorsal fin would also explain why ichthyosaurs, contrary to porpoises, retained hind flippers, as these were needed for stability. Other researchers noted that, while the outlines might have been sharpened and smoothed by preparators because fossil bacterial mats usually have indistinct edges, many of the preserved dorsal fins were probably authentic and at least somewhat close to the true body outline. At least one specimen, R158 (in the collections of the Paleontologiska Museet, Uppsala Universitet), shows the expected faded edges of a bacterial mat, so it has not been altered by preparators, yet still preserves a generally tuna-like body outline including a dorsal fin. In 1993, Martill admitted that at least some dorsal fin specimens are authentic.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> {{estimates}} leeway {{by subtracting}} a sea current vector {{from the total}} displacement vector to estimate the leeway vector.

60|$|The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, therefore, or as I have {{otherwise}} called it, <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Method</b> of Difference (because, like the Method of Difference properly so-called, it proceeds by ascertaining how {{and in what}} the cases where the phenomenon is present differ from those {{in which it is}} absent) is, after the Direct Method of Difference, the most powerful of the remaining instruments of inductive investigation; and in the sciences which depend on pure observation, with little or no aid from experiment, this method, so well exemplified in the speculation on the cause of dew, is the primary resource, so far as direct appeals to experience are concerned.|$|E
6000|$|This method may {{be called}} <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Method</b> of Difference, or the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference; and {{consists}} in a double employment of the Method of Agreement, each proof being independent of the other, and corroborating it.

60|$|It thus {{appears that}} the {{instances}} in which much dew is deposited, which are very various, agree in this, and, {{so far as we}} are able to observe, in this only, that they either radiate heat rapidly or conduct it slowly: qualities between which there is no other circumstance of agreement than that by virtue of either, the body tends to lose heat from the surface more rapidly than it can be restored from within. The instances, on the contrary, in which no dew, or but a small quantity of it, is formed, and which are also extremely various, agree (as far as we can observe) in nothing except in not having this same property. We seem, therefore, to have detected the characteristic difference between the substances on which dew is produced and those on which it is not produced. And thus have been realized the requisitions of what we have termed <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Method</b> of Difference, or the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference. The example afforded of this indirect method, and of {{the manner in which the}} data are prepared for it by the Methods of Agreement and of Concomitant Variations, is the most important of all the illustrations of induction afforded by this interesting speculation.|$|E
60|$|In {{the absence}} of the direct, we may next try, as in other cases, the {{supplementary}} resource, called in a former place <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Method</b> of Difference; which, instead of two instances differing in nothing but {{the presence or absence of}} a given circumstance, compares two classes of instances respectively agreeing in nothing but the presence of a circumstance on the one side and its absence on the other. To choose the most advantageous case conceivable (a case far too advantageous to be ever obtained), suppose that we compare one nation which has a restrictive policy with two or more nations agreeing in nothing but in permitting free trade. We need not now suppose that either of these nations agrees with the first in all its circumstances; one may agree with it in some of its circumstances, and another in the remainder. And it may be argued, that if these nations remain poorer than the restrictive nation, it can not be for want either of the first or of the second set of circumstances, but it must be for want of the protective system. If (we might say) the restrictive nation had prospered from the one set of causes, the first of the free-trade nations would have prospered equally; if by reason of the other, the second would; but neither has; therefore the prosperity was owing to the restrictions. This will be allowed to be a very favorable specimen of an argument from specific experience in politics, and if this be inconclusive, it would not be easy to find another preferable to it.|$|E
60|$|The {{preceding}} instances have afforded an induction of a {{high order}} of conclusiveness, illustrative of the two simplest of our four methods; though not rising to the maximum of certainty which the Method of Difference, in its most perfect exemplification, is capable of affording. For (let us not forget) the positive instance and the negative one which the rigor of that method requires, ought to differ only in {{the presence or absence}} of one single circumstance. Now, in the preceding argument, they differ in the presence or absence not of a single circumstance, but of a single substance: and as every substance has innumerable properties, there is no knowing what number of real differences are involved in what is nominally and apparently only one difference. It is conceivable that the antidote, the peroxide of iron for example, may counteract the poison through some other of its properties than that of forming an insoluble compound with it; and if so, the theory would fall to the ground, so far as it is supported by that instance. This source of uncertainty, which is a serious hinderance to all extensive generalizations in chemistry, is, however, reduced in the present case to almost the lowest degree possible, when we find that not only one substance, but many substances, possess the capacity of acting as antidotes to metallic poisons, and that all these agree in the property of forming insoluble compounds with the poisons, while they can not be ascertained to agree in any other property whatsoever. We have thus, in favor of the theory, all the evidence which can be obtained by what we termed <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Method</b> of Difference, or the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference; the evidence of which, though it never can amount to that of the Method of Difference properly so called, may approach indefinitely near to it.|$|E

Nevertheless, these methods involve positive pressure ventilation and can be influenced by underlying lung pathology like pneumothorax, pneumonia etc.|$|R
60|$|From confirmations thus {{furnished}} by sociology to physiology, {{let us now}} pass to {{a suggestion}} similarly furnished. A factory, or other producing establishment, or a town made up of such establishments, is an agency for elaborating some commodity consumed by society at large; and may be regarded as analogous to a gland or viscus in an individual organism. If we inquire what is the primitive mode in which one of these producing establishments grows up, we find it to be this. A single worker, who himself sells the produce of his labour, is the germ. His business increasing, he employs helpers--his sons or others; and having done this, he becomes a vendor not only of his own handiwork, but of that of others. A further increase of his business compels him to multiply his assistants, and his sale grows so rapid that he is obliged to confine himself {{to the process of}} selling: he ceases to be a producer, and becomes simply a channel through which the produce of others is conveyed to the public. Should his prosperity rise yet higher, he finds that he is unable to manage even the sale of his commodities, and has to employ others, probably of his own family, to aid him in selling; so that, to him as a main channel are now added subordinate channels. Moreover, when there grow up in one place, as a Manchester or a Birmingham, many establishments of like kind, this process is carried still further. There arise factors and buyers, who are the channels through which is transmitted the produce of many factories; and we believe that primarily these factors were manufacturers who undertook to dispose of the produce of smaller houses as well as their own, and ultimately became salesmen only. Under a converse aspect, all the stages of this development have been within these few years exemplified in our railway contractors. There are sundry men now living who illustrate the whole process in their own persons--men who were originally navvies, digging and wheeling; who then undertook some small sub-contract, and worked along with those they paid; who presently took larger contracts, and employed foremen; and who now contract for whole railways, and let portions to sub-contractors. That is to say, we have men who were originally workers, but have finally become the main channels out of which diverge secondary channels, which again bifurcate into the subordinate channels, through which flows the money (representing the nutriment) supplied by society to the actual makers of the railway. Now it seems worth inquiring whether this is not the original course followed in the evolution of secreting and excreting organs in an animal. We know that such is the process by which the liver is developed. Out of the group of bile-cells forming the germ of it, some centrally-placed ones, lying next to the intestine, are transformed into ducts through which the secretion of the peripheral bile-cells is poured into the intestine; and as the peripheral bile-cells multiply, there similarly arise secondary ducts emptying themselves into the main ones; tertiary ones into these; and so on. Recent inquiries show that the like is the case with the lungs,--that the bronchial tubes are thus formed. But while analogy suggests that this is the original mode in which such organs are developed, {{it at the same time}} suggests that this does not necessarily continue to be the mode. For as we find that in the social organism, manufacturing establishments are no longer commonly developed through the series of modifications above described, but now mostly arise by the direct transformation of a number of persons into master, clerks, foremen, workers, &c.; so the approximate method of forming organs, may in some cases be replaced by a direct metamorphosis of the organic units into the destined structure, without any transitional structures being passed through. That there are organs thus formed is an ascertained fact; and the additional question which analogy suggests is, whether the direct method is substituted for <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

30|$|Recently, field {{emitters}} using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been}} utilized as cold electron sources for high-resolution X-ray apparatuses[1 – 3]. To use CNTs as electron sources, the turn-on electric field that triggers the field-driven electron emission must be low, and the generated emission current level must be high. Simultaneously, {{the stability of}} the emission current must be ensured during a long-term operation. Here, CNTs can be prepared on various types of substrates such as flat types and tip types either by direct[4 – 6] or indirect[7 – 10] <b>methods.</b> Practically, <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> have certain advantages over the direct methods due to their simpler deposition systems, lower costs, lower processing temperatures, and easier scale-up. However, <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> demonstrate weak adhesion often with the widely utilized metallic substrates[11, 12]. Under a prolonged emission condition, CNTs may be removed on substrates due to their weak adhesion. This makes it difficult to obtain uniform and consistent emission currents from the CNT emitter. For this reason, most of <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> have employed flat-type substrates in preparing CNTs. The use of flat-type substrates, on the other hand, would be less desirable than the use of tip-type substrates for the application of CNTs as electron sources for micro-focus X-ray systems[13]. Therefore, the combination of tip-type substrates and <b>indirect</b> deposition <b>methods</b> is recommended for such application of CNTs only if good adhesion and high levels of emitted currents are guaranteed. Regarding this issue, we have suggested the use of interlayer with hafnium (Hf) thin films between CNTs and tungsten (W) tips[14].|$|R
