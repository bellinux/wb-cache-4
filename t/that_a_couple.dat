Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, Marvel Studios {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of short}} films {{would be released}} direct-to-video, which were designed to be self-contained stories and known as Marvel One-Shots.

[...] One of the ideas developed as a potential One-Shot was a spin-off from , following the story of Peggy Carter after the events of that film. The idea was looked at again when Marvel was deciding on a short film to produce for the home media release of Iron Man 3 in 2013, and it was chosen for the spot, dependent on actress Hayley Atwell's availability.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of this investigation, GM {{announced}} that it would offer any new GM car in exchange to any Volt owner who has concerns while the federal investigation was taking place. In December 2011, the company said that if necessary they were prepared to recall all the vehicles and repair them upon determination of the cause of the fires, and also announced they would buy back the car if the owner was too afraid of the potential for a fire. GM's CEO also said that {{it may be necessary to}} redesign or make changes to the battery pack depending on the recommendations from federal officials. As of December 1, 33 Volt owners in the U.S. and 3 in Canada had requested a loaner car. As of December 5, General Motors reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> dozen Volt owners had requested the carmaker to buy back their cars, and the company had already agreed to repurchase about a dozen. Before the carmaker agrees to buy back each vehicle, other options are explored as GM primarily wants to provide loaner cars, but [...] "if the only way we can make them happy is to repurchase it, then we will," [...] a GM spokesman said. General Motors explained that the buy back price includes the Volt purchase price, plus taxes and fees, less a usage fee based on how many miles the car has been run.

500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in a {{very complicated}} manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up}} with new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E
