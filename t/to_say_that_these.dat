5|$|Rutherford's {{government}} {{appointed a}} commission in February, {{but it was}} not until May that it met. It consisted of Chief Justice Arthur Sifton, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom. It began taking evidence in July. In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price. In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (other than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.|$|E
25|$|Certain exotic organisms do {{not seem}} to be subject to aging and can live indefinitely. Examples include Tardigrades and Hydras. That is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> organisms cannot die, merely that they only die as a result of disease or injury rather than age-related {{deterioration}} (and that they are not subject to the Hayflick limit).|$|E
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

3000|$|By definition, (i) is {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> for any c ∈C and map f:π (c) → i' cocartesian over I, {{there exists a}} map f':c → c' that lifts f (that is, π (f')=f), and is cocartesian both over I' and over I. Existence of lifting maps f' cocartesian over I' {{is equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> f^* has a left-adjoint f_!. As in Lemma  4.2, the condition on the maps (4.2) is then equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> maps f' are also cocartesian over I.|$|R

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E

[...] Cooper went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two waves, possibly followed by a third, continued {{in the direction of}} Fitzgerald and would have struck about the time she sank. This theory postulates that the [...] "three sisters" [...] compounded the twin problems of Fitzgeralds known list and her slower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual.|$|E

500|$|On March 5, 2009 at the O2 Arena, Jackson {{announced}} that he was to perform 10 concerts as part of a comeback. Jackson suggested likely post-show retirement by stating: [...] "I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, it really means this is it, this will be the final curtain call." [...] On March 11, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50— five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale. Jackson's 50 dates would make the concerts the longest residency at the arena. In May 2009, the show was originally set to have begun on July 8, 2009, and finished on March 6, 2010.|$|E
500|$|In 1907, Sifton was {{one member}} of a three-member {{commission}} assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. [...] His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. [...] Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. [...] The mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. [...] The commission recommended that children under sixteen {{should not be allowed to}} work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (except <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier Alexander Rutherford's government legislated an eight-hour day anyway.|$|E

5000|$|From a Roman Catholic perspective, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> all <b>these</b> irreconcilable {{beliefs are}} equally {{pleasing}} to God is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God has no preference for truth and to deny reason.

2500|$|Herodotus will {{at times}} relate various {{accounts}} of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io. However, Herodotus will at time arbitrate between varying accounts: [...] "I am not going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> events happened {{one way or the}} other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks." [...] Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: [...] "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the physics}} literature, the {{spectral}} theorem is often stated {{by saying that}} a self-adjoint operator has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

In {{the case of the}} momentum operator , for example, physicists would say that the eigenvectors are the functions , which are clearly not in the Hilbert space [...] (Physicists would say that the eigenvectors are [...] "non-normalizable.") Physicists would then go on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> [...] "eigenvectors" [...] are orthonormal in a continuous sense, where the usual Kronecker delta [...] is replaced by a Dirac delta function [...]|$|E

2500|$|Orzack's {{continued}} {{research into}} computer game addiction started {{to focus on}} multiplayer computer games, such as The Sims, EverQuest and World of Warcraft. Describing one of her patients who was regularly missing college lessons and becoming violent, she said [...] "Something {{is going on in}} his life that he is escaping. In the game, he finds a sense of belonging. Some say escape and some say fun, but most {{want to be part of}} an organization." [...] Orzack then went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> people are roleplaying and feel part of an organisation, something they may lack outside of the game. She also stated that some patients have been known to take drugs in order to continue playing, making her feel that the addiction is worse than that of drink or drugs. Withdrawal from gaming is not something Orzack recommended, as she felt this could lead to depression and violence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of Jackson's first 10 performances {{was made by}} the singer himself, during a press conference at the O2 Arena on March 5, 2009. As many as 7,000 fans and 350 reporters awaited the singer's arrival, many donning Jackson-related clothing. The singer commented at the conference, [...] "I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, it really means this is it", adding that it was his [...] "final curtain call", although he may have just been referring to performing in London. Organizers touted the residency as, [...] "dramatic shows [...] promise an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts". Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire commercial break period on ITV London during Dancing on Ice, the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the buildup}} to the 2004 presidential election, a dispute {{in the press}} {{occurred}} between O'Keefe and NASA climatologist James Hansen.

[...] Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck's hypotheses, {{one of which was}} the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. [...] "Although Eysenck is careful <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?" [...] Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that [...] "Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests," [...] whereas a [...] "quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ." [...] Some of Eysenck's later work was funded from the Pioneer Fund, an organization often criticised for allegedly promoting scientific racism, However, Eysenck himself was vehemently opposed to racism. As Eysenck stated, [...] "My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, and all they stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it (p. 40)." ...|$|E
