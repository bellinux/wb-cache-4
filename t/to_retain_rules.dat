50|$|The last {{novel of}} the series, it takes place from late 1943 to 1944. The Americans launch an {{airborne}} invasion that retakes Midway Island, and a military coup takes place in Germany. Hitler is killed and Germany is plunged into a civil war. As the new German government negotiates peace with the Allied powers, Germany retreats {{from most of the}} territories it conquered, but the British and French allow Germany <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>rule</b> over what was Czechoslovakia - even though the German invasion of that country was their original reason to go to war. The Baltic states and the Vilnius region become part of the USSR, while in the other parts of Eastern Europe the pre-war anti-Communist dictators <b>retain</b> their <b>rule</b> - such as Ion Antonescu in Romania and Miklós Horthy in Hungary. Stalin deploys troops into the eastern part of Russia, hinting at a new Russo-Japanese war to retake Vladivostok, and concludes an alliance with the United States, also involved in war with Japan. Jews in Germany have survived the years of Nazi harassment and the new military government returns their citizenship and full rights. The conservative German generals restore the flag of Imperial Germany, rather than that of the short-lived Weimar Republic, and Germany seems headed for an open-ended military dictatorship - nationalist and militarist, though not Nazi. Albert Einstein meets with Peggy Druce to find her ex-husband, Herbert, to try and convince him to continue funding the Manhattan Project - since the military-ruled Germany might get the Bomb first. Britain, too, remains under military rule. The British generals do promise to hold elections and restore Parliamentary democracy, but avoid setting a date. In Spain, Vaclav Jezek kills Nationalist leader General Sanjurjo, the Nationalist forces eventually surrender, and Spain is finally united under the left-wing Spanish Republic.|$|R

The Genoese supported the Bourbon French and Spain {{in order to prevent}} their mortal enemy the Kingdom of Sardinia from annexing the Mark of Finale Ligure, which would cut the republic in half. This decision resulted in a string of disasters— surrender to the Austrians on 6 September 1746 and the occupation of the city. There was a great popular insurrection in December 1746, precipitated by a boy named Giovan Battista Perasso and nicknamed Balilla, who threw a stone at an Austrian official and became a national hero to later generations. The Austrians were expelled, but returned for an unsuccessful Siege of Genoa in 1747. At least Genoa retained Finale in the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.

When Emperor Henry II died in 1024, Rudolph was still alive, sparking a new controversy in the Burgundian succession. Conrad II, as Henry II's successor, claimed he inherited Henry II's rights, but Rudolph disputed his claim. Count Odo II of Blois, who had familial ties to Rudolph, also claimed a right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph in August 1027 near Basel to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, the Empress Cunigunde of Luxembourg, mediated between the two parties.
