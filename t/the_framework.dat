40|$|The {{assessment}} and evaluation of the literacy achievements of ESL learners is emerging as a contentious issue in Australian schools. However, at this time no studies appear to be completed {{that focus on the}} identification of features of ESL children 2 ̆ 7 s writing and the processes involved in using <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> available in Western Australia to assess and evaluate ESL students. In this study, a qualitative research design was employed. Data were collected from one Year Five ESL student over a three week period in order to determine: a) which features of his English writing were identified by each evaluative framework available in Western Australia; b) which features were not identified and; c) how <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> differ as heuristic tools. <b>The</b> <b>frameworks</b> available for <b>the</b> study were the First Steps Writing Developmental Continuum, the Student Outcome Statements, the ESL Scales and the ESL Bandscales. Features of the student 2 ̆ 7 s writing were identified by descriptive analysis using <b>the</b> four evaluative <b>frameworks.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> evaluative <b>frameworks</b> identified a range of features of the student 2 ̆ 7 s writing, but some features were not identified by any framework. It was also found that there were differences between <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> as tools for evaluating and assessing the writing of an ESL child. It is suggested that, while {{the results of this study}} cannot be generalised to the ESL population at large, it seems that all of <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> used in this study could be used to identify many of the features of one ESL student 2 ̆ 7 s writing. However, it was found that for most of <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>the</b> features of the child 2 ̆ 7 s writing were distributed over several phases or stages. It was concluded that <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> may be useful for helping teachers identify features of ESL children 2 ̆ 7 s writing in order to plan appropriate learning activities (evaluation), but that using them for accountability (assessment) does not appear to be appropriate. Finally, it is suggested that <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> should be carefully chosen according to purpose and, where appropriate, should be modified to suit the needs of the school, teacher and student...|$|R

30|$|Students {{initially}} {{had different}} levels of experience in using <b>the</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Hence, a rival explanation could be that those students who were more familiar with <b>the</b> <b>frameworks</b> would rate their usability higher.

After three weeks into the assignment, the students’ previous experience was statistically significantly related to usability (r=. 48 **, p=. 002). After the assignment was completed, the students’ previous experience was no longer related to usability. Hence, in the early adoption phase, low experience was related to low experienced usability, but after more use, previous experience {{did not affect the}} evaluation.|$|R
