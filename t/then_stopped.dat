5|$|Starting in 1801, astronomers {{discovered}} Ceres {{and other}} bodies between Mars and Jupiter which were for decades {{considered to be}} planets. Between then and around 1851, {{when the number of}} planets had reached 23, astronomers started using the word asteroid for the smaller bodies and <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> naming or classifying them as planets.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 Swannell's company {{arrived at}} the foot of Baby 700, joining the seventy {{survivors}} of Robertson's and Lalor's companies. They immediately charged and chased the Turks back over the summit of Baby 700, <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> and dug in. The two 2nd Battalion companies arrived alongside them, but all the companies had taken casualties, among the dead being Swannell and Robertson.|$|E
5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in a rush of proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line and <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies were struggling to raise funding.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{stopping}} paradigms address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} stop certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective stopping. First, selective stopping may prolong the stop process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Second, selective stopping may involve <b>stopping</b> nonselectively and <b>then</b> restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (<b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate). We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to discriminate stop and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Our experiments focused on stimulus selective stopping, in which subjects stop to one signal and ignore another. When stop and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the <b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate strategy and others used the Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy. When stop signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the <b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discriminate strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than stop signals, most subjects used the Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy. The commonly accepted Independent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop</b> strategy was seldom implemented. Selective stopping was either not selective (<b>Stop</b> <b>then</b> Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent Discriminate <b>then</b> <b>Stop).</b> Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective stopping are discussed...|$|R
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife and two}} daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E
5|$|Between 1904 and 1905, Hull City {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Boulevard. This ground was used by Hull on a {{contract}} which allowed them to use it when not used for Rugby League, {{at a cost of}} £100 per annum. Hull built their own ground, Anlaby Road, which was opened in 1906. With the threat of the rerouting of the railway line through the Anlaby Road ground, the club was convinced it needed to secure its future by owning its own ground. They negotiated the deal for land between Boothferry Road and North Road in 1929, which was financed by a £3,000 loan from the FA. Due to the club's financial difficulties, no work took place for three years, and development <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> until 1939. In that year a proposal to build a new multi-purpose sports stadium on the site temporarily halted the club's plans to relocate, but when this plan failed the club resolved to continue with the stalled development of the site, in anticipation of moving to the new stadium in 1940. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the redevelopment again came to a halt, as the site was taken over by the Home Guard.|$|E

On the November 27 Raw, Torrie Wilson {{participated in a}} #1 Contenders Diva Battle Royal that was won by Victoria. On the December 11 Raw, Torrie was defeated by Victoria and after the match Chris Masters proceeded to put Torrie in a Masterlock until she was saved by Carlito. During this time, Ric Flair {{took an interest in}} Carlito, and Wilson accompanied the duo in a series of tag matches. On March 12 episode of Raw, Torrie was defeated by then Women's Champion Melina, after the match Melina attacked Wilson but was stopped by Mickie James, who was <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> by Victoria, Melina then attempted to escape but was stopped by Ashley Massaro. In May 2007, however, Carlito turned against Flair and dumped Wilson when he became a heel. The storyline came to a halt when on the June 11 episode of Raw, when Wilson was drafted from Raw to SmackDown! as part of the 2007 WWE Draft. As she returned, she acted a valet for Jimmy Wang Yang and the duo was placed in feuds against Victoria and Kenny Dykstra.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, the German {{high command}} {{recalled}} the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The fleet stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet {{to stop in}} Mahé, Seychelles to take on more coal. The fleet <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said. On 1 August they reached Cádiz, and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Heligoland, and on 11 August after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the Inspector General of the Navy. The following day, Geißler lowered his flag aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks.|$|E

5|$|When news {{began to}} spread of Henry I's death, Matilda and Geoffrey were in Anjou, {{supporting}} the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Nonetheless, Geoffrey and Matilda {{took the opportunity to}} march into southern Normandy and seize a number of key castles around Argentan that had formed Matilda's disputed dowry. They <b>then</b> <b>stopped,</b> unable to advance further, pillaging the countryside and facing increased resistance from the Norman nobility and a rebellion in Anjou itself. Matilda was by now also pregnant with her third son, William; opinions vary among historians as to what extent this affected her military plans.|$|E

5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{situation}} had calmed, the four battleships were sent to either Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Weissenburg went to Hong Kong, with the work lasting from 6 December 1900 to 3 January 1901. From 8 February to 23 March, she stopped in German Tsingtau, where she also conducted gunnery training. On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany.
