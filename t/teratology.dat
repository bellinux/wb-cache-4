5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of <b>teratology</b> (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E

40|$|International audienceContaminant-related {{stress on}} aquatic biota is {{difficult}} to assess when lethal impacts are not observed. Diatoms, by displaying deformities (<b>teratologies)</b> in their valves, {{have the potential to}} reflect sub-lethal responses to environmental stressors such as metals and organic compounds. For this reason, there is great interest in using diatom morphological aberrations in biomonitoring. However, the detection and mostly the quantification of <b>teratologies</b> is still a challenge; not all studies have succeeded in showing a relationship between the proportion of abnormal valves and contamination level along a gradient of exposure. This limitation in part reflects the loss of ecological information from diatom <b>teratologies</b> during analyses when all deformities are considered. The type of deformity, the severity of aberration, species proneness to deformity formation, and propagation of deformities throughout the population are key components and constraints in quantifying <b>teratologies.</b> Before a metric based on diatom deformities can be used as an indicator of contamination, it is important to better understand the “ecological signal” provided by this biomarker. Using the overall abundance of <b>teratologies</b> has proved to be an excellent tool for identifying contaminated and non-contaminated environments (presence/absence), but refining this biomonitoring approach may bring additional insights allowing for a better assessment of contamination level along a gradient. The dilemma: are all <b>teratologies</b> significant, equal and/or meaningful in assessing changing levels of contamination? This viewpoint article examines numerous interrogatives relative to the use of diatom <b>teratologies</b> in water quality monitoring, provides selected examples of differential responses to contamination, and proposes solutions that may refine our understanding and quantification of the stress. This paper highlights the logistical problems associated with accurately evaluating and interpreting <b>teratologies</b> and stimulates more discussion and research on the subject to enhance the sensitivity of this metric in bioassessments...|$|R

At the time it was collected, the gar was cruising leisurely in 22 °C water about 20 cm deep that was well shaded by erect smartweeds (Polygonum sp.). Its behavior was not erratic or atypical and its appearance, other than the jaw, was normal. The fish weighed 467 g and its total length was 545 mm.

40|$|The {{cytology}} {{and developmental}} attributes of 18 deficiency mutations in the 3 A 1 – 3 C 6 {{region of the}} salivary gland X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster have been investigated. The cytological limits of several older deficiencies have been revised and clarified and several new deficiencies are characterized. The deficiency mutants, with one possible exception, show a lethal phase in the late embryonic period or the early first larval instar. In contrast, the earliest acting point mutation lethals exposed by these deficiencies generally exhibit a somewhat later, post-embryonic lethality, perhaps indicating that the deficiencies are having some cumulative or synergistic impact on development. However, even with this difference in time of lethality, {{it is still possible}} to conclude {{that it is not the}} absolute size of the deficiency but rather the character of the loci deleted that determines the impact on development. Observations on the morphology of lethal embryos shows that while this analysis is internally consistent, it does not agree with earlier work. None of the 3 A 1 – 3 C 6 deficiencies causes any major <b>teratologies</b> during embryogenesis.

5000|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has focused}} {{for many years}} on cell death, a field that now boasts over 100,000 publications and is known also by the terms [...] "apoptosis" [...] and [...] "programmed cell death". First recognized in development (where does {{the tail of a}} metamorphosing tadpole go?), cell death is now considered to be a major component of development, homeostasis, aging, and many diseases. Some examples are:Most developmental abnormalities (<b>teratologies)</b> arise from excessive or insufficient cell death.In the developing central nervous system, as many as half of the newly-born cells die, with this death being essential for proper neural development.Many forms of cancer are failures of cells to die at the right time.At least half of the cells that die in a heart attack could be salvaged if we knew how to control cell death.A major approach in treating AIDS is to limit the death of the T-cells (most of which are not infected with virus but rather are induced to commit suicide), andAlzheimer's Disease is inherently a problem of cell death.We have looked for many years at signaling mechanisms inducing cells to die as well as the proteases that take the cells apart and may be the killing mechanism. Currently we focus on two major directions: Proteases other than caspases (proteases with very restricted substrate specificity that are the major proteases in apoptosis) and the acquisition by an embryo of the ability to undergo apoptosis. These studies have taken us, including many students, to many countries including (2000-2002) Canada, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Australia.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{criminalisation}} is predominantly motivated by rational responses to norm violations {{has been a}} familiar position within legal theory, one which has diverted attention away from some more irrational impulses which often drive it. In this paper I consider one set of impulses of this kind - law constructed as responses to what I term the abnormal - a complex social constant which, I argue, produces effects that are substantively distinct from those generated by negated norms. Tracing contemporary legal attitudes towards the abnormal from within premodern regulatory responses to the construct of the ‘monster’, I evaluate the role of scientific discourse in reconstituting the monstrous {{in terms of the}} more socially acceptable trope of abnormality. I examine the long standing role of abnormalities as a predictor for risk, especially within criminal justice - from the notorious Lombrosian project of correlating biological abnormalities with criminality through to contemporary programmes of criminal profiling and the search for correlations between brain abnormalities and criminality. Setting Foucaults account of the ‘human monster’ and its legal impacts beside Garlands criminology of the ‘other’ I then attempt to set out a more systematic ‘hermeneutics of the other’ {{in the form of a}} ‘teratology’ – a social parallel to the discipline within medical science which gives it its name. I argue that in making our <b>teratologies</b> transparent we clarify their often negative impacts upon the production of criminal law – in particular a kind of ‘monstrous doubling’ effect, where the anomalousness (seemingly) threatened by the abnormal becomes, in turn, legal anomaly. Not only do such effects subvert the rational management of harm into programmes of distorted or excessive law production. At their most extreme they can sometimes generate what Richard Ericsson has termed ‘counterlaw’ - laws against law, where abnormal circumstances seem to necessitate abnormal - that is, extra legal - responses. I conclude by suggesting that one contribution of a ‘teratological stance’ to any normative theory of criminalisation might be to refine our understanding of how law is structured in the face of imagined offence, rather than substantive wrongdoing...|$|R

40|$|O estudo geoquímico e biológico realizado na bacia hidrográfica do rio Caima permitiu a identificação e a avaliação dos impactos ambientais nesta bacia hidrográfica com {{particular}} ênfase nas áreas envolventes de antigas áreas mineiras. Nestas áreas foram detectadas concentrações elevadas em Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu e Fe nos sedimentos de corrente e em Pb e Zn nas águas de superfície (especialmente no período do Outono). Uma avaliação completa da qualidade do meio aquático foi estabelecida a partir da associação de índices geoquímicos (Índice de Contaminação-IC) com índices biológicos (Índice de Poluossensibilidade Específica-IPS e o Índice Biológico Diatómico-IBD). The {{main purpose}} of the geochemical and biological study was the identification and assessment of the possible environmental impacts in the hydrographical basin of Caima and Mau rivers, with special emphasis on the areas surrounding old mines of Pb, Cd and Zn. Data from stream sediment samples (minus 80 mesh fraction) were used to undertake a preliminary delimitation {{of the extent of}} contamination from Coval da Mó, Palhal and Braçal mines. The chemical data, particularly Pb, Cd and Zn concentrations, reveal that significant environmental contamination occurs {{in the vicinity of the}} abandoned mines. The presence of tailing deposits is identified as the main source of Pb, Cd and Zn in the area. Extremely high Pb (3303 mg kg- 1) and Cd (18. 5 mg kg- 1) concentrations were observed in stream sediments collected in the Corga do Coval da Mó and Mau streams as a result of the surface runoff. A decreasing metal gradient was observed from Corga do Coval da Mó stream down to the Caima river. In order to study the effects of anthropogenic contaminants and other environmental variables on the taxonomic composition, structure and morphological changes of benthic diatom communities within a former mining area (Coval da Mó), 20 sites were selected in the Caima and Mau river basins. At the mining area, in the Corga do Coval da Mó stream, diatoms were extremely rare. Two km downstream low abundance and diversity of diatom taxa indicated a stressed environment. There, especially, Fragilaria capucina var. rumpens but also Fragilaria crotonensis and Achnanthidium minutissimum showed abnormal valves which may be related to the high levels of metals in this area. Six km downstream in Fílvida mainstream, an increase in species richness and diversity was registered while the relative percentage of <b>teratologies</b> was lower. Available data on water chemistry suggest that the diatom community patterns are mostly justified by the metal contamination, because nutrients and organic matter revealed low concentrations, and acidification did not occur. The levels obtained for heavy metal concentration in sediments (in particular Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and Fe) and those obtained for superficial waters (Pb and Zn only in autumn), showed the existence of contamination in the surroundings of industrial and abandoned mining areas. A more reliable interpretation of the collected data and a more complete assessment of the water quality were made possible by the association of geochemical indices (CI – Contamination Index) and biological indices SPI - Specific Pollution Sensitivity and BDI – Biological Diatom Index).
