5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{suspicions that}} other agents, {{including}} Angelo Lano, had been {{speaking to the}} Post, in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> that he had sources, which he declined to name, confirming Felt was speaking to the press.|$|E

Meier <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> brother, Donald, that he was sure the Democrats would win the election since they had a lot of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released, and that Larry O’Brien had the information. Donald then told his brother that Meier had given the Democrats all the Hughes information that could destroy him, leading to the subsequent Watergate burglary.|$|R

25|$|In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt {{accompanied}} Muir on a {{visit to}} Yosemite. Muir joined Roosevelt in Oakland, California, for the train trip to Raymond. The presidential entourage then traveled by stagecoach into the park. While traveling to the park, Muir <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> about state mismanagement of the valley and rampant exploitation of the valley's resources. Even before they entered the park, he was able to convince Roosevelt {{that the best way to}} protect the valley was through federal control and management.|$|E
25|$|The downing of {{the flight}} had {{resulted}} {{in the death of}} 38 Australian citizens and residents. In the lead up to the 2014 G20 meeting in Brisbane, Tony Abbott sought to focus attention on Russia's role in the shooting. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the APEC meeting in Beijing, Abbott reportedly <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> that Australia had information that the missile that destroyed the plane had Russian origin and that Russia should consider apologising and offering appropriate restitution to the victims of the shooting. Russia continued to deny involvement.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain {{impeachment}} when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.|$|E
50|$|The {{sightings}} of July 26-27 also made front-page headlines, and led President Harry Truman {{to have his}} air force aide call Ruppelt and {{ask for an explanation}} of the sightings and unknown radar returns. Truman listened to the conversation between the two men on a separate phone, but did not ask questions himself. Ruppelt, remembering the conversation he had with Captain James, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> assistant that <b>the</b> sightings might have been caused by a temperature inversion, in which a layer of warm, moist air covers a layer of cool, dry air closer to the ground. This condition can cause radar signals to bend and give false returns. However, Ruppelt had not yet interviewed any of the witnesses or conducted a formal investigation.|$|R

50|$|Sinclair, {{talking with}} Sen. Hidoshi, wonders if Capt. Pierce's mission goes against Sinclair's authority, solely given by <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> having final {{jurisdiction}} over the sector. Sinclair claims that unless <b>told</b> by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> himself, he is still {{in command of the}} sector and has final say on any matter. Hidoshi tries to compromise by getting Sinclair to share the authority with Pierce, which Sinclair strongly objects to.|$|R
25|$|On {{learning}} that officer José Víctor Zavala {{had been appointed}} as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City {{that they would have}} to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.|$|E
500|$|The revolt started {{shortly after}} the brutal 250 lashes given to Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes, a regular Afro-Brazilian enlisted sailor, for {{deliberately}} injuring a fellow seaman with a shaving razor. There is some scholarly disagreement on if this number is correct and exactly when this sentence was carried out, but all agree {{that it was the}} immediate catalyst. A later Brazilian government observer, former navy captain José Carlos de Carvalho, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of Brazil that Menezes' back looked like [...] "a mullet sliced open for salting." ...|$|E
500|$|Through late 1897 {{and early}} 1898, many Americans {{called for the}} United States to {{intervene}} in Cuba, then a Spanish colony revolting against the mother country. These calls greatly increased in February 1898, when the American battleship [...] Maine sank in Havana harbor after an explosion. McKinley sought delay, hoping to settle the disputes peacefully, but in April 1898, Hobart <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that the Senate would act against Spain whether McKinley liked it or not. McKinley gave in; Congress declared war on April 25, beginning the Spanish–American War, and Hobart sent McKinley a pen with which to sign the declaration.|$|E

5000|$|Bush {{was criticized}} for not {{returning}} to Washington, D.C. from his vacation in Texas until after Wednesday afternoon, {{more than a day}} after the hurricane hit on Monday. On the morning of August 28, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> telephoned Mayor Nagin to [...] "plead" [...] for a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, and Nagin and Gov.

500|$|Even {{with support}} diminished by the {{continuing}} series of revelations, Nixon hoped {{to fight the}} charges. However, {{one of the new}} tapes, recorded soon after the break-in, demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation. In a statement accompanying the release of {{what became known as the}} [...] "Smoking Gun Tape" [...] on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory. Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott, Senator Barry Goldwater, and House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon soon after. [...] Rhodes told Nixon that he faced certain impeachment in the House. [...] Scott and Goldwater <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> that he had, at most, only 15 votes in his favor in the Senate— far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office.|$|E

2500|$|Although LeMay <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that he {{considered}} {{the resolution of the}} crisis the [...] "greatest defeat in our history", his was a minority position. He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.

50|$|However, {{the next}} day, Barnes was summoned {{back to the}} White House and <b>told</b> by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> that Mrs. Lincoln had decided to {{accompany}} him to City Point.

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement."

2500|$|Vatican dress {{codes for}} both men and women were relaxed early in Pope John Paul II's pontificate. While most female royalty voluntarily abide by the {{traditional}} dress code (black dress, mantilla) most female republican heads of state or First Ladies do not. Raisa Gorbachova wore red. Robinson's dark green outfit had been judged perfectly acceptable by the Vatican, whereas earlier presidents of Ireland, notably Éamon de Valera in the 1960s (see image), were required by Vatican protocol to wear white tie and decorations (honours), the male equivalent of the traditional black dress and manilla. Robinson's immediate predecessor, Patrick Hillery, was also allowed to wear less formal attire. In his case, Hillery wore a lounge suit for his April 1989 visit. When Taoiseach Bertie Ahern wore the traditional white tie to the ceremony raising the Archbishop of Dublin to the cardinate, he found himself to be only guest wearing it. All the other official guests without exception had worn lounge suits. According to The Examiner when Robinson's successor, Mary McAleese visited the Pope [...] "the Vatican had earlier <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> advisers that a traditional lace mantilla was not a requirement." ...|$|R
