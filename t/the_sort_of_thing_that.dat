According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Sacre, whose {{character}} was {{directly involved in}} the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: [...] "I think the fact that it's <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed. Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life." ...|$|E
500|$|John Banville wrote {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} book for The New York Review of Books. He {{described}} Saturday as <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> a committee directed to produce a 'novel of our time' would write, the politics were [...] "banal"; the tone arrogant, self-satisfied and incompetent; the characters cardboard cut-outs. He felt McEwan strove too hard to display technical knowledge [...] "and his ability to put that knowledge into good, clean prose".|$|E

That doesn't prevent his chief trait being verbal exactitude.

500|$|Brownlee {{wanted to}} call an {{election}} in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta's natural resources, but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus. [...] Taking advantage of a period of increased popularity to call an early election was considered immoral {{by many in the}} UFA, <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the old-style parties might try but which the UFA had been elected to hold itself above. [...] As such, an election was not held until June 19, 1930, four years less nine days after the previous one.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} of the Ninja Gaiden series, Eurogamer said that Ninja GaidenIII {{was the only}} game in the NES trilogy not to make it to Europe. They made similar criticisms about the difficulty level, saying that the North American version was made more difficult than the Japanese version by utilizing limited continues, making the enemies much more powerful, and removing the password system present in the Japanese version. They said the story was too outlandish, calling the plot, of which a short-lived anime Ninja Gaiden series would loosely be based, [...] "a glorious load of old bollocks". While the version from Ninja Gaiden Trilogy for the Super NES remedied most of their criticisms, they said that the game added new frustrations which included slower framerates, lower-quality controls, and the omission and shuffling around of several tracks, which they said [...] "is precisely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes die-hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage".|$|E
500|$|Although it {{enjoyed a}} degree of {{commercial}} success, the album received mixed reviews. Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cripps {{was unhappy}} with the British black {{propaganda}} campaign against Germany. When Cripps discovered what Sefton Delmer was involved with (through the intervention of Richard Crossman) he wrote to Anthony Eden, then Foreign Secretary: [...] "If this is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is needed to win the war, why, I'd rather lose it." [...] Delmer was defended by Robert Bruce Lockhart who pointed out the need to reach the sadist in the German nature.|$|E
2500|$|The New Statesman {{observed}} that Brown successfully describes [...] "the awkwardness of the lifestyle" [...] and [...] "the vagueness of the position", and that while [...] "political events and {{what must have}} been some fairly traumatic personal moments" [...] seem [...] "airbrushed", leaving [...] "the diary feeling a little empty", the book demonstrates how [...] "collision of the political with the personal... jars and is sometimes funny", concluding it is full of [...] "thoughtfulness and... courtesy", [...] "precisely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is genuine Sarah Brown".|$|E

[...] They continued to call her voice [...] "an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap." [...] In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote [...] "unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Russell, a {{denoting}} {{phrase is}} a singular noun phrase, {{preceded by a}} quantifier, whose predicate term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas Frege held {{that there were two}} distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its Sinn and Bedeutung), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (Sinn) and replaces it {{with the idea of a}} propositional function (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he had in mind: [...] "a man, any man, every man, the present King of France... the centre of mass of the Solar System, ...." [...] So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article [...] "the" [...] at the beginning), which [...] "does not denote anything" [...] (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes [...] "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not referring expressions but rather, to borrow a term later coined by Keith Donnellan, they have [...] "attributive" [...] uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are [...] "general" [...] in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.|$|E
