5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and because Belgium and France are not part of the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls.

25|$|The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland {{were the}} only EU members which, prior to the 2004 enlargement, had not signed the Schengen Agreement. Both {{countries}} maintain a Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> with passport-free travel for their citizens {{between them and the}} three British Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, that are outside the European Union.

25|$|Prior to post-World War II, {{both states}} {{mutually}} recognised each other's entry visas for foreigners. However, in 1952 changes to UK law rescinded this arrangement.

25|$|Most {{transport}} operators permit {{passengers to}} travel within the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> without a passport, although Ryanair require all passengers {{to carry a}} passport or a national identity card. In 2014 a private member's bill was put before the Irish parliament which proposed to prohibit transport operators from requiring {{the production of a}} passport for travel within the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> but it was not passed. Photo ID is required for Irish or British citizens travelling by air at the minimum. The Irish government in October 2015, started issuing passport cards and are the same size as national identity cards from other EU countries, which are accepted by all transport operators but the issuing of a passport card requires the holder to already have a conventional passport book.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{has been}} a member state of the European Union since 1973, but has chosen to remain outside the Schengen Area. Citizens of the United Kingdom can freely enter the country without a {{passport}} due to the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> which is a passport-free zone comprising the islands of Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

Other nationalities and those holding non-qualifying visas still require separate visas to visit both countries and may not avail of a transit visa exception if wishing to transit though the UK to Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Eurostar has higher {{security}} measures than other TGVs. Luggage is screened and passengers {{are required to}} check in 30minutes before departure. Because the UK {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area, and because France and Belgium are not part of the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area,</b> passengers are subject to immigration checks. These take place before passengers board the train, so officials from the UK Border Force are stationed in France and Belgium, with their French counterparts stationed in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{living in}} the country, and {{visitors}} to Ireland who hold a European Health Insurance Card, are entitled to use the public healthcare system.

Outpatient services are also provided without charge. The majority of patients on median incomes or above are required to pay subsidised hospital charges.|$|E

25|$|The UK {{has some}} opt-outs from EU policies. One is the opt-out from the Schengen Area, meaning there are full {{passport}} checks for travellers from other EU countries except the Republic of Ireland, {{which is part}} of the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> (CTA) with the UK. The Scottish government proposed that an independent Scotland should remain outside the Schengen Area and join the CTA, ensuring that no passport controls would be needed at the Anglo-Scottish border. Nicola Sturgeon commented that an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU to have the same visa arrangements as the UK has.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, five {{member states}} of the then European Economic Community signed the Schengen Agreement on the gradual {{dropping}} of border controls between them. This treaty and the implementation convention of 1990 {{paved the way for}} the creation of the Schengen Area. Implemented in 1995, by 1997 all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement. The Amsterdam Treaty, which was drafted that year, incorporated Schengen into EU law, while giving Ireland and the UK an opt-out permitting them to maintain systematic passport and immigration controls at their frontiers. The wording of the treaty makes Ireland's opt-out from eliminating border controls conditional on the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> being maintained.|$|E
25|$|Ireland and the United Kingdom are {{the only}} parts of the European Union not obliged to join the Schengen free-travel area. The Crown Dependencies, which are outside of the EU, are not members either. Instead, a Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> exists between the two states and the Crown Dependencies. The Common Travel Areas is not founded on any formal {{agreement}} between Ireland and the United Kingdom and is not provided for in legislation. Instead, it is an informal arrangement between the states. When the Schengen Area was incorporated into the European Union through the 1992 Amsterdam Treaty, the first formal recognition of the Common Travel areas was made though an annexed protocol exempting their obligations to join.|$|E

Switzerland was subsequently allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011.

25|$|Today, Irish and British {{citizens}} are accorded equivalent reciprocal rights and entitlements (with {{a small number}} of minor exceptions) and a Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> exists between Ireland, United Kingdom, and the Crown Dependencies. The British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference acts as an official forum for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on matters of mutual interest generally, and with respect to Northern Ireland in particular. Two other bodies, the British–Irish Council and the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly act as a forum for discussion between the executives and assemblies, respectively, of the region, including the devolved regions in the UK and the three Crown dependencies. Co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including the execution of common policies in certain areas, occurs through the North/South Ministerial Council. In 2014, the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny described {{the relationship between the two}} countries as being at 'an all time high'.|$|E
25|$|According to the Home Office, {{he arrived}} in Britain on 13 March 2002, on a six-month visitor's visa. After its expiry, he applied to stay on as a student, and was granted {{permission}} to remain until 30 June 2003. The Home Office said it had no record of any further correspondence, but added: 'We have seen a copy of Mr Menezes' passport, containing a stamp apparently giving him indefinite leave {{to remain in the}} UK. On investigation, this stamp was not one that was in use by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on the date given.' This was denied by the family of Menezes; and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that he believed Menezes was living in the UK legally, but had no precise information to confirm this. Immigration records show that Menezes entered the Republic of Ireland from France on 23 April 2005. There are no records to show the exact date that he returned to the UK; however, under the Common <b>Travel</b> <b>Area</b> system, a foreign citizen entering the UK through the Republic of Ireland has an automatic right to remain for three months. Therefore, Menezes was lawfully in the UK on the day he was killed, even if the stamp in his passport recording indefinite leave to remain had been a forgery.|$|E
