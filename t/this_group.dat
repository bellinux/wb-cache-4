5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within <b>this</b> <b>group</b> form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place <b>this</b> <b>group</b> of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize <b>this</b> <b>group</b> as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E

5|$|After the war, it was {{estimated}} that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived. An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the Dutch underground. Approximately two-thirds of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> survived the war.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is {{an effect of}} the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|All {{ethnic groups}} speak Bulgarian, {{either as a}} first or as a second {{language}}. Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85.2 percent of the population. The oldest written Slavic language, Bulgarian is distinguishable from the other languages in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of noun cases and infinitives, and a suffixed definite article.|$|E

5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> so the membership remains uncertain. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|Calbovista {{is usually}} {{classified}} in the family Lycoperdaceae, although the nomenclatural status of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> is unclear, as some authorities lump it into the Agaricaceae. By contrast, Sanford Myron Zeller placed Calbovista in Mycenastracae, a family erected by him in 1948 to contain Calbovista and Mycenastrum, two genera united by similarities in capillitial morphology. Mycenastraceae is not currently considered to have independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae.|$|E
