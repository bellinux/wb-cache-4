500|$|The {{head and}} arm {{had been built}} with {{assistance}} from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier. The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel and his structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron <b>truss</b> <b>tower.</b> Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton {{was attached to the}} center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a mesh of metal straps, known as [...] "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually. To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of incorporating semiactive friction dampers into wind-excited large <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> to abate excessive vibration. Piezoelectric materials are used to control the clamping force of a friction damper so as to regulate the slip force of the damper through simple feedback of damper motion status. A rational analytical method is then developed for determining wind-induced dynamic response of large <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> equipped with semiactive friction dampers and performing extensive parametric studies to evaluate their effectiveness. The proposed bimodel method fulfills the task by alternatively using a 3 D finite-element static model and a 2 D lumped mass dynamic model. Finally, the bimodel and semiactive friction dampers are applied to a large space steel television tower as a case study. The study demonstrates that the bimodel method can efficiently compute wind-induced dynamic response of the television tower with semiactive friction dampers. The semiactive friction dampers can effectively suppress not only excessive displacement response but also velocity and acceleration responses. Compared with passive friction dampers, the semiactive friction dampers are more robust and versatile for enhancing both serviceability and strength performances of the tower.

5000|$|On January 22, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for severe weather across {{parts of the}} Southern United States and Ohio Valley. Late that afternoon, a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued for much of Arkansas and parts of Tennessee and Mississippi. At sunset, multiple discrete supercell thunderstorms developed over Arkansas and began producing significant tornadoes. An EF2 tornado impacted the northwestern fringes of Fordyce, Arkansas, damaging or destroying multiple homes, collapsing metal <b>truss</b> <b>towers,</b> and heavily damaging a local country club. Another EF2 near Sweden, Arkansas severely damaged a metal building, a radio tower, large grain bins, vehicles, and farm machinery. Two separate tornadoes, rated EF2 and EF1, caused considerable damage to metal <b>truss</b> <b>towers,</b> outbuildings, trees, and power poles near De Witt. Further to the east, multiple mobile homes were destroyed by an EF2 tornado near Alligator, Mississippi. While much of this outbreak was centered across the deep south, several tornadoes touched down further to the north as well. This included an EF2 that touched down near Enfield, Illinois and destroyed many barns, outbuildings, and garages along its path, {{as well as a}} communications tower. An EF1 caused moderate damage in the town of Hazel, Kentucky as well. Further south, the storms pushed eastward and grew upscale into and organized squall line around midnight.|$|R
50|$|A violent EF4 wedge tornado {{produced}} catastrophic damage as it impacted {{the outskirts}} of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province, China {{on the afternoon of}} June 23. Thousands of masonry construction homes were destroyed, many of which were leveled. Trees were debarked, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and metal power line pylons and <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> were bent to the ground. Schools and manufacturing plants sustained major damage as well. 99 people were killed and 846 others were injured, many of them critically. The tornado traveled approximately 33 km from Banhuzhen to Wutanzhen, with a maximum width of about 4.5 km.|$|R

50|$|Adjacent to {{the larger}} Equinox Mountains is Little Equinox, where two wind farms have {{previously}} operated. One wind turbine was installed in 1981 and three more in 1982, making Little Equinox Mountain the site {{of one of the}} first wind farms in the United States. These turbines, an early-generation design by WTG Systems of Buffalo, New York, were mounted on 80 ft <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> and had a nominal peak output of 350 kW. The turbines, however, were plagued with mechanical issues, and by the mid-1980s all four were out of service, standing idle on the mountain from 1985 through 1989.|$|R
500|$|Powerful tornadoes {{touched down}} across Tennessee {{as well that}} evening. A violent EF4 struck the {{community}} of New Harmony, Tennessee, where homes were leveled, vehicles were tossed, and four people were killed. Two EF3 tornadoes crossed paths in Greene and Washington counties (coming a couple hours apart), resulting in eight fatalities. The rural communities of Horse Creek and Camp Creek suffered major damage from those tornadoes late that evening. A very large EF4 wedge tornado leveled a mile-wide swath of forest through [...] of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At Chilhowee Lake, large metal power line <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> were torn and thrown from their concrete supports that they were anchored to.|$|R
50|$|The lifting design utilises {{four white}} tubular steel space <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> with {{concrete}} counterweights mounted internally on red carriers, although early plans envisioned spherical counterweights. These are suspended by cable over large grey wheels, mounted above decorative triangular maintenance platforms. The counterbalancing system allows {{the bridge to}} complete a raising or lowering through its 18-metre lift {{in less than three}} minutes. The outermost truss sections of each tower curve away from the main bridge at the base, tapering to a point, and each tower is topped with two decorative blue lights. The four towers have uplighting from the maintenance platform, although this feature has not been operational for some time.|$|R

50|$|A {{localized}} {{outbreak of}} 15 tornadoes impacted Southern United States on February 7. A {{few of these}} tornadoes were strong, with the most significant damage occurring in Louisiana. A large EF2 wedge tornado destroyed homes near Killian, Louisiana. An EF1 tornado caused considerable damage {{in the town of}} Donaldsonville, killing one person. A large, damaging tornado of EF3 intensity ripped through portions of Eastern New Orleans, damaging or destroying numerous homes, businesses, and industrial buildings. Another EF3 tornado near Watson toppled metal <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> and destroyed manufactured homes. At least 33 people were injured by the New Orleans tornado with up to 6 being serious. An EF2 tornado also damaged multiple homes and destroyed a flea market near Harperville, Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|The large, {{wedge-shaped}} tornado {{carved a}} wide path of destruction through Funing and Sheyang counties in Jiangsu province, leaving behind catastrophic damage as it impacted {{the outskirts of}} Yancheng. Wind speeds of up to 125 km/h were measured {{at the edge of}} the city. Thousands of masonry-construction homes were damaged or destroyed, with many completely leveled. Manufacturing plants, businesses, and rice mills suffered from similar destruction, and multiple large factory buildings were severely damaged at a Canadian Solar plant. A large school building sustained major structural damage as well. Many vehicles were tossed and destroyed; trees were completely denuded and debarked; and numerous metal power line pylons and <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> were bent and crumpled to the ground.

The knowledge stored in the graph representations of diagrams is translated into first-order logic formulas which describe generated design configurations. A proposed logic-based reasoning mechanism allows the design supporting system to check the compatibility of designs with the given requirements and constraints. The approach is illustrated by examples of designing configurations of transmission <b>truss</b> <b>towers...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The New Orleans tornado {{was part}} of a small {{outbreak}} of tornadoes that impacted the Southern United States on February 7, a few of which were strong. This included an EF3 near Watson, Louisiana that toppled a metal <b>truss</b> <b>tower,</b> badly damaged a metal building, and destroyed manufactured homes. An EF1 struck the town of Donaldsonville, causing considerable damage to structures and killing one person. A large EF2 wedge tornado that passed near Killian and Akers downed many trees and destroyed small house built on a cinder block foundation. Another EF2 destroyed a flea market near Harperville, Mississippi as well. A total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|NASA {{contracted}} with General Electric in 1978 {{to scale up}} from the MOD-0A with a 10-fold increase in power. The Mod-1 was the first wind turbine {{in the world to}} produce 2 megawatts and also General Electric's first wind turbine. The Danish :da:Vindkraftv√¶rket Tvindkraft with a hub height of 46 meters above the ground, a larger rotor and a rating at a higher wind speed, had a capacity of 2000 kW but never achieved 2 MW power output of the Mod-1. The Mod-1's design weight prevented it from becoming a competitive commercial product, but a prototype was installed and run at Howard's Knob near Boone, North Carolina. The quick design cycle to multi-megawatt size based on the first generation Mod-0 caused technical and operational challenges. Low-frequency noise from the heavy <b>truss</b> <b>tower</b> blocking the wind to the downwind rotor caused problems to residences located close by. With additional pressure of a reduction in federal program funding, the turbine was dismantled in 1983.|$|E
50|$|The initial MOD-0 blades {{were made}} by Lockheed, out of aluminum. Structural {{problems}} surfaced almost immediately at the root end of the blades. Several significant changes and efforts were performed to address this. An investigation revealed that unexpectedly high cyclic loads {{were the result of}} a significant blockage of the wind by the complex <b>truss</b> <b>tower</b> structure. This caused the aerodynamic loads on the downwind rotor rapidly change. To correct this blockage, the access stairs were removed {{from the center of the}} tower. A major blade material program was started that assessed fiberglass composite, steel, wood and even concrete. NASA approached the Gougeon Brothers, Inc. of Michigan to apply their boat material technology to wind turbines. The resulting wood and composite blades replaced the aluminum blades on th Mod-0 (and later Mod-0A), eliminating the blade root structural problems. Gougeon Brothers successfully commercialized their products into the wind turbine industry with sales around the world.|$|E
50|$|An EF4 tornado {{impacted}} {{areas in}} and around the towns of Pianiga, Dolo and Mira, causing major damage and several casualties within the Riviera del Brenta region of Italy, famous for its villas and channels. About 500 buildings were badly damaged or destroyed, and among them was the large, two-story, masonry construction Villa Fini restaurant and hotel from the 17th century, which was almost entirely leveled to the ground. Many trees were defoliated, snapped, and partially debarked, and numerous cars were tossed and damaged, a few of which were thrown into canals and submerged. As the tornado impacted rural areas, farmsteads were severely damaged, metal high-tension <b>truss</b> <b>towers</b> were toppled to the ground, and agricultural fields were scoured.

50|$|The fifth tornado {{spawned by}} this {{supercell}} touched {{down as the}} main Pilger tornado was dissipating. This large wedge tornado quickly reached EF4 strength soon after touching down, moving east as it cleanly swept away a farm home. Further east, a large metal electrical transmission <b>truss</b> <b>tower</b> was toppled at EF3 intensity. The main Pilger tornado was seen roping out and rotating {{around the perimeter of}} this new tornado as it developed. The tornado then weakened somewhat as it veered sharply to the north, destroying outbuildings and toppling power poles at EF2 intensity. Continuing due-north, the tornado maintained EF2 strength as it tore roofs off of multiple homes and destroyed numerous barns and outbuildings. The tornado then re-strengthened to EF4 intensity as it crossed 854th Rd, sweeping away several farm homes at that location and debarking multiple trees. The tornado then weakened back to EF2 strength and became rain-wrapped as it passed east of Wakefield, destroying outbuildings, snapping trees and power poles, and tearing roofs off of homes at EF1 to EF2 strength before dissipating north of town. After the Wakefield tornado dissipated, the supercell continued to the northeast, producing a sixth and final EF0 tornado that briefly touched down in an open field near the town of Hubbard, causing no damage.|$|E
50|$|On May 10, 2015, {{shortly after}} sunset, Van {{was struck by}} a strong tornado during the May 5-10, 2015 tornado {{outbreak}} sequence. According to the National Weather Service and Tornado chasers, a severe thunderstorm spawned a Tornado that touched down in a heavily wooded thicket just south of Van Zandt County Road 4609, just west of the small community of Primrose, 10 miles south of Van. The Tornado path moved in a direct line north, crossing Texas State Highway 64, picking up strength as it crossed the Neches River, and then Interstate 20 just south of the town. The tornado went straight into the heart of Van, causing heavy damage to structures in the town. It destroyed the elementary school in the city that was a historical monument and then moved straight north through residential neighborhoods, destroying homes and causing massive structural damage. The tornado continued in a straight line north towards Grand Saline. The tornado dissipated 3.5 miles north of Van. Numerous homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed, and many trees and power lines were downed throughout Van. A nearby metal-frame industrial building was destroyed. A few well-built frame homes {{in the northern part of}} town were left with only interior walls standing. An oil pump derrick toppled to the ground, along with a large metal high-tension <b>truss</b> <b>tower.</b> Several barns and outbuildings were destroyed as well. Two people were killed and 47 were injured, prompting local emergency management officials to declare a mass-casualty incident. The following day, the tornado was given a rating of EF3 from the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{observation}} deck on the Telemax. The building is of architectural interest {{due to its}} square surfaces. In 1997, Boeckler received cement-steel prize Die Kunst des Bewehrens for the <b>tower's</b> <b>truss</b> structure.|$|R
50|$|A {{moderate}} {{outbreak of}} mostly weak tornadoes impacted the Ohio Valley region beginning {{on the evening}} of June 22, and continuing into {{the early morning hours of}} June 23. Most of the tornadoes occurred in Illinois. An EF1 tornado struck the town of Troy Grove, Illinois, downing numerous trees and tree limbs throughout town. Another EF1 struck the northeastern part of Cissna Park, damaging trees, power poles, homes, outbuildings, and a baseball dugout. Near Seneca, an EF2 tornado crumpled four metal <b>truss</b> <b>towers,</b> damaged homes, and destroyed outbuildings. Another EF2 tornado clipped the southwestern edge of Pontiac, heavily damaging a few businesses, snapping power poles, destroying a mobile home, and injuring four people. Significant tornado activity pushed into Indiana early the next morning, with an EF1 and an EF2 tornado causing structural damage to homes and destroying outbuildings near Huntington. In Ohio, a long-track EF1 tornado touched down in Waynesville before lifting in Wilmington, damaging trees, homes, outbuildings, and a convenience store along its path. Overall this outbreak produced 23 tornadoes and no deaths.|$|R
50|$|Maintaining EF2 intensity, {{the storm}} struck another small {{community}} at 8:19 p.m. CDT (0119 UTC). Here, mobile homes were blown off their foundations and completely destroyed. Some {{of the homes}} rolled up to 50 yd before coming to a rest. At 8:22 p.m. CDT (0122 UTC), the tornado regained EF3 strength and toppled several metal high-tension <b>truss</b> <b>towers.</b> Two nearby homes were pushed completely off of their foundations. More noticeable weakening took place thereafter, with subsequent damage not exceeding EF1 levels. The tornado crossed U.S. Route 64 around 8:25 p.m. CDT (0125 UTC) as it caused widespread tree damage. Although it had weakened, the tornado broadened to a width of 500 yd. Turning north-northeast, the storm crossed into southern Moore County, Tennessee several minutes later. Damage was mostly confined to trees, though several barns and a few single-family homes sustained moderate roof damage. The tornado ultimately dissipated at 8:33 p.m. CDT (0133 UTC) roughly 3 mi southeast of Lynchburg. Overall, the tornado remained {{on the ground for}} 24 minutes and traveled 20.1 mi, killing two people along the way.|$|R
