5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves Miles per Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs. As the trains will <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> in the depot less, {{it will allow}} South West Trains to acquire additional rolling stock without the {{need to build a}} new depot.|$|E
5|$|Forks Road, a river road {{following}} Forks Creek, {{served to}} connect the Grand River at Dunnville with the Welland River west of Welland. Like many early roads in Upper Canada, it was built along a river bank. It can <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> assumed that this trail was built prior to {{the completion of the}} Feeder Canal in 1832.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Warren Jeffs {{was convicted}} in Texas on sexual assault charges {{unrelated}} to Wall's case and {{sentenced to life in}} prison plus 20 years. Since Warren Jeffs would <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> 100 years old by the earliest time he could be released from prison, Utah decided to drop the retrial.|$|E
5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E

5000|$|Radiolarite is a {{very hard}} rock and <b>therefore</b> <b>was</b> {{extensively}} used by stone-age man for tools and weapons. Radiolarite has <b>therefore</b> <b>been</b> called the [...] "iron of the Paleolithic". Axes, blades, drills and scrapers were manufactured from it. The cutting edges of these tools, however, are somewhat less sharp than flint.|$|R
5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in storage facilities do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will be especially efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged and are still developing in the seeds. Early harvest could <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor {{that has a}} left adjoint (and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> a right adjoint) is continuous (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right adjoint (and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> a left adjoint) is cocontinuous (i.e. commutes with colimits).|$|R
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the Western Electric crossbar systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and <b>therefore</b> <b>were</b> highly fault resistant. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and <b>therefore</b> <b>were</b> not fault tolerant.|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> recommended to abort an attack.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow {{can be caused by}} the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may <b>therefore</b> <b>be</b> effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
