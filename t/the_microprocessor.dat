5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E
25|$|The signal {{processing}} is performed by <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> {{in real time}} and {{taking into account the}} individual preferences of the user (for example, increasing bass for better speech perception in noisy environments, or selective amplification of high frequencies for people with reduced sensibility to this range). <b>The</b> <b>microprocessor</b> automatically analyzes the nature of the external background noise and adapts the {{signal processing}} to the specific conditions (as well as to its change, for example, when the user goes outside from the building).|$|E

50|$|In 2008, in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., the Supreme Court {{held that}} the sale of {{patented}} <b>microprocessors</b> exhausted <b>the</b> patent monopoly on <b>the</b> <b>microprocessors</b> and also as to patents covering the combination of <b>the</b> patented <b>microprocessors</b> with other electronic components, where (as in Univis) the essential features of the invention were all contained in <b>the</b> <b>microprocessors,</b> i.e., <b>the</b> sold article embodies the essential features of the patented invention. In this case, Quanta's primary patents were on microprocessors, but it also had patents on products combining <b>the</b> patented <b>microprocessors</b> and other apparently conventional devices, such as PCs.) In so ruling, the Court reversed {{the judgment of the}} Federal Circuit holding that the licenses were effective under the Mallinckrodt doctrine.|$|R
50|$|The COMX-35 was a home {{computer}} {{that was one}} of the very few systems to use <b>the</b> RCA 1802 <b>microprocessor,</b> <b>the</b> same <b>microprocessor</b> that is also used in some space probes.|$|R
25|$|The main {{contribution}} of Alpha to <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> industry, {{and the main}} reason for its performance, was not so much the architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated design and layout tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design {{in order to deal with}} the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> design community.|$|E

These ASICs contain an average of 80,000 gates each. The IP21 supports <b>the</b> R8000 <b>microprocessor</b> and can be configured {{with one or two}} such <b>microprocessors.</b> <b>The</b> IP25 supported R10000 microprocessors.|$|R
25|$|Current {{interest}} in low power energy harvesting is for independent sensor networks. In these applications an energy harvesting scheme puts power stored into a capacitor then boosted/regulated {{to a second}} storage capacitor or battery for the use in <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor.</b> The power is usually used in a sensor application and the data stored or is transmitted possibly through a wireless method.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>microprocessor</b> is a {{computer}} chip that processes instructions and communicates with outside devices, controlling most of the operations of {{a computer}} through the central processing unit on a single integrated circuit. The first commercially available microprocessor was a silicon-based chip, the Intel 4004, co-invented in 1971 by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor for a calculator company named Busicom, and produced by Intel.|$|E

25|$|Intel {{had created}} the first microprocessor, its 4-bit 4004, in 1971. By 1975, AMD entered <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080, and the Am2900 {{bit-slice}} microprocessor family. When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, granting AMD a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of this research, which began on 24 August 1998, {{involved}} a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, which was used to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity.

25|$|Digital {{protective}} relays {{were in their}} infancy during the late 1960s. An experimental digital protection system was tested in the lab and {{in the field in}} the early 1970s. Unlike the relays mentioned above, digital {{protective relays}} have two main parts: hardware and software. The world's first commercially available digital protective relay was introduced to the power industry in 1984. In spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them.|$|E
25|$|Very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) is {{the process}} of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. <b>The</b> <b>microprocessor</b> is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.|$|E
25|$|AMD had a {{large and}} {{successful}} flash memory business, even during the dotcom bust. In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion, {{a joint venture with}} Fujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993. AMD divested itself of Spansion in December 2005, in order to focus on <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.|$|E
5000|$|The Signetics 2650 was an 8-bit {{microprocessor}} {{introduced in}} mid-1975. According to Adam Osborne's book An Introduction to Microprocessors Vol 2: Some Real Products, it was [...] "the most minicomputer-like" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>microprocessors</b> available at <b>the</b> time.|$|R

50|$|Although it {{was based}} on the 21064A, the 21066A did not have the 16 KB {{instruction}} and data caches. A feature specific to the 21066A was power management - <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor's</b> internal clock frequency could be adjusted by software.|$|R
25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E
25|$|In the Master Agreement, LGE {{required}} Intel to {{give its}} customers {{notice that the}} patent license does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would {{have no effect on}} the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel’s customers to combine <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court’s opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like <b>the</b> <b>microprocessor</b> {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E
