500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} {{with respect to the}} impact of the rising share of wind power and other renewables such as solar on retail electricity prices in South Australia. A 2012 report by The Energy Users Association of Australia claimed that retail electricity prices in South Australia were then the third highest in the developed world behind Germany and Denmark, with prices likely to rise to become the most expensive in the near future. The then South Australian Opposition Leader, Isobel Redmond, linked the state's high retail prices for electricity to the Government's policy of promoting development of renewable energy, noting that Germany and Denmark had followed similar policies. On the other hand, it has been noted that the impact of wind power on the merit order effect, where relatively low cost wind power is purchased by retailers before higher cost sources of power, has been credited for a decline in the wholesale electricity price in South Australia. Data compiled by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows South Australian wholesale electricity prices are the third highest out of Australia's five mainland states, with the 2013 South Australian Electricity Report noting that increases in prices were [...] "largely driven by <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>network</b> price increases".|$|E

Under this plan Hydro-Québec would pay the $4.8 billion debt of NB Power and provide rate savings valued at $5.6 billion by freezing New Brunswick residential electricity rates {{for five years and}} matching industrial rates to Quebec for five years, while rising both at the rate of inflation thereafter. The plan met with some support and some opposition in New Brunswick with opinion polls showing the Liberals losing support because of the proposed agreement, [...] Graham hoped to finalize the deal before March 31, 2010, when a 3% rate increase was scheduled. [...] The opposition Conservatives were very critical of the proposal, though some accused them of hypocrisy for having tried to sell major NB Power assets when they were in power.|$|E
