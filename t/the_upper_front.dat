25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{consisted of}} a rectangular cuboid cross-braced central frame, onto which the main monoplane wing, the motor, the forward and rear booms and the ‘undercarriage’ (consisting of one wheel {{at each of the}} lower corners) were mounted. Between <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> and rear posts of the frame were fitted two streamlined fuel tanks (clearly visible in the image above), one on each side of and above the pilot’s seat, with a combined capacity of six gallons (22.7 L.).|$|E
25|$|The describers {{established}} six distinguishing traits. At {{their very}} midline, the praemaxillae {{meet in a}} small sharp point, set within a larger notch in the snout tip as a whole. The front lower side edge of the praemaxilla protrudes to below. At least seventeen cervical vertebrae are present. The neural spines of the middle cervical vertebrae have a notch at their lower front edge with immediately above it a process directed to the front. The vertebrae of the middle neck, rear neck and front back possess neural spines that have a transversely expanded upper end. On the neck two rows of triangular bony plates are present that have a lightly convex outer side and a notch at <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> edge creating a hook.|$|E

500|$|Characteristic {{features}} of the tyrannosauroid pelvis include a [...] notch at <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> end of the ilium, a sharply defined vertical ridge on the outside surface of the ilium, extending upwards from the acetabulum (hip socket), and a huge [...] "boot" [...] {{on the end of}} the pubis, more than half as long as the shaft of the pubis itself. These features are found in all known tyrannosauroids, including basal members Guanlong and Dilong. The pubis is not known in Aviatyrannis or Stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in the ilium. The hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids, like most theropods, had four toes, although the first toe (the hallux) did not contact the ground. Tyrannosauroid hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods, and show proportions characteristic of fast-running animals, including elongated tibiae and metatarsals. These proportions persist even in the largest adult Tyrannosaurus, despite its probable inability to run. The third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at the top between the second and fourth, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus. The arctometatarsus was also present in Appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in Eotyrannus or Dryptosaurus. This structure was shared by derived ornithomimids, troodontids and caenagnathids, but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong, indicating convergent evolution.|$|E

[...] For example, if the measurement {{from the edge}} of the lower front teeth to the edge of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth is 40 millimeters and the overbite is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were several}} limited {{editions of the}} BCNR33 {{produced}} by NISMO - Nissan's Motorsport division. The first, the LM version, was released in May 1996 to celebrate Nissan's participation in the 24-hours of Le Mans. The only body colour available for the R33 LM was Champion Blue. The car had a front splitter lip to direct air to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> aperture, and a carbon fibre rear wing with Gurney flap. There were carbon fibre inserts on the rear wing fins with a GT-R badge on the inserts. The [...] "GT-R Skyline" [...] logo under the checkered flag {{was placed on the}} C-pillars.|$|E
2500|$|The armor of the PT-76 {{consists}} of homogeneous, cold-rolled, welded steel. Its turret has 20mm at 35° at the front, 16mm at 35° at the sides, 11mm at 33° {{at the rear}} and 8mm at 0° {{on top of the}} turret. The hull is made up of: 10mm at 80° at <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front,</b> 13mm at 80° at the lower front, 14mm at 0° at the sides, 7mm at 0° in the rear and 5mm at 0° underneath. This gives it protection against 7.62mm small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments. It does not protect it against 12.7mm or [...]50-caliber heavy machine gun fire or larger shell fragments.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial splint is the {{nociceptive}} trigeminal inhibition tension {{suppression system}} (NTI-TSS) dental guard. This splint snaps onto <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth only. It is theorized to prevent tissue damages primarily {{by reducing the}} bite force from attempts to close the jaw normally into a forward twisting of the lower front teeth. The intent is for the brain to interpret the nerve sensations as undesirable, automatically and subconsciously reducing clenching force. However, there may be potential for the NTI-TSS device {{to act as a}} Dahl appliance, holding the posterior teeth out of occlusion and leading to their over-eruption, deranging the occlusion (i.e. [...] it may cause the teeth to move position). Hence, ongoing follow-ups are recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Formula One, he sported a black helmet with a white {{diagonal}} line crossing from each side until the angles of the visor and a thicker red diagonal line beneath the white line and a red number 9 {{in a corner of}} the white line (to allude to his car number), a white circle in the top with black edged designs (similar to horns) on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front.</b> The design on the top became black and in the back of the helmet there was the inscription [...] "Iceman" [...] written in red letters. From the Australian Grand Prix, there were more details added on top of the helmet. For the Monaco Grand Prix, he wore a replica of the 1976 James Hunt helmet.

2500|$|There are 15 consonants in the Kinaray-a language. They are Bb, Kk, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ll, Mm, Nn, NG ng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Ww, and Yy. They are {{pronounced}} {{the same way}} as in English but a little bit lighter than their English equivalents. An exception is the letter [...] "r" [...] which is prevalent in Kinaray-a. It is sounded by flicking the tip of the tongue against the back of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth and rolled a bit. Likewise the letters g, w, and y are also pronounced a bit harder as a terminal letter of a word with a grave accent mark. Except for [...] foreign loan words, the consonants c, f, j, q, x, and z don’t appear in Kinaray-a words. If foreign words are without Kinaray-a equivalent, they are either written as is, or written as pronounced using the Kinaray-a alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|Adult sand tigers {{range from}} [...] to [...] {{in length and}} [...] to [...] in weight. The head is pointy, as opposed to round, while the snout is {{flattened}} with a conical shape. Its body is stout and bulky and its mouth extends beyond the eyes. The eyes of the sand tiger shark are small, lacking eyelids. A sand tiger usually swims with its mouth open displaying three rows of protruding, smooth-edged, sharp-pointed teeth. The males have grey claspers with white tips located {{on the underside of}} their body. The caudal fin is elongated with a long upper lobe (i.e. strongly heterocercal). They have two large, broad-based grey dorsal fins set back beyond the pectoral fins. The sand tiger shark has a grey-brown back and pale underside. Adults tend to have reddish-brown spots scattered, mostly on the hind part of the body. In August 2007, an albino specimen was photographed off South West Rocks, Australia. The teeth of these sharks have no transverse serrations (as have many other sharks) but they have a large, smooth main cusp with a tiny cusplet {{on each side of the}} main cusp. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>front</b> teeth are separated from the teeth on the side of the mouth by small intermediate teeth.|$|E
