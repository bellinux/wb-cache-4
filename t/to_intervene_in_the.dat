5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August, {{the central}} {{government}} decided not <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suspension of Nagpal, as she did not appeal or challenge the suspension order given by the Uttar Pradesh government. Since Nagpal's suspension on 27 July, the Centre had issued three reminders to the UP government, seeking a detailed report. On 4 August, the UP government had sent a report on Nagpal's suspension to the DoPT and had served a chargesheet to Nagpal, which deemed her actions as unwarranted and in violation of rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fall of the}} Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial regalia to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and he could only appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} EU as a {{provider}} of security outside the EU. As an example, we chose to analyse, why the EU decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central African Republic. Our analysis is grounded in a securitization framework and therefore focusses on how <b>the</b> conflict <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central African Republic has been constructed as a problem within an EU context. To operationalise the analysis we utilised Kingdon’s “Three Stream Model”, which provided a more comprehensive understanding of why the EU decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central African Republic. Our main findings were: 1) several securitizing actors managed to move <b>the</b> conflict <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CAR from being a condition to being a problem with speech acts constructing the conflict as a security problem {{within the context of}} the EU. 2) The institutional framework of the CSDP and the CFSP created a platform where <b>the</b> decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central African Republic was technically feasible. 3) <b>The</b> positive attitudes <b>in</b> civil society regarding military interventions with reference to humanitarian concerns established a context where the EU’s decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily was made possible. Consequently, the three streams formed a policy window where the adoption of <b>the</b> decision <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> militarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central African Republic was made possible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end...|$|R

5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{name of the}} United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.|$|E

5|$|In January 1322, two Dalmatian towns, Šibenik and Trogir, {{rebelled against}} Mladen II Šubić, {{who was a}} son of Charles's {{one-time}} leading partisan, Paul Šubić. The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict between his subjects. Many Croatian lords (including his own brother, Paul II Šubić) also turned against Mladen, and their coalition defeated him at Klis. In September, Charles marched to Croatia where all the Croatian lords who were opposed to Mladen Šubić yielded to him in Knin. Mladen Šubić also visited Charles, but the king had the powerful lord imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without {{insisting on the}} Schomburgk line {{as a basis for}} negotiation. Negotiations between the United States and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report of the Boundary Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E

On January 18, the UK's House of Commons debated whether to ban Trump from the country; however, while some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House condemned Trump's remarks and described them as [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "offensive", most were opposed <b>to</b> <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electoral process of another country, and a vote was not taken.|$|R

5|$|In a naval review off Yokosuka on 10 November 1913, {{she served}} as the {{flagship}} for the Taishō Emperor. Katori occupied the German colony of Saipan, shortly {{after the start of}} World War I, on 14 October 1914. Afterward the ship began a refit in 1914 that lasted until late 1916 and was assigned to the 2nd Battleship Squadron upon its completion. During this refit, two 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns were replaced two of the low-angle 12-pounders. She became the flagship of the 5th Battleship Squadron in 1917–18 and served as the flagship for the Japanese commander-in-chief at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in late 1918 as Japan decided <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|Stephen had <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{north of}} England {{immediately}} after his coronation. David I of Scotland invaded the {{north on the}} news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to Cumberland, and David also claiming Northumbria {{by virtue of his}} marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl Waltheof. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham. An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David's son Prince Henry's possessions in England, including the Earldom of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|The US government's {{response}} to this announcement was the adoption of containment, the goal of which was {{to stop the spread}} of Communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. Even though the insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence.|$|E
5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} term, Ross was forced <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared {{there would be}} armed battles between the white {{supremacist}} Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, {{who had been killed}} in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.|$|E

New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M.

She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off {{the east coast of}} Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon Bonaparte's {{victories}} in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure {{victory for the}} French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still {{at war with the}} French Republic. The French Directory investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the French Navy to challenge the Royal Navy at sea. Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term, and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796. This allowed Bonaparte to propose an invasion of Egypt as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent Irish uprising <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island's south were {{exploited}} by the Dutch {{to increase their}} control.
