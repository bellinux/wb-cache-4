5|$|It was, at first, {{merely a}} folly. It {{was used as}} a summer-house, and seven {{counties}} could be seen, as now, {{from the top of the}} flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> the Duke.|$|E

60|$|Certainly, {{all must}} admit, that if {{for any one}} this problem of the {{possible}} reconcilement of this world with our own souls possessed a peculiar and potential interest, that one was Pierre Glendinning at the period we now write of. For in obedience to <b>the</b> loftiest <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> his soul, he had done certain vital acts, which had already lost him his worldly felicity, and which he felt must in the end indirectly work him some still additional and not-to-be-thought-of woe.|$|R

5|$|A 1996 E. Coli {{outbreak}} {{at one of}} Burger King's largest beef providers, Hudson Foods, gave Tyson Foods one of {{its largest}} business coups.

Once it had secured a contract with Burger King, Hudson opened a beef processing plant in Nebraska. When the plant was identified as the source of an E.

5|$|After {{a fire at}} Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} a move to the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in September 1928.

5|$|After a naval career lasting {{more than}} forty years, in 1912 he was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his background as a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> King George V, in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Erected at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} {{in the development of}} astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922.

The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E

The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> mayor Richard J. Daley. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007.

5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of}} a slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E

40|$|We studied <b>the</b> <b>beh</b> avior <b>of</b> {{different}} pH {{values of}} Rhodamine B solution impregnated into pores of mesoporous silica, through structural characterization techniques, such as {{scanning electron microscopy}} and porosity measurements, and spectroscopic characterization techniques, such as infrared and luminescence spectroscopy; in order to applications in luminescence. Because, Rhodamine B is an interesting xanthene dye whose optical properties depend of many factors, dye concentration and pH values. MSU- 4 type mesoporous silica has been synthesized with Tween 60 surfactant as directing-structure agent and tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OEt) 4, TEOS) as silica source. The mesoporous structures doped with dyes are promissory materials for several applications, for example, optical sensors and biomarkers. <br /...|$|R
