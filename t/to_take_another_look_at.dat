500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this situation".|$|E
500|$|Allusions to the {{painting}} were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of {{the painting}} were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model {{as part of his}} Follies. In this successful version of September Morn, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the [...] "September Morning Glories", was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter– featuring a fifty-strong chorus line– was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing [...] "little or no clothing" [...] passed himself off as [...] "September Morn" [...] at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references {{to the painting}} continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he [...] "might keep turning the light on <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it".|$|E

500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said they wanted me to come back <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E
500|$|Hewett {{began the}} 1893 season in good form, {{reaching}} his half-century {{in each of}} his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton {{for the first time since}} 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that [...] "the decision not to play was premature." [...] At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that [...] "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." [...] David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's [...] "mind wasn't on the game." [...] No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that [...] "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." [...] Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.|$|E

From 1960 on, I attempted to express this relationship between man and nature in my works.

The extract and one of its major compounds were able to act as pro-differentiating and protecting agents towards skin cells by stimulating the expressions of markers taking part in the structure of epidermis and dermis. Also, the extract showed beneficial effects on the global morphology of the skin. Thus, Lythrum salicaria L. constitutes a new natural source for the development of active ingredients for the dermo-cosmetic field...|$|R
