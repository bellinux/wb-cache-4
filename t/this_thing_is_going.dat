6000|$|... "To be {{sure they}} will--especially after all we did for them on the Lakes," [...] put in Sam. [...] "But let me tell you, I am curious to know how <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen. Gee, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be {{the biggest}} ever. I gotta new idea. It just came to me. Your saying that put it into my head. Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to cable over to Betty to come right along here, and I'm going to have her marry this prince guy. Yes, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|Many of {{the senior}} clerks had {{occasion}} {{to pass through the}} waiting-room. Two {{of the senior}} clerks held views about the weather which they appeared wishful to express at length.

6000|$|... 'They will bid high,' replied Tadpole. 'Nothing {{could be}} more unfortunate than <b>this</b> death. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on so well and so quietly! The Wesleyans almost with us!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] replied Nasmyth, whose tense face did not relax. [...] "That is, it would, {{if we had}} run {{the water}} out of the valley; but, as it happens, we haven't cut down very much of the fall yet, and <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to make the men we have against us keener than ever. They're {{probably}} plotting how to strike us now. Get those letters open." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{a foolish}} {{community}} that can house whole classes, useful and helpful, honest and loyal classes, in such squalidly unsuitable dwellings. It {{is by no}} means the social economy it seems, to use up old women, savings and inexperience in order to meet the landlord's demands. But any one who doubts <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on right up to to-day need only spend an afternoon in hunting for lodgings in any of the regions of London I have named.|$|E
60|$|Now it {{occurred}} to Rachel that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> further than it should. To be set up {{as a kind of}} guardian spirit to the Zulus had seemed a very good joke, and naturally appealed to the love of power which is common to women. But when it involved, at any rate in the eyes of that people, dominion over her own parents, the joke was, she felt, becoming serious. So she determined suddenly to bring it to an end.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} further discomforted him. It {{was growing}} upon him that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> the success he had anticipated. It {{would be necessary}} to proceed warily.|$|R

60|$|But <b>this</b> summer <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{a little}} {{different}} at Broadstone, for Mrs. Easterfield had arranged for some house parties.

6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about the lawgivers," [...] said Clayton, [...] "but I have {{to say a word}} or two about the law. Do you think <b>this</b> kind of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to remain?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Linguist Patricia Cukor-Avila jokingly {{states that}} [...] "eventually {{all the people}} who hate <b>this</b> kind of <b>thing</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> dead, and the ones who use it <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> in control." ...|$|R

You see, Mr Clennam, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on for a long time, and I find no improvement in it. Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about it as yourself, is an immense relief to me. Quite a boon. Quite a blessing, I am sure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't feel so shabby if we {{had seen}} them. But to hang round here in this plebeian abeyance, and then to be {{defeated}} and defrauded at last! I wonder how long <b>this</b> sort of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on?" ...|$|R
50|$|Commenting to a {{newspaper}} in September 2015 he recalled, To me {{it was the most}} exciting thing on the horizon, a totally new experience. I remember watching the ground crew very carefully before take-off, wondering if they thought they were waving goodbye to me forever or whether they thought <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to return. The noise it made was absolutely thunderous and it was like being in charge of a runaway train; everything changed so rapidly and I really had to have my wits about me. Brown flight tested all three of the German jet designs to see front-line action in the war: the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Arado Ar 234, each type powered by Junkers Jumo 004 engines, and the BMW 003-powered Heinkel He 162 turbojet combat aircraft. He would later fly the He-162 at the Farnborough Air Show, and described it as having the best controls of any aircraft he had ever flown but as being difficult to handle. One of his colleagues at Farnborough died trying the aircraft type in an evaluation.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've {{made up my}} {{mind that}} <b>this</b> sort of <b>thing's</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on long enough," [...] the officer said, shaking the boy from Saranac, as he led him toward the {{approaching}} policeman.

5000|$|... "You {{have got}} to think how to apply {{elements}} of design to these cheaply sold books; to put the touch of art on <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> produced at a level price, which allows for no handwork, the decoration to be cut with a die, the books to go out by the thousand and to be sold at a low price[...] [...] What I feel is that under these conditions, the more necessary it is to design covers well because they are really like aesthetic tracts. They go everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From time to {{time she}} wrote to me. I learned that you still refused to see your son, and I gathered, though she did not say much of <b>this,</b> that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> badly with them. At last, she wrote {{that her husband was}} ill--very ill, she feared. He had, in vain, tried to get employment. I don't think he was {{naturally}} strong, and the anxiety had broken him down. Then I went up to London at once, and found them, in a little room, without the necessaries of life. I brought them down home, and nursed him for three months, till he died.|$|R
50|$|Todd Brown, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, {{claims to have}} been, drawn in by the simple but {{compelling}} {{story of a young}} family haunted and possessed, with, a pretty compelling blend of pulp with legitimate tension, which looks to ride that same split in influences, of technical proficiency and just plain pulp that has long been the mark of Turkish genre films, though the technical end looks stronger than most, with, truly moody and unsettling imagery. If the film comes close to living up to the trailer <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> EASILY <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> the best Turkish genre picture of the past five to ten years, he concludes.|$|R
5000|$|Walter Hill {{admitted}} {{there were}} [...] "some difficult moments" [...] {{arising out of}} changing the story from a film to a mini series.I think the arguments came about because nobody {{wanted to make it}} something other than what it was. We all understood that if <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> any good, you needed to stick with what had made it good up to that point and try to develop that further rather than to introduce some entirely new format and style. But {{at the same time you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have to change it because if you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to go from the 125 page script to the 160 pages or whatever I certainly felt that a few more narrative events might not be a bad idea. I thought we had plenty of sitting around the fire and talking things over. Duvall requested that they restore some of the previous focus: [...] "And I said, 'You'd better get it back to the way it was,' and they began to rewrite and we rewrote. We had to because it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> off in the wrong direction," [...] said Duvall, explaining that the altered script had a new and, to him, unwarranted emphasis on [...] "gunfights" [...] and other [...] "very obvious, melodramatic" [...] plot devices. [...] "We had to get back to the way Alan Geoffrion wrote it. So when we got it back, I went to work Monday morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, I {{was awake}} {{last night when}} she got home," [...] went on Lane, seriously. [...] "It was one o'clock. She came in a car. I heard girls tittering. And some boy {{came up on the}} porch with Lorna and kissed her. Well, that might not mean much--but {{something}} about their talk, the way it was done--makes me pretty sick. Did you know <b>this</b> sort of <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016, Devoleena accused actress Utkarsha Naik, {{who played}} the role of Pramila in the same show of {{kidnapping}} her dog &#39;Jugnu&#39; from the sets. She could not find her pet anywhere and for that reason she filed a complaint against her to PETA. She said, [...] &#8220;Yes, I am filing a complaint against Utkarsha, I think she is the one who is behind missing of Jugnu. Utkarsha was the one who took Jugnu in her car.

"I don't suppose," [...] Lutchester continued, as they strolled {{across the}} lawn, [...] "that {{you have very}} much {{influence}} with your uncle, or that he would listen very much to anything {{that you have to}} say, but if he is really in earnest about <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to play a terribly dangerous game. As <b>things</b> <b>are</b> at present, he has a very pleasant and responsible position as the supporter and friend of very able men.

We made a deal from the very beginning — everybody sort of shook hands with the understanding that there <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> no boundaries on <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make an open and honest film and that we weren't going to leave the good stuff on the cutting room floor."

40|$|Romania has {{not passed}} through a crisis as the {{existing}} one in the last 10 years. Despite the unfavorable conditions of economy, Romania, however, has sufficient advantages in comparison with other states which have been more seriously affected by the global crisis. Therefore, one of the economists’ greatest fears is that, because of decreased liquidities {{and the lack of}} confidence in Romania, the holding banks form Europe may let their branches in our country with less money than it should. BNR says that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> to happen. Romanian bankers sustain the same fact, and they say that credit lines, and that means the money put at the disposal of Romania’s banks by the European groups they are belonging to, will be at least at the same level as last year.

5000|$|Coming {{into the}} match after their {{previous}} week loss at the Supercopa de España, Valencia captain David Albelda admitted {{the team was}} [...] "not at 100 per cent" [...] and was still [...] "hurt by the defeat", but this setback should help them [...] "go into the match fully concentrated and go all out to win".On the other hand, Porto were coming from another Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira victory. The team's midfielder and captain Costinha assured that Valencia would be [...] "an even tougher match" [...] as it is [...] "a very experienced team with good players". Remembering the Super Cup defeat against Milan in the previous year, Costinha showed no doubts: [...] "... <b>this</b> time <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> different.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} both Richardson's and Fielding's {{concepts of}} virtue which are revealed in their novel, Pamela and Joseph Andrews. Both Richardson and Fielding are moralist. They talk about virtue in their novels, but Fielding perceives Richardson's concept of virtue in Pamela {{is not the}} rigth one. Then he writes Joseph An-drews to attack all that seems unrealistic and false in Pamela and he tries to present the right concept of vir-tue. Based on <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>this</b> thesis <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to discuss the kind of concept Fielding has about virtue which makes him perceives Richardson's concept in Pamela is wrong and the way Fielding uses to show his disagreement towards Pamela. Since he considers Pamela is a hypocrite who pretends to be virtuous, Fielding uses many ways to uncover Pamela's hypocrisy. Finally, this thesis <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to discuss Fielding's failure in his attack towards Pamela. Fielding who at first disapproves with Richardson's concept in Pamela, {{as a matter of}} fact, does not present a different concept of virtue from Richardson's. The real concept of virtue he is suggested in Joseph Andrews is similar to that in Pamela. Actually, Joseph and Pamela as the main characters in the novels, are not different in virtue. They have the same good moral, manners, and personalities. Thus, Richardson's concept of virtue is Fielding's concept too...|$|R
