5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E

25|$|Although Linus Pauling {{is known}} for highly respectable {{research}} in chemistry and biochemistry, he is also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Pauling wrote multiple books endorsing vitamin C megadosing. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. Researchers Vitetta, Sali, Paspaliaris, and Reavley (2002) completed a double blind randomized control study with 400 healthy participants. Throughout the 18 month experiment, there were 189 reported cases of head colds. Researchers found that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> between the medication groups, and taking 1,000mg of vitamin C at {{the first signs of}} a head cold did not help (Vitetta et al., 2002). There are also some minor yet unwanted ailments associated with vitamin C megadosing. These ailments were first noted in 1981 by Dr. Fong, who said that large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and urethritis for limited amounts of time (Fong, 1981).|$|E
500|$|Gurnida et al. (2012) {{assessed}} the cognitive effects of formula supplemented with a ganglioside-enriched, MFGM-derived complex milk lipid in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, healthy infants (2–8 weeks of age) were fed until 6 months of age, either control infant formula (n=30), or a supplemented infant formula (n=29) with added complex milk lipids to increase ganglioside concentration to approximately 11-12 μg/mL {{to be within}} the human milk range. [...] A breastfed reference group (n=32) was also included. Results showed that serum ganglioside levels in the supplemented group were significantly higher compared to the control group at 6 months, but did not significantly differ from levels in the breastfed group. The cognitive outcomes measured using the Griffiths Mental Development Scale showed that the supplemented group had significantly increased scores for Hand and Eye Coordination, Performance, and Total Score (General Quotient) at 6 months compared to the control group, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in cognitive performance compared to the breastfed reference group.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{pregnancy}} on prospective memory {{is still under}} current study. Rendell et al.

Pregnant women [...] {{are more likely to}} remember to perform an intention after the cue has already passed. Further, women tested a few months after giving birth were found to forget intentions entirely. Both these findings may be related to stress encountered during pregnancy or child rearing and lack of sleep.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} that genetic influences have on personality characteristics can change across a five-year period. Age differences create more variables even within a family, {{so the best}} comparisons are found using twins. Twins typically share a family environment called a shared environment because they may share other aspects like teachers, school, and friends. A non-shared environment means completely different environment for both subjects. [...] "Biologically related children who are separated after birth and raised in different families live in non-shared environments." [...] Identical twins separated at birth and raised in different families constitute the best cases for heredity and personality because similarities between the two are due only to genetic influences. Vulnerability {{was a factor in}} this study that was taken into consideration regarding the issue of genetic influences on vulnerability. The study concluded that the monozygotic co-twins would be more similar than dizygotic co-twins in change over time. The data concluded that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> for either variances between the monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins.|$|E
