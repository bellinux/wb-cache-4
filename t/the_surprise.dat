5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Surprise</b> of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. <b>The</b> <b>Surprise</b> of Meaux marked {{a turning point}} in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E

5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

However, to <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> of Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men were {{standing in front of}} the city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper re-examines the {{well-established}} {{distinction between}} expression and description of emotion as regards <b>surprise.</b> First, <b>the</b> authors show that <b>the</b> expression of <b>surprise</b> {{does not involve}} <b>the</b> use of <b>surprise</b> lexemes, but rather mirative utterances and specific syntactic constructions (while <b>the</b> description of <b>surprise</b> involves <b>surprise</b> lexemes). Second, <b>the</b> investigation of the corpus data indicates that surprise lexemes – namely <b>the</b> noun <b>surprise</b> and <b>the</b> adjective <b>surprised</b> – differ from other emotion lexemes in {{that they do not}} systematically refer to the emotional state of an experiencer. <b>The</b> noun <b>surprise</b> can have such a state reading but can also evaluate a source seen as a salient unexpected referent. As for <b>the</b> adjective <b>surprised,</b> it may serve various argumentative strategies. These uses reflect the epistemic rather than emotional nature of surprise, which sets it apart from other emotions...|$|R

The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
