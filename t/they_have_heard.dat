5|$|The Sacristan re-enters with choristers, {{celebrating the}} news that Napoleon has {{apparently}} been defeated at Marengo. The celebrations cease abruptly with the entry of Scarpia, his henchman Spoletta and several police agents. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that Angelotti has sought refuge in the church. Scarpia orders a search, and the empty food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms {{are found in the}} chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape.|$|E
5|$|Yusef is wrongly {{accused of}} {{having an affair with}} Zainab, due to his {{sister-in-law}} overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair and everyone struggles {{to come to terms with}} what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard.</b> Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits.|$|E

Bodie becomes {{increasingly}} agitated about the unjustifiable nature of the killing of his friend. Officer Jimmy McNulty recognizes Bodie when he vandalizes a patrol car as he is being arrested by other officers.|$|E
5000|$|Participants {{were asked}} if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> about the debate; 56% responded that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> [...] "not too much" [...] or [...] "not at all". 78% said the debate was either [...] "not too" [...] or [...] "not at all" [...] important.|$|R

25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.|$|E
25|$|Many farmers {{around the}} world are unaware of fair trade {{practices}} that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee {{is one of the most}} highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day. When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Marine Lieutenant Cable {{arrives on}} the island from Guadalcanal, having been sent {{to take part in}} a {{dangerous}} spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan. [...] Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit [...] "Bali Ha'i", mysteriously telling him that it is his special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go. [...] Cable meets with his commanding officers, Captain George Brackett and Commander William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live {{on the island}} where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.|$|E
500|$|The {{spirits of}} slaves are also said to haunt {{a portion of}} Independence Avenue SW, the site {{of two of the}} city's largest and most notorious slave markets. The Yellow House or Williams Slave Pen (at about 800 Independence Avenue SW, now the site of the {{headquarters}} of the Federal Aviation Administration) was the most notorious slave pen in the capital: A modest, well-maintained, two-story yellow house concealed a very large basement in which slaves were chained to walls in windowless rooms, while a [...] yard surrounded by a [...] high brick wall provided space for the training and selling of slaves. Another large slave market, the Robey Slave Pen, was just a block away at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW. On dark nights, witnesses say <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the clinking of chains and screams on Independence Avenue where these slave pens used to operate.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} mostly {{consists of}} reading {{and listening to the}} conversations provided. Every now and then, a [...] "Please Select Your Destiny" [...] event will occur, giving the player multiple choices on how to respond. The choices selected determine who will be Rin's destined love; depending on which route the player takes, there will be between 8 and 12 multiple-choice questions. At a certain point in the visual novel, a translucent image of the destined character appears when the day changes indicating who Rin has fallen in love with after which the multiple-choice events become almost nonexistent. Near the end of the game, two sex scenes will occur. After some more conversation the visual novel ends. After the visual novel has been completed at least once, players can view CG (computer graphics) artwork they have observed, skip to scenes or endings for characters they have viewed, and listen to music <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Recently in {{the great}} Sung dynasty of China {{there are many who}} call {{themselves}} [...] "Zen masters". They do not know the length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, {{it would not have been}} transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.|$|E
2500|$|Those who {{approached}} from a consumer-rights standpoint {{were not as}} solicitous. Texas arbitration expert Alan Scott Rau called Scalia's phrasing [...] "sloppy and unguarded", noting it failed to recognize that some challenges to a contract that the law reserves for courts, such as capacity and forgery, necessarily include the arbitration clause. Stephen Ware of Kansas calls on Congress to repeal the separability doctrine and require that courts be permitted to compel arbitration only after <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> and rejected any challenges to {{the validity of the}} contract itself: [...] "The separability doctrine separates arbitration law from an important part of contract law — the defenses to enforcement — and thus fails to provide the right to litigate with the protection of those defenses." ...|$|E

2500|$|The concert {{begins with}} Harrison {{taking to the}} stage alone and {{addressing}} the audience, his comment [...] "We've got a good show lined up – well, I hope so anyway..." [...] alluding to {{the speed with which}} the event was organised. He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Bob Katz {{announced}} on his website that [...] "The last {{battle of the}} loudness war has been won", claiming that Apple's mandatory use of Sound Check for iTunes Radio meant that [...] "The way to turn the loudness race around right now, is for every producer and mastering engineer to ask their clients if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> iTunes Radio. When they respond in the affirmative, the engineer/producer tells them they need {{to turn down the}} level of their song(s) to the standard level or iTunes Radio will do it for them. He or she should also explain that overcompressed material sounds [...] "wimpy" [...] and [...] "small" [...] in comparison to more open material on iTunes Radio." [...] He believes this will eventually result in producers and engineers making more dynamic masters to take account of this factor. His point of view has been widely reported and discussed.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{isolated}} island, Mary lives {{with a man}} who is known to the other islanders as a holy man. This man works at his scriptures desperate for a vision to enable him to complete them. Two men arrive on the island as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that the Queen of Heaven lives there. Sent by the islanders to the croft where Mary and the man live, they are told no such person lives on the island and they should stop their search for false gods. The two men leave. Soon after, another boat arrives on the island with Jesus in the company of Simon and Andrew. Jesus takes Mary away with him, walking on water to reach the boat. John remains on the island and is reinspired to complete his work..."It was the Lord's Day, and at once he knew that this was to be the great day of his life!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Hume leaves {{open the}} {{possibility}} for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history: He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so {{for the benefit of}} their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in [...] "ignorant and barbarous nations" [...] and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.|$|E

5000|$|Gropen et al."s 1989 studies {{investigated}} {{these two}} hypotheses. According to these theorists, a strict [...] "conservatism hypothesis" [...] is false.

However, the theorists proposed that a weaker version of the conservatism hypothesis is true, because children used verbs {{more often than not}} in the alternation <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> them used in.
