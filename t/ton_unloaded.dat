50|$|It weighs 45 <b>tons</b> <b>unloaded,</b> {{light enough}} {{that it can be}} hoisted onto a cargo ship, while still able to carry up to 20 tons of cargo. The ship is 88.6 ft in length, with a width of 40 ft and a height of 18.5 ft, yet has a draft of only 2.5 ft.|$|R
50|$|The ground {{breaking}} {{ceremony for}} the second container terminal was held on 6 October 2012. The terminal opened in April 2015. The port <b>unloaded</b> 19.36 million <b>tons</b> in 2008, recording a 15.72% growth over the 16.73 million <b>tons</b> of <b>unloaded</b> tonnage the previous year. In 2008, Dammam handled 1.2-1.3 million TEUs or about 25% of all goods entering and exiting Saudi Arabia.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{production}} and characterization of liquid scintillators {{for the detection of}} electron antineutrinos by the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. One hundred eighty-five tons of gadolinium-loaded (0. 1 % by mass) liquid scintillator (Gd-LS) and two hundred <b>tons</b> of <b>unloaded</b> liquid scintillator (LS) were successfully produced from a linear-alkylbenzene (LAB) solvent in six months. The scintillator properties, the production and purification systems, and the quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures are described. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures.

50|$|Capt. Lester B. Lampman assumed command on 8 August 1966. In October, Rankin {{was called}} on to render relief to the {{disaster}} area of Cayes-Jacmel, Haiti, after Hurricane Inez caused massive damage to the island. The men of Rankin <b>unloaded</b> <b>tons</b> of food, medical supplies, and building supplies to help the stricken people. After her regular overhaul period in 1967, Rankin returned to operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean with Amphibious Squadron Ten.|$|R
50|$|Portable pretzel rides for carnivals weighed about 9 <b>tons.</b> They were <b>unloaded</b> from huge moving {{vans and}} set up. For the first 3 decades, Pretzel rides were single story. In the late 1950s, they started making double decker (2 story) rides. The ride carts were hoisted to the 2nd story by a lift chain. Leon Cassidy {{was not in}} favor of the double decker. The Mad Giant was 17 tons, 40'x 8' on trailer, and 70'x30' when opened up. It took about 5 hours to set it up. Pretzel also made {{spinning}} rides, including a famous one for Coney Island.|$|R
50|$|When he {{took the}} job as manager of the National Horse Show, he had never managed a show. At the old Garden, the show could use the National Armory stables for 500 horses, but after the move to the new Garden in 1968, only 311 stalls were available, some of which could only be used for tack. Each year Craven shoehorned upward of 300 horses into the fifth-floor walk-up {{that served as the}} {{stabling}} area at the Garden, an after-dark maneuver that often took place while a New York Rangers hockey game was being played below. It also meant dozens of temporary stalls in horse vans {{on the streets of the}} garment district and headaches for Craven. It was an annual tradition for newspapers to carry a photo of dump trucks <b>unloading</b> <b>tons</b> of loam and binder's clay onto the concrete floor of the Garden - the same dirt that was rented and returned each November for more than 40 years. Craven also had to streamline the show and cut some traditional classes to enable the show to end by 11 o'clock p.m. to avoid overtime pay to Garden employees.|$|R
5000|$|The {{park was}} built on Taylor Yard, a {{brownfield}} abandoned freight-switching facility used by the Union Pacific and later the Southern Pacific railroads from the 1920s until 1985. Wildlife slowly began re-inhabiting the area and through the 1980s, 1990s, and early-2000s, the abandoned Taylor Yard served as a dirt-track for motorcyclists and off-road enthusiasts and became locally known as [...] "Camelback". In the early-2000s an effort was begun to transform the abandoned wasteland into a recreation area. The property was eventually purchased by the City of Los Angeles and demolition of the abandoned train terminals begin. The rail-lines connecting the Taylor Yard to the Union Pacific Railroad were torn out, the corroding train terminals where trains once loaded and <b>unloaded</b> <b>tons</b> of freight were demolished, and the concrete on the ground was removed by hand. Toxic waste {{left over from the}} work done at the Taylor Yard had to be systematically removed and treated before it would be deemed safe for public use by the city. After months of demolition and work done by conservationist groups, Rio de Los Angeles State Park was opened on April 21, 2007. It is located at 1900 San Fernando Road.|$|R
50|$|In late 1853, George Alonzo Johnson {{with his}} partner Hartshorne and a new partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox, formed George A. Johnson & Company and {{obtained}} the contract from the U. S. Army to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. Johnson and his partners all having learned a lesson from their previous failed attempts ascending the Colorado, and with {{the example of the}} earlier steamboat Uncle Sam, brought the parts of a more powerful side-wheel steamboat, the General Jesup, with them to the mouth of the Colorado from San Francisco. The General Jesup was 104 feet long with a 17-foot beam, 27 feet with its paddle guards, and drew 30 inches of water. There it was reassembled and launched at a landing in the upper tidewater of the river and reached Fort Yuma, January 18, 1854. This new boat with a 50-horsepower steam engine, capable of carrying 50 <b>tons</b> of cargo <b>unloaded</b> in the estuary up river against the strong current of the Colorado River, was very successful making round trips from the estuary to the fort in only four or five days. Costs of transport of goods to the fort were cut from $500 per ton or more to only $75 per ton.|$|R
5000|$|... 29 June 1972 Hanson {{was sent}} to Quảng Trị to support the {{movement}} of 1400 South Vietnamese Marines (VNMC 4th & 1st Battalions) along with USMC 9th MAB (Operation Lam Son 72 I) from Tam My to Quảng Trị to be conducted totally by CH-46s and CH-53s. Hanson arrived at just about midnight. There was an overcast and the moon and stars were not visible. At least 16 other US Navy cruisers, destroyers and destroyer escorts were present. Also present but to the east on the horizon were two LPH's ( [...] & [...] ) and the , ready for a dawn launching of helicopters to the Tam My and Quảng Trị city areas. B-52s were arriving every 20 minutes over a location northwest of Hanson to <b>unload</b> <b>tons</b> of bombs that flashed and thundered throughout the night until the scheduled operation to occur at 08:00 on 29 June. The armada of ships then went to General Quarters (as published in Plan Of the Day) and the two LPH's launched their helicopters that headed inland at a low altitude (about 200 feet). About two hours into the operation, Hanson went to a relaxed General Quarters condition. All the ships were then available for Naval Gun Fire Support roles as the day (29 June) progressed. Hanson remained off Quảng Trị until 3 July. Hanson later steamed to just outside Da Nang harbor and met with a South Vietnamese (ARVN PTF- no709) which tied up alongside for the transfer of beer to the PBR for a July 4 celebration.|$|R
