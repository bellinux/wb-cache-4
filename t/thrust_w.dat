40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} a general class of {{abstract}} aerial robotic systems named Laterally Bounded Force (LBF) vehicles, {{in which most}} of the control authority is expressed along a principal thrust direction, while in the lateral directions a (smaller and possibly null) force may be exploited to achieve full-pose tracking. This class approximates well platforms endowed with non-coplanar/non-collinear rotors that can use the tilted propellers to slightly change the orientation of the total <b>thrust</b> <b>w.</b> r. t. the body frame. For this broad class of systems, we introduce a new geometric control strategy in SE(3) to achieve, whenever made possible by the force constraints, the independent tracking of position-plus-orientation trajectories. The exponential tracking of a feasible full-pose reference trajectory is proven using a Lyapunov technique in SE(3). The method can deal seamlessly with both under- and fully-actuated LBF platforms. The controller guarantees the tracking of at least the positional part in the case that an unfeasible full-pose reference trajectory is provided. The paper provides several experimental tests clearly showing the practicability of the approach and the sharp improvement with respect to state of-the-art approaches...|$|E

The purpose of the vanes is to reduce jet noise radiated towards the community, and the specific appli-cation {{of this study is}} for a supersonic turbofan engines with bypass ratio 2. 7. The cost function used in the optimization includes entropy generation and a penalty for deviating from a target deflection angle. The initial vane airfoil is the NACA 0012. The vane airfoil arising from the optimization produces flat distributions of pressure coefficient over the surface of the vane thus preventing the formation of sonic bubble and strong shocks. For a fixed flow deflection angle, the optimal airfoil is up to 22. 5 % more efficient in terms of specific thrust loss compared to the NACA 0012. Importantly, the optimization leads to a thicker airfoil with 15 % thickness which may be advantageous for structural reasons.

INTRODUCI’ION. Although airplanes are generally designed so that the propeller nsiz lies approximately in the direction of normal steady flight, the condition of yaw is found during such maneuvers as curved flight and in flight at high angle of attack. These maneuvers are usually of short durntion and, while the effect of yaw- from these causes may be, in apeciticoases, of interest, it is possibly of no great consequence. If, however, propellers are to be yawed in the steady-flight condition, the effects of yaw mny be important. Such a condition would arise in the case that a wing engine is placed, for struo-tuml or other reasons, with its axis at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the plane. Air propellers in yaw {{have been the subject of}} both theoretical and experimental invcatigation (references 1 to 6) but further information concerning the quanti-tative effect of 6 malIangles of yam upon thrust, power, cross-wind force, and efficiency seemed desirable and therefore the present study ma undertaken. While the study was made with the propeller axis in the hori-zontal plane and the angle between the propeller axis and the wind direction is thus called an angle of yaw, the results may be applied as well to angles of pitch Bincesuch body interference as was present would have been the s~me in either case.

Displacement on the Paris thrust diminished to the south, and died out in splays where displacement {{was transferred to the}} Willard <b>thrust.</b> <b>West</b> of Woodruff, Utah, splays of the Laketown thrust deformed a complex footwall imbricate of the Willard thrust. To the east, a major northeast-striking Crawford thrust splay exhibits a change in slip vectors from east to southeast. Reorientation of these slip vectors is recorded by an imbricate stack of thrusts in the Willard thrust footwall to the west. The sharp bend in the surface trace of the Crawford normal fault southeast of Randolph, Utah, reflects the separation of the south-southeast-trending surface traces of the Crawford thrust and this northeast-trending splay. Cross sections indicate that the Sheep Creek thrust, a major splay off the basal decollement {{at the base of the}} Crawford thrust sheet, accommodated displacement during the transition from thrusting on the western thrust system (Paris-Woodruff-Willard, and Laketown-Meade-Home Canyon) to the structurally lower eastern thrust system (Crawford, Absaroka, and younger thrusts). The Sheep Creek thrust trends northeast and folded the Laketown thrust in the central Bear River Range. Shortening in the northeast part of the study area was accommodated by the Home Canyon thrust along a detachment in the Jurassic Twin Creek Limestone.

There are two common types of compounding known as wing and <b>thrust</b> compounding. <b>Wing</b> compounding offloads the rotor at high speeds delaying the onset of retreating blade stall, hence increasing the maximum achievable speed, whereas with thrust compounding, axial thrust provides additional propulsive force.

40|$|Abstract: Palaeomagnetic and {{structural}} investigations in the Rif arc of Morocco {{indicate that there}} have been large rotations associated with a pattern of outwardly directed thrusting. Rock magnetic experiments inconjunction with thermal and alternating field demagnetization demonstrate that eight sites in Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones along the Internal/External boundary have a stable remanent magnetization. This is, in most cases, rotated anticlockwise by as much as 100 ° from the expected Mesozoic declination but in the Tetuan area there are large clockwise rotations. Kinematic indicators from fault surfaces indicate the following. (1) In the eastern Rif there has been pre-dominantly south-directed thrusting, partly overprinted by extensional nd sinistral strike-slip faults. (2) At the eastern end of the N 70 °E striking Jebha Fault zone there is a pattern of dominant sinistral NE-trending and subsidiary dextral SE-trending strike-slip faults, overprinted by normal faults while at the western end deformation consists largely of south directed thrusting.

40|$|The Gulf of Cadiz, off SW Iberia and the NW Moroccan margin, {{straddles}} the cryptic plate boundary between Africa and Eurasia, {{a region where}} the orogenic Alpine compressive deformation in the continental collision zone passes laterally to the west to strike-slip deformation. A set of new multibeam bathymetry, multi-channel and single-channel seismic data presented here image the main morphological features of tectonic origin of {{a significant part of}} the Gulf of Cadiz from the continental shelf to the abyssal plain. These morphotectonic features are shown to result from the reactivation of deeply rooted faults that changed their kinematics from the early Mesozoic rifting, through the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene collision, to the Pliocene–Quaternary thrusting and wrenching. The old faults control deep incised, more than 100 km long canyons and valleys. Several effects of neotectonics on deep water seabed are shown. These include: i) the complex morphology caused by wrenching on the 230 km long WNW–ESE faults that produced en echelon folds on the sediments; ii) the formation of up to 5 km wide crescent shaped scours at roughly 4 km water depth by reactivation of thrusts; iii) 10 km long creep folds on the continental slope; and iv) the formation of landslides on active fault escarpments.

40|$|Abstract. – The {{interpretation}} of 2 D seismic surveys from the Senegalo-Mauritanian basement and the reappraisal of rock-samples from oil exploration drillings provide {{new insights into}} the structure of the Appalachian-Mauritanian belts and the overlying Carboniferous and Permian basins. Two different units have been evidenced below the Mesozoic sedi-mentary cover: a lower unit (Unit 1 : basement) and an upper unit (Unit 2 : Late Palaeozoic basins). Unit 1 shows two distinct tectonic areas: the northern area with two different belts evidenced {{on both sides of the}} Senegalese block and the southern area exhibiting various tilted blocks making part of the Palaeozoic (Ordovician to Devonian) Bové basin. In the northern area the Western Thrust Belt is thrust over the Senegalese block while to the east, the so-called Maurita-nian belt is <b>thrusted</b> over the <b>West</b> African craton. In the Mauritanian belt area, the youngest deformed sediments be-longing to the outcropping Bove basin are Famennian in age. The Mauritanian inner belt underwent two tectono-metamorphic events (circa 330 and 270 Ma). Unit 2 which is unconformably capping both the Western Thrust Belt and the southern tilted blocks of the Paleozoic Bové basin (Casamance basin) is locally affected by eastward and westward-verging thrusts. Unit 2 is dated to the Early Permian by palynomorphs, and could have formed between the early (340 - 320 Ma) and late (270 Ma) Variscan tectonic events. The subsurface Late Palaeozoic basins from Senegal and Mauritania are interpreted as intra Variscan belt basins, similar to those suspected by seismic investigations off shore Guinea and Mauritania...|$|R
40|$|The Moroccan Anti-Atlas region, located {{south of}} the South Atlas Fault, has been viewed {{traditionally}} as containing two segments separated by the Anti-Atlas Major Fault. These two segments are said to consist of: (a) 600 – 700 Ma Pan-African segment located in the northeast; and (b) 2 Ga Eburnian segment situated to the southwest. On the basis of observations in the Zenaga and Saghro inliers and of a recent literature review, we suggest that this subdivision is inappropriate in that Eburnian and Pan-African materials occur throughout the Anti-Atlas region: the entire Anti-Atlas is underlain by Eburnian crust, unconformably overlain by a lower Neoproterozoic passive margin; allochthonous Pan-African ocean crustal slices were <b>thrust</b> onto the <b>West</b> African craton (WAC) passive margin sequence 685 Ma ago {{as a result of}} Pan-African accretion tectonics; high-level high-K calc-alkaline and alkaline granitoids locally intruded the Anti-Atlas sequence as a whole {{at the end of the}} Pan-African orogeny at 585 – 560 Ma; the intervening 100 m. y. interval was marked by quiescence. This succession of events can be related to the behaviour of one single rigid cratonic passive margin during an orogeny and correlated to the Pan-African events that occurred to the east in the Tuareg shield and to the north in Avalonian terranes.

Data were collected from 15 seismological broad band stations, deployed above flat subduction section and also above the transitional to normal section of the Nazca plate. Seismic events were located mostly in part of the Southern Precordillera and Cerrilladas Pedemontanas of Mendoza Province. Focal mechanism solutions were obtained, for selected data between 15 kmand 35 kmdepths, from P wave first motion using FOCMEC software. A band trending NW-NNW of normal focal mechanism earthquakes is located just by the <b>thrust</b> front towards <b>West,</b> and covers the Southern tip of the Southern Precordillera and the Western side of the Cerrilladas Pedemontanas, Mendoza Province, Argentina.

The most significant findings in this work are these signals of extensional regimen which appear in a compressional subduction tectonic regimen. Nevertheless the short temporal experiment precludes firm interpretations about this particular phenomenon. Probably it is related to a temporary stress relaxation. The normal earthquakes are likely associated to normal faults, and/or to their subsidiaries, that were inverted by con traction and now re-inverted at least transitorily as normal.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{simulations of}} earthquake ground motions using prescribed ruptures and dynamic failure. Introducing sliding {{degrees of freedom}} led to an innovative technique for numerical modeling of earthquake sources. This technique allows efficient implementation of both prescribed ruptures and dynamic failure on an arbitrarily oriented fault surface. Off the fault surface {{the solution of the}} three-dimensional, dynamic elasticity equation uses well known finite-element techniques. We employ parallel processing to efficiently compute the ground motions in domains containing millions of degrees of freedom. Using prescribed ruptures we study the sensitivity of long-period near-source ground motions to five earthquake source parameters for hypothetical events on a strike-slip fault (M w 7. 0 to 7. 1) and a <b>thrust</b> fault (M <b>w</b> 6. 6 to 7. 0). The directivity of the ruptures creates large displacement and velocity pulses in the ground motions in the forward direction. We found a good match between the severity of the shaking and the shape of the near-source factor from the 1997 Uniform Building Code for strike-slip faults and thrust faults with surface rupture. However, for blind thrust faults the peak displacement and velocities occur up-dip from the region with the peak near-source factor. We assert that a simple modification to the formulation of the near-source factor improves the match between the severity of the ground motion and the shape of the near-source factor. For simulations with dynamic failure on a strike-slip fault or a thrust fault, we examine what constraints must be imposed on the coefficient of friction to produce realistic ruptures under the application of reasonable shear and normal stress distributions with depth. We found that variation of the coefficient of friction with the shear modulus and the depth produces realistic rupture behavior in both homogeneous and layered half-spaces. Furthermore, we observed a dependence of the rupture speed on the direction of propagation and fluctuations in the rupture speed and slip rate as the rupture encountered changes in the stress field. Including such behavior in prescribed ruptures would yield more realistic ground motions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} and kinematic {{development of a}} major syn-metamorphic slide zone, the Central Donegal slide, is described from the Dalradian Succession of Central Donegal, Ireland. The earliest manifestation of this structure is a large scale reversal {{in the direction of}} younging and stratigraphy across the slide plane, a feature that probably developed at the lower greenschist facies of metamorphism. Kinematic indicators associated with this early deformation have been destroyed by later higher metamorphic grade overprinting, but by correlation with other early structures in Donegal, and with reference to sub-basin development in South and Central Donegal it was probably a Grampian <b>thrust</b> with North <b>West</b> directed transport. This tectonic package was then redeformed at lower amphibolite facies by a kilometric scale shear zone associated with slides and large scale sheath folds. Kinematic indicators show that the sheath folds 'intrude' downwards to the south east although originally they are regarded as having faced upwards to the south east. Following this phase of deformation the Dalradian stratigraphy of Central and South Donegal was largely uninverted and probably lay on the upper normal limb (and represents a deeper level) of the upward facing Glenelly Anticline, a major fold to the east in the Sperrin Mountains which is equated with the Tay Nappe. The zone was then reworked during another (mid-amphibolite facies) event during which large scale south facing and verging folds were formed: the Ballybofey Antiformal complex. Earlier formed sheath folds were refolded, slides reactivated and new slides formed. This phase of deformation is associated with major oblique dextral overthrusting, which with increasing metamorphic grade eventually carries the entire Dalradian cover sequence over Moine - like Proterozoic basement 30 km to the south along the Lough Derg slide. This second amphibolite facies metamorphism can be directly associated with the large scale South East directed overthrusting of the entire Dalradian stratigraphy, and related to crustal thickening and loading via the development of a nappe pile towards the south...|$|R
