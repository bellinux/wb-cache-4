2500|$|Recently, breeders {{have begun}} {{importing}} expensive foreign racehorse breeds like Arabians and Thoroughbreds {{with the goal}} of breeding them to native stock to produce faster horses, but these relatively fragile breeds are unable to survive on the steppe like Mongolian horses can; if left unsheltered, such horses inevitably freeze to death or starve. [...] So, breeders have focused on created crossbreeds between foreign horses and native Mongolian stock. [...] <b>The</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to produce a race horse that has one-quarter foreign blood and three-quarters Mongolian blood; this proportion is believed to create a horse hardy enough to survive in Mongolia and combine the Mongolian horse's stamina and endurance with foreign speed to produce a new breed with the best qualities of both.|$|E
2500|$|Mechner, in anticipating {{frustration}} {{for younger}} gamers {{that may have}} not played the original game, removed the one-shot deaths present in the original that would force the player to restart the game.

They play on from where the True Love fell, and then continue as a third character, a Brute, if the player fails again. While the player can complete the game as any of the characters, <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to reunite Mariko with her True Love, giving the approximate forty-minute game high replayability, according to Mechner. The game maintains the immersion as the player transitions between each character.|$|E
