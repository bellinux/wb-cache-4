40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and depreciation allowances. Mintz (1990) discusses <b>the</b> efficacy of <b>tax</b> holidays in <b>the</b> presence of accelerated depreciation allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the}} assumption that if the assets are long-lived, and <b>the</b> income <b>tax</b> system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> holiday <b>period.</b> If on the other hand the depreciation allowance is deferred till <b>the</b> end of <b>tax</b> holiday <b>period,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> code are such that the firms in <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer accelerated depreciation allowance but can claim normal depreciation allowance only after <b>the</b> expiry of <b>tax</b> holidays <b>period.</b> Whereas <b>the</b> firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal depreciation allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the depreciation allowance. ...|$|R

A significant positive linear association was observed between income level and outpatient visit rates among all age groups of both sexes; however, a significantly higher rate and longer period of hospitalization, and longer outpatient care, were observed among certain lower income subgroups. To control for decreased income due to hospitalization, subjects hospitalized during the previous year were excluded, and the data was then reanalyzed. Significant inverse associations remained in the hospitalization rate among 40 - 59 -year-old men and 60 - 69 -year-old women, and in duration of hospitalization among 40 - 59 and 60 - 69 -year-olds of both sexes and 70 - 74 -year-old women.

Does the tie-breaker rule in Article 4 (1) of the OECD Model determine how a dual-resident taxpayer is to be treated under domestic law or does it merely serve to allocate the role of residence country and source country, respectively? The court answered this question in the negative, holding that the taxpayer was a resident of Germany under the tax treaty tie-breaker rule, but that the tax treaty did not prevent Luxembourg from treating him (a non-resident {{under the terms of the}} tax treaty) as a resident to the extent that doing so did not violate Germany’s primary taxing right, which resulted in (progressive) joint taxation with his spouse in Luxembourg.
