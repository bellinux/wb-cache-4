5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to hunt the deer. The King, while trying to hunt the deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} assume, as mentioned, {{that the}} story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom - The concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary - but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king {{to break through the}} legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: Bathsheba, the woman of Tekoa, and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry. Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman. He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.|$|E

25|$|Ben-Hur is {{the romantic}} {{story of a}} fictional nobleman named Judah Ben-Hur, who tries to save his family from misfortune and restore honor to the family name, while earning {{the love of a}} modest female Jew named Esther. It is also a tale of vengeance and spiritual {{forgiveness}} that includes themes of Christian redemption and God's benevolence through <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> of strangers. A popular theme with readers during Gilded Age America, when the novel was first published, was the idea of achieving prosperity through piety. In Ben-Hur this is portrayed through Judah's rise from poverty to great wealth, the challenges he faces to his virtuous nature, and the rich rewards he receives, both materially and spiritually, for his efforts.|$|E

25|$|Sometime after Lord Brahma {{commenced}} {{the process}} of creating the universe, he grew weak due to the sheer task before him. He sought the help of Lord Shiva and offered a yajna (fire ritual) to please the supreme divinity. Lord Shiva pleased with his offerings, appeared before him and sacrificed his shakti (energy) to assist Lord Brahma in the task of completing the creation of the universe. Lord Brahma thankful for <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> Lord Shiva bestowed upon him, vowed that one day his shakti would be given back to him. Therefore, Dakshin (son of Brahma) performed several yajnas to obtain Shiva's shakti as his daughter in the form of Dakshayani.

25|$|Thierno Abdourahmane {{has tried}} to broaden the field of action of poets to other topics, for example: the {{material}} progress or the feeling of nature. It is not however clear of conventional trends, the religion and morals. However, he did not disengage of the classic trends, religion and morality themes. Thierno Abdourahmane resolves the lexical aspect {{of the development of}} African languages in the most natural way by adopting the designations with which objects or actions have been brought. This practice is also in Ogirde Malal of Thierno Mamadou Samba Mombeya. After this literary aspect of progress, the poet passes without transition to a different object, the strong condemnation of the abuse of power by the former canton chiefs. This part is a satirical breath, where emerges <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> for the weak people, the anger against the injustice and tyranny.|$|E
25|$|Benny— Benny {{has been}} the most heavily altered from the {{original}} novel. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the novel, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psycho-drama places him in stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of them will be sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating— but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again - then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E

500|$|Jemima is {{the most}} fleshed out of the lower-class women in the novel; through her Wollstonecraft refuses to accept the submissiveness {{traditionally}} associated with femininity and expresses a frustrated anger {{that would have been}} viewed as unseemly in Maria. Jemima's tale also challenges assumptions regarding prostitutes. Wollstonecraft rewrites the traditional narrative of the redeemed prostitute (e.g., Daniel Defoe's Some Considerations on Streetwalkers (1726)). The novel presents prostitutes as [...] "an exploited class", akin to wives who are dependent on men, and demonstrates how they are a product of their environment. By making both Jemima and Maria prostitutes, Wollstonecraft rejects two contemporary stereotypes of the prostitute: the image of the woman who takes pleasure in her actions and is in love with her keeper and the image of the victim desirous of pity. Thus, rather than simply repulsing or eliciting <b>the</b> <b>compassion</b> of the reader, Jemima and Maria presumably forge a stronger, more lasting bond with the female reader who shares their plight.|$|E
