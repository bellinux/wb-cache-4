5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a tag team match between The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager The Baron, and <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> (Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff), who {{were accompanied by}} Slick. Immediately, The Powers of Pain chased <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> from the ring. Slick, however, distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> an advantage. Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1917, while Lenin was in Finland, General Lavr Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, sent {{troops to}} Petrograd in what {{appeared}} to be a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government. Premier Alexander Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet – including its Bolshevik members – for help, allowing the revolutionaries to organise workers as Red Guards to defend the city. The coup petered out before it reached Petrograd, but the events had allowed <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> to return to the open political arena. Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet had been instrumental in pressurising the government to normalise relations with <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> Both the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of their affiliation with the Provisional Government and its unpopular continuation of the war. <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> capitalised on this, and soon the pro-Bolshevik Marxist Trotsky was elected leader of the Petrograd Soviet. In September, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> gained a majority in the workers' sections of both the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Revolution, on December 3-4, 1917 <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{organized}} <b>the</b> Congress of the Latgalian Councils of Vitebsk Governorate. On December 14, 1917 <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> {{government of}} Soviet Russia ruled that Daugavpils, Ludza and Rēzekne counties {{should be separated}} from the Vitebsk Governorate and united with Vidzeme, which by then was under control of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Iskolat.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{all members}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> party were willing {{to go along with}} what {{increasingly}} looked like an upcoming suppression of the Constituent Assembly. In early December, the moderates even had a majority among <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> delegates to <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly, but Lenin prevailed at the [...] meeting of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Central Committee, which ordered Bolshevik delegates to follow Lenin's line.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> {{argument}} against Parliamentary democracy {{as a method}} of achieving Socialism is a powerful one. My answer to it lies rather in pointing out what I believe to be fallacies in <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> method, from which I conclude that no swift method exists of establishing any desirable form of Socialism. But let us first see what <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> argument is.|$|R
5|$|In February 1917, Anastasia and {{her family}} were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution. Nicholas II abdicated on March 2/15, 1917. As <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> approached, Alexander Kerensky of the Provisional Government had them moved to Tobolsk, Siberia. After <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> seized {{majority}} control of Russia, Anastasia {{and her family}} were moved to the Ipatiev House, or House of Special Purpose, at Yekaterinburg.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland {{would be better off}} with <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alexandra and {{her family}} {{remained}} in Tobolsk until after <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Revolution in November 1917. The fall of the Provincial Government and <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik's</b> accession to power greatly worsened their position.|$|R

5000|$|Opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> regime, Skobelev {{moved to}} his home city of Baku in then-independent Azerbaijan ca. 1919 [...] After <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> victory in <b>the</b> Russian Civil War and re-annexation of Azerbaijan in 1920, he fled to Paris. Once <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> {{government}} instituted <b>the</b> NEP policy of partial liberalization, Skobelev became reconciled with the new regime and eventually joined <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> party in 1922 (over Trotsky's objections [...] ). In late 1922, he worked on facilitating trade relations between France and Russia [...] {{and then returned to}} Russia, where he continued working in the Soviet foreign trade system until his arrest and execution in 1938 during the Great Purge.|$|R
5|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many of <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the robbery gained political power in the new Soviet Union. Lenin went on to become its first premier until his death in 1924, followed by Stalin until his death in 1953. Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat, serving as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (1930–1939). Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909, but rejoined <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> after the 1917 Revolution and served as the Soviet trade representative in London and as People's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926.|$|E
5|$|In December 1917 <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|In May, Natalia {{was granted}} a travel permit to join Michael. Accompanied by family friends Prince Putyatin and Margaret Abakanovich, she arrived at Perm before the Orthodox Easter and they spent about a week together. Meanwhile, {{as part of the}} truce between <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and the Central Powers, prisoners-of-war from Austria–Hungary were being shipped out of Russia. Czech troops were strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway on their way to Vladivostok, where they were due to take ship. The Czechs, though, were not going home to fight for the Austrian empire but to fight for a {{separate}} homeland independent of Austria. The Germans demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> disarm the Czechs, who fought back, seized the railway, joined forces with Russians fighting against <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and advanced westwards toward Perm. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in a dangerous situation and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.|$|E
50|$|Siberian {{agriculture}} {{underwent a}} tremendous shift {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Revolution. <b>The</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> coup d'etat began in 1917 when Vladimir Lenin and his followers deposed Alexander Kerensky's Russian Provisional Government and established a Communist regime.|$|R
50|$|After the February Revolution of 1917, Myasnikyan {{became a}} member of the Western Front's {{frontline}} committee and was an editor of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> newspaper Zvezda in Minsk. He was elected as a delegate for the 6th Congress of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party. He became chairman of the Northwestern Regional Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party, and became part of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Western Region. Myasnikyan was elected the commander of the Western Front at the congress of deputies.|$|R

5|$|The robbery made <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{even less}} popular in Georgia and left <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> in Tiflis without {{effective}} leadership. After the death by natural causes {{of his wife}} Ekaterina Svanidze in November 1907, Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis. Other leading Bolsheviks in Georgia, such as Mikhail Tskhakaya and Filipp Makharadze, were largely absent from Georgia after 1907. Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik, Stepan Shahumyan, moved to Baku. The Bolsheviks' popularity in Tiflis continued to fall, and by 1911, there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b>|$|E
5|$|By December {{the ship}} was in Kronstadt, where she came {{under the control of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> and she was hulked there in May 1918. Grazhdanin was {{scrapped}} beginning in 1924, although she was not officially stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E
5|$|During the war, two of Lord Milford Haven's sisters-in-law (Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna) {{were killed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> in Russia. Eventually, in January 1921, after a long and {{convoluted}} journey, the body of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna was interred in Jerusalem {{in the presence of}} Milford Haven and his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Milford Havens {{had to give}} {{up their}} home, Kent House, for {{financial}} reasons. He sold his collection of naval medals. All of his financial investments in Russia were seized by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and his German property became valueless {{with the collapse of the}} mark. He sold Heiligenberg Castle, which he had inherited from his father, in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|The revolt {{escalated}} {{after the}} armored train named [...] "Vardan zoravar" [...] under command of Sargis Musayelyan joined <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> rebels who {{had formed a}} revolutionary committee (Revkom) and proclaimed Armenia a Soviet state in Alexandopol on May 10. <b>The</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> rebels successfully took over Alexandropol, Kars and Sarikamis.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{problematic}} understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> seizure of power in Petrograd during the Russian revolution as either a ‘coup d’état’ from above or a ‘social revolution’ from below. The complexities, possibilities and limitations of both approaches are explored by analyzing the more general course of {{events leading up to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> seizure of power as well as by looking in greater detail to the internal dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> party and its relation to the Petrograd Soviet in general and the ‘Military Revolutionary Committee’ in particular...|$|R
50|$|No {{public record}} was ever {{made of the}} {{internal}} debates of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party around <b>the</b> July Days. There were some within <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party who advocated an intensification of activity on 17 July. Most prominent among those were Nikolai Podvoisky and Vladimir Nevsky, leaders of the BMO, V. Volodarsky, {{a member of the}} Petersburg Committee, and Martin Latis of <b>the</b> Vyborg District <b>Bolshevik</b> Organization, who was highly critical of the Central Committee's decision to hold back the masses. Others in <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party, including Lenin, were split on what to do. On 18 July at two or three o'clock in the morning, after the Provisional Government dispatched a number of loyal troops from the front to the streets of Petrograd and won the support of a number of previously neutral garrisons of troops, <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Central Committee decided to call off the street demonstrations.|$|R
5|$|In {{foreign policy}} Red Finland leaned on Bolshevist Russia. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace {{agreement}} was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in World War I in general, nationalism {{was more important}} for both sides than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an artillery base, Ino, located in the Karelian Isthmus, was transferred to Russia, while Finland received Petsamo in north-eastern Lapland. The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, {{political}} activist, {{and journalist}} {{best known for}} her sympathetic coverage of Russia and <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> during the Russian Revolution. Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as Six Red Months in Russia in 1918. During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a number}} of other Australians were {{subsequently}} involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918–1919, but they also saw little fighting. Malleson's aim was to block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead his soldiers became involved in fighting <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919.|$|E
