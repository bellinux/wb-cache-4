50|$|The Ponce de Leon Hotel was an {{exclusive}} hotel in St. Augustine, Florida, built by millionaire developer and Standard Oil co-founder Henry M. Flagler and completed in 1888. The Hotel Ponce de Leon was {{designed in the}} Spanish Renaissance style by the New York architects John Carrère and Thomas Hastings. These two would gain world renown and would eventually combine their firms into Carrere & Hastings, The hotel {{was the first of}} its kind constructed entirely of poured concretePark Service, using the local coquina stone as aggregrate. The hotel also was wired for electricity at the onset, with the power being supplied by D.C. generators supplied by Flagler's friend, Thomas Edison. When electricity was first put in Henry M. Flagler hired staff to <b>turn</b> <b>power</b> <b>on</b> and off for his residents, because the people staying at the hotel were too afraid to turn the switches on and off. The building and grounds of the hotel are today a part of Flagler College.|$|E

50|$|Many mixer boards have {{a switch}} for <b>turning</b> phantom <b>power</b> <b>on</b> or off; in most {{high-end}} equipment {{this can be}} done individually by channel, or on smaller mixers all mic channels can be either on or off, also {{this can be done}} in groups in most mid-range boards and some smaller ones. If it is desired to disconnect phantom power from one channel only, this can be done by using a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.|$|R
50|$|The memory battery (aka motherboard, CMOS, {{real-time}} clock (RTC), clock battery) is generally a CR2032 lithium coin cell. This cell battery has an estimated life of 3 years when {{power supply unit}} (PSU) is unplugged or when the PSU <b>power</b> switch is <b>turned</b> off. Other common battery cell types can last significantly longer or shorter periods, such as the smaller CR2016 which will generally last about 40% less time than CR2032. Higher temperatures and longer power-off time will shorten battery cell life. When replacing battery cell, the system time and CMOS BIOS settings may revert to default values. Unwanted BIOS reset may be avoided by replacing battery cell with PSU <b>power</b> switch <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> and plugged into electric socket on the wall. On ATX motherboards, <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>power</b> switch <b>on</b> PSU, will supply 5V standby power to the motherboard to keep CMOS memory energized during computer turned off period.|$|R

Hence, the regulated temperature is like a sliding mode of the variable structure system setup by the bang-bang controller.|$|R
40|$|A large {{solenoid coil}} is wired in {{parallel}} with a neon bulb and an incandescent bulb, and a large DC voltage is applied to this circuit, as shown in Figure 1. When the voltage is either switched on or off, a large potential is created across the lights, as indicated by a bright flash of the bulbs. The higher voltage at the start {{is caused by a}} ballast resistor in series with the solenoid, which has a small voltage drop at first. That voltage drop increases as the coil draws more current and the bulbs dim. The effect is greater when the coil has an iron core, as shown in the video. The direction of the EMF, indicated by the neon bulb, is opposite for the cases of <b>turning</b> the <b>power</b> <b>on</b> and off...|$|R
50|$|Charles confronts several {{super-powered}} beings {{over the}} course of his adventures. While in New York he is saved from attacking malcontents by 'Michael', a being who can perceive and remove mystical antagonists from the minds of others. Michael is the star of another Defiant comic series, Dark Dominion. Later, Charles is attacked by a large, muscle bound pink humanoid who delights in influencing others into suicidal depression. Charles saves Michael, whom he now considers a friend, from this entity. It <b>turns</b> his <b>powers</b> <b>on</b> him. Charles is able to resist this by grabbing his brother's dog tags, which he now wears. The plain reminder of better times allows him to mentally resist the monster then defeat it physically. In the next issue, Michael fights with War Dancer, the star of another Defiant series.|$|R
50|$|At the Dancers, Magrat arrives {{to confront}} the Elf Queen {{at the same time}} as the people of Lancre, rallied by Shawn and Nanny. But the Elf Queen quickly subdues Magrat with glamour. The captive Granny mentally combats the Elf Queen and {{releases}} Magrat from the glamour before succumbing to the Elf Queen's attack, her prone body being covered by the bees from her hive, which have swarmed at the Dancers. When the Elf Queen <b>turns</b> her <b>powers</b> <b>on</b> Magrat, attempting to stop her resistance by dismantling her identity, she exposes the unexpectedly valorous core of Magrat's being, (something which Granny had deliberately been stoking, aggravating and provoking all along for just this very outcome). Magrat attacks and subdues the Elf Queen just in time for a projection of the Elf King to arrive and send the Elves back to their world.|$|R
5000|$|A power-on/power-off switch is {{triggered}} if the trolleybus {{is drawing}} considerable {{power from the}} overhead wires, usually by accelerating, {{at the moment the}} poles pass over the contacts. (The contacts are lined up on the wires in this case.) If the trolleybus [...] "coasts" [...] through the switch, the switch will not activate. Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia and Vancouver, have a manual [...] "power-coast" [...] toggle switch that <b>turns</b> the <b>power</b> <b>on</b> or off. This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or accelerating through a switch without activating it. One variation of the toggle switch will simulate accelerating by causing a larger power draw (through a resistance grid), but will not simulate coasting and prevent activation of the switch by cutting the power.|$|R

However, most of the information is blocked and can only be accessed inside of the KIMRA labs. Using a jeep, the duo gain access the labs and enter after crossing through a clean room. After fighting a large gelatinous blob, Eliot accidentally swallows monster vomit and begins to change into a mutant. Dogs assures Eliot he'll take care of him. Meeting a doctor, the two eventually meet Dr. Jacob, the lead scientist on the [...] "Gigadent". Already mutated, Eliot kills Jacob and takes his disk. Realizing that the mutation is from a virus KIMRA discovered on the island, the duo make a vaccine to cure Eliot and escape the labs.|$|R
50|$|President Antanas Smetona {{opposed the}} occupation, and {{fled the country}} in protest. Before his departure, he <b>turned</b> over his <b>powers</b> <b>on</b> an interim basis to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, who stood next {{in the line of}} {{succession}} under the 1938 Constitution. On 16 June, Merkys announced on a national radio broadcast that he had deposed Smetona and was now president in his own right. Lithuania's official position since 1990 has been that Merkys' usurpation of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never resigned. Therefore, Lithuania contends that all subsequent actions leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void.|$|R

A group of Army Corps of Engineers, who experienced the looting of Hurricane Andrew just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane, students returned to Kauaʻi public schools two weeks after the disaster.

Upon returning to the space station, Rhino and Solarr were punished by Egghead, who then sent Cobalt Man to deal with the Defenders and use his nuclear powers so that Egghead can see the Defenders be destroyed. Cobalt Man was freed from the brainwashing by Clea and Red Guardian. Rhino and Solarr were defeated by Doctor Strange (who was possessed by the Star of Capistan and had become the Red Rajah).
