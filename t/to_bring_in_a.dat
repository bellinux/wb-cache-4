5|$|The metal {{pipework}} {{was stolen}} after {{the closure of}} the chapel, and, as part of the restoration project discussed above, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> replacement instrument.

5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E

He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London.

Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero {{was created}} from a {{partnership}} between RedOctane, then their own company that produced specialized video game controllers, and Harmonix, a music video game development company who had previously produced Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution. RedOctane was seeking <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Guitar Freaks-like game, highly popular in Japan at the time, into Western markets, and approached Harmonix about helping them to develop a music game involving a guitar controller. Both companies agreed to it, {{and went on to}} produce Guitar Hero in 2005. The title was highly successful, leading to the development of its successful sequel Guitar Hero II in 2006. While the original controllers for the first Guitar Hero game were designed by Ryan Lesser, Rob Kay, Greg LoPiccolo and Alex Rigopulous of Harmonix and built by the Honeybee Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at RedOctane, with development led primarily by Jack McCauley.|$|E

A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him {{a few days later}} for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him.

Votes made via {{landline}} telephones or from the Red Button service cost 35 pence each, with calls made from mobile telephones expected to be more expensive. The votes brought in revenue of more than £5.4million, though it was expected to be a lot higher because of the unknown cost of mobile phone votes. Proceeds were split between production company Syco, co-producer FremantleMedia, broadcaster ITV and phone vote operator Harvest Media. Advertising slots during the final were sold for up to £250,000, which expected <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> further £25million in advertising revenues, with the number of commercial breaks increased from five to six.|$|E
5|$|The season {{came down}} to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself more apt than his peers <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox {{the rest of the}} way as the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.|$|E

Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irvings’ demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights {{that have been in}} decline across North America.|$|E
