50|$|This {{method has}} been shown to {{generate}} chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and <b>taq</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.|$|R

40|$|The PCR is an {{extremely}} powerful method for detecting microorganisms.

It is widely accepted that purification of target DNA before PCR is necessary for successful amplification. In an attempt to overcome PCR inhibition, enhance PCR amplification, and simplify the PCR protocol, we demonstrate improved PCR-enhancing cocktails containing nonionic detergent, l-carnitine, d-(+) -trehalose, and heparin. These cocktails, in combination with two inhibitor-resistant Taq mutants, OmniTaq and Omni Klentaq, enabled efficient amplification of exogenous, endogenous, and high-GC content DNA targets directly from crude samples containing human plasma, serum, and whole blood without DNA purification. In {{the presence of these}} enhancer cocktails, the mutant enzymes were able to tolerate at least 25 % plasma, serum, or whole blood and as high as 80 % GC content templates in PCR reactions. These enhancer cocktails also improved the performance of the novel Taq mutants in real-time PCR amplification using crude samples, both in SYBR Green fluorescence detection and TaqMan assays.

Of these, seven markers were cloned and then five which showed a positive specific hybridization signal were sequenced. For these five markers, 30 sequence-specific primers ranging from 14 to 29 bases were designed to amplify genomic DNA from 64 grapevine cultivars under more-stringent PCR conditions. Only, two primer pairs, OpA 111175 p 17 R/p 17 F and OpD 10800 p 14 R/p 14 F, still produced a specific SCAR marker, the 'Folle blanche' ScA 111175 and the 'Malvasía Sitges' ScD 10800 respectively. Moreover, the ScA 111175 marker was amplified only in 'Folle blanche' among the 64 cultivars tested with a large annealing temperature range using either two different <b>Taq</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> or two separate thermocyclers.

50|$|<b>Taq</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase’s</b> 5’-nuclease {{activity}} {{is used in}} the TaqMan assay for SNP genotyping. The TaqMan assay is performed concurrently with a PCR reaction and the results can be read in real-time as the PCR reaction proceeds (McGuigan & Ralston 2002). The assay requires forward and reverse PCR primers that will amplify a region that includes the SNP polymorphic site. Allele discrimination is achieved using FRET combined with one or two allele-specific probes that hybridize to the SNP polymorphic site. The probes will have a fluorophore linked to their 5’ end and a quencher molecule linked to their 3’ end. While the probe is intact, the quencher will remain in close proximity to the fluorophore, eliminating the fluorophore’s signal. During the PCR amplification step, if the allele-specific probe is perfectly complementary to the SNP allele, it will bind to the target DNA strand and then get degraded by 5’-nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase as it extends the DNA from the PCR primers. The degradation of the probe results in the separation of the fluorophore from the quencher molecule, generating a detectable signal. If the allele-specific probe is not perfectly complementary, it will have lower melting temperature and not bind as efficiently. This prevents the nuclease from acting on the probe (McGuigan & Ralston 2002).|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} PCR-generated artifacts (i. e., chimeras, mutations, and heteroduplexes) {{with the}} 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) -based cloning approach, a model community of four species was constructed from alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions {{of the division}} Proteobacteria as well as gram-positive bacterium, all {{of which could be}} distinguished by HhaI restriction digestion patterns. The overall PCR artifacts were significantly different among the three <b>Taq</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> examined: 20 % for Z-Taq, with the highest processitivity; 15 % for LA-Taq, with the highest fidelity and intermediate processitivity; and 7 % for the conventionally used <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> AmpliTaq. In contrast to the theoretical prediction, the frequency of chimeras for both Z-Taq (8. 7 %) and LA-Taq (6. 2 %) was higher than that for AmpliTaq (2. 5 %). The frequencies of chimeras and of heteroduplexes for Z-Taq were almost three times higher than those of AmpliTaq. The total PCR artifacts increased as PCR cycles and template concentrations increased and decreased as elongation time increased. Generally the frequency of chimeras was lower than that of mutations but higher than that of heteroduplexes. The total PCR artifacts as well as the frequency of heteroduplexes increased as the species diversity increased. PCR artifacts were significantly reduced by using AmpliTaq and fewer PCR cycles (fewer than 20 cycles), and the heteroduplexes could be effectively removed from PCR products prior to cloning by polyacrylamide gel purification or T 7 endonuclease I digestion. Based upon these results, an optimal approach is proposed to minimize PCR artifacts in 16 S rDNA-based microbial community studies...|$|R

Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3´ to 5´ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3´ adenine-overhangs.The target vector is linearized and cut with a blunt-end restriction enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase. It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue.

50|$|A {{complication}} at {{that point}} was that the DNA polymerase used was destroyed by the high heat used {{at the start of}} each replication cycle and had to be replaced.

Key features of the extraction and purification were cold lysozyme- and SDS-assisted lysis with either freezing-thawing or bead beating, cold phenol extraction of the resulting soil suspension, CsCl and KAc precipitation and, finally, spermine-HCl or glass milk purification of DNA. Crude DNA preparations contained 4 - 20 mug DNA per g of soil extracted, and at least 50 % of this was recovered in the final purified DNA preparations. The resulting DNA was pure enough to be restricted by various enzymes, and was amplifiable at concentrations of up to 20 ng of soil-derived DNA per 50 mul reaction mix.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{evaluation of}} the value and potential of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis {{for the study of}} microbial community structure has been undertaken. The reproducibility and robustness of the method has been assessed using environmental DNA samples isolated directly from PCB-polluted or pristine soil, and subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of total community 16 S rDNA. An initial investigation to assess the variability both within and between different polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) runs showed that almost identical community profiles were consistently produced from the same sample. Similarly, very little variability was observed as a result of variation between replicate restriction digestions, PCR amplifications or between replicate DNA isolations. Decreasing concentrations of template DNA produced a decline in both the complexity and the intensity of fragments present in the community profile, with no additional fragments detected in the higher dilutions that were not already present when more original template DNA was used. Reducing the number of cycles of PCR produced similar results. The greatest variation between profiles generated from the same DNA sample was produced using different <b>Taq</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> while lower levels of variability were found between PCR products that had been produced using different annealing temperatures. Incomplete digestion by the restriction enzyme may, {{as a result of the}} generation of partially digested fragments, lead to an overestimation of the overall diversity within a community. The results obtained indicate that, once standardized, T-RFLP analysis is a highly reproducible and robust technique that yields high-quality fingerprints consisting of fragments of precise sizes, which, in principle, could be phylogenetically assigned, once an appropriate database is constructed...|$|R
