5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though this}} is a field with many uncertainties, it is {{expected}} <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 50 years climate changes will {{have an effect on}} the diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases, creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations. To inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of forest reproductive material, may be needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, aged only 27, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of Engineering at University College, London, a post he would hold for the next 15 years (succeeded by Thomas Hudson Beare). He set about a series of changes that were to reform the way engineering was taught worldwide. He insisted that all of his students received not only lectures in engineering principles but also a firm grounding in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology and the other sciences upon which engineering is based. He also asked that an engineering laboratory be built so that the students could have first hand experience of the applications of their theoretical studies. This proposal met widespread support from the engineering profession and the presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers were among the leading figures who supported it. In 1878 the laboratory was built and put to use, {{it was the first of}} its kind in the world and proved so useful <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> nine years ten other educational institutions followed Professor Kennedy's example and built their own. Whilst working at the UCL he translated Franz Reuleaux's Kinematics of Machinery into English for the first time in 1876. In 1886, he published Mechanics of Machinery, the first time that a book based on Reuleaux's kinematic analysis had been published in English. He also used the laboratory to carry out experiments to determine the strength and elasticity of various materials and was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society for this work in 1887. There followed a series of other experiments in which he investigated the strength of rivetted joints and the possibility of developing new electric turbines.|$|E

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the two men [...] "expressed regret for what had occurred, and pleaded guilty" [...] and [...] "the Bench fined them 40 shillings, and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of the court".Despite initial cynicism from journalists, the NSWCA announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches, and it was reported <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 10 years, gambling at cricket matches in Sydney mainly died out.|$|E
500|$|As to the {{latitude}} claimed, {{the reason for}} doubting its accuracy was that after 3 January all [...] positions [...] had been computed by dead reckoning: on direction, speed and elapsed time.

Shackleton's table of distances show <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three days they covered just over , to reach an estimated 88°7' on 6 January.

This distance {{in a single day}} far exceeded those for any other stage of the journey. Shackleton explained that this was a dash, [...] "half running, half walking", unencumbered by the sledge or other equipment. Each of the four men independently confirmed his belief in the latitude achieved, and none gave any subsequent cause for his word to be doubted.|$|E

[...] Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to Katherine Howard, but was rebuked. [...] His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to [...] "three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument" [...] for help. [...] The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom on the condition <b>that</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to [...] "save his lyef attainder in bloode." [...] He was released on 21June. [...] The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by Thomas Wintour, Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of Christopher Wright) and Guy Fawkes, later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason. [...] However, upon James's accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle), that he would [...] "stand wholly for the King", and [...] "to have no speech with him of Spain." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says <b>that,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to local}} oral {{tradition}}, in the 11th century {{the island of}} Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the [...] "King" [...] of Shiraz, in Persia.

Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade. Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate.

British attacks have been criticised as amateurish, poorly co-ordinated, in insufficient strength and with inadequate artillery support but most German counter-attacks were also poorly organised and defeated in detail. After the first few days, battalions had been withdrawn from German divisions {{to the south and}} sent to the Somme and on the south bank the XVII Corps (...) had battalions from eleven divisions under command.
