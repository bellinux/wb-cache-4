40|$|The complex {{nature of}} seabed {{interaction}} with Steel Catenary Risers (SCR) in Touch Down Zone (TDZ) and its vital impact on fatigue performance of SCRs makes serious difficulties against proposing simplified and robust solutions for engineering design industry where the fatigue in {{touch down zone}} is still considered as one the most challenging issues in riser design. In this study, authors have tried to explore in deep the mechanism of fatigue generation in <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> with sophisticated numerical simulations capturing the stress variation along the riser under complex load conditions in non-linear hysteretic seabed.

40|$|Surfaces of airport {{pavements}} {{are subject}} to contamination {{that can be very}} dangerous for the movement of aircraft particularly on the runway. A recurrent problem is represented by the deposits of vulcanized rubber of aircraft tires in the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> during landings and lesser during take-offs. This causes a loss of grip that compromises the safety of aircraft movements in take-off and landing operations. This study deals with the surface characteristics decay phenomenon related to contamination from rubber deposits. The experiment was conducted by correlating the pavement surface characteristics, as detected by Grip Tester, to air traffic before and after de-rubberizing operation and two models were constructed for the assessment of functional capacity of the runway before and after the operations de-rubberizing...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{approaches}} using airline-rated Boeing 737 pilots in an FAA qualified simulator has been conducted. The test matrices include both manual and coupled approaches for VFR, Category I and Category II conditions. A nonintrusive oculometer system {{was used to}} track the pilot's eye-point-of-regard throughout the approach. The results indicate that, in general, the pilots use a different scan technique for the manual and coupled (auto-pilot with manual throttle) conditions. For the manual approach 73 {{percent of the time}} was spent on the Flight Director and 13 percent on airspeed as opposed to 50 percent on Flight Director and 23 percent on airspeed for the coupled approaches. For the visual portion of approach from less than 100 m (300 ft) to touchdown or when the touchdown point came into view, the pilots tend to fixate on their aim or <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> until the flare initiation, at which time they let their eye-point-of-regard move up the runway to use the centerline lights for rollout guidance...|$|E
40|$|A {{deterioration}} model of friction {{was set up}} by analyzing the lateral variability of a runway in a regional airport. Airfield runways must provide adequate skid resistance to give the rotation to the wheels, and to ensure the directional control and the safe braking of aircraft operating on the surface. The degree of skid resistance provided by a pavement is expressed in terms of the surface "Coefficient of Friction" (COF) which is simply defined as the ratio of the measured horizontal force (braking) to the vertical one (loading) acting on a test wheel, braked to give a predefined percentage of slip, as the wheel passes over the surface. Runway friction testing is usually performed by making four test runs {{along the length of the}} runway (two on each side of centreline every 3 metres). Through this procedure, areas of low friction could not be identified and the required maintenance actions not programmed. As a matter of fact, runway friction deteriorates with the coverages, which represent the number of times when a particular point on the pavement is expected to be stressed as a result of aircraft operations. Coverages are function of aircraft type (configuration of the landing gear: wheelbase of main gear, number and spacing of wheels), the width of tire-contact area, and the lateral distribution of the aircraft wheel-path relative to the guideline marking (pavement centreline). In this study an experimental analysis was carried out on the regional airport of Rome Ciampino, in order to evaluate the longitudinal and crosswise variability of friction on the runway. The friction tests were made by equipment Adhéra of LPC on about 40 traces (or profiles) every 20 m (i. e. about 3400 friction tests) and a friction map of the runway was developed. The analysis showed a significant lateral, as well as longitudinal, variability of friction, and it suggested that a subdivision of the runway in homogeneous areas should be made (e. g. central <b>touchdown</b> <b>area,</b> lateral <b>touchdown</b> <b>area,</b> etc). Moreover, a criteria for developing {{deterioration model}} through short term experimental measurements was illustrated. As a matter of fact, friction mapping was used to develop an empirical friction deterioration model by regression analysis, in which the friction values are function of number of coverages and contact pressure...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the fatigue}} damage of a steel {{catenary}} riser was investigated, {{especially in the}} vicinity of the touchdown point. The steel catenary riser is a promising riser solution due to its simplicity and low cost. This is in particular true if the motions in heave direction are modest. As the offshore industry is moving into deeper waters, riser solutions will need to be designed with high safety, to ensure interests both economically and environmentally. Understanding how the structure reacts to forces from the environment is therefore of great concern. It is experienced that the steel catenary riser will have a noticeable increase in the fatigue damage in the proximity of the touchdown zone. This is the area where the riser has contact with the sea bottom. The sea bottom will impose forces on the riser, and because of the increased curvature of the structure in this area, the stresses will be magnified. This pipe [...] soil interaction seems to be highly non-linear and it is complex to model the riser realistically in this area. When an ocean current passes the riser, it may form vortices that are shed from both sides of the pipe. If these vortices are shed with a frequency near the natural frequency of the riser, the pipe may start to vibrate. This response is called vortex induced vibration, and the phenomenon is important in riser design. Even if the amplitudes are small compared to vessel induced motions, the high number of cycles may give a significant contribution to the total fatigue damage. In this work, the fatigue damage initiated by the vortex induced vibrations has been investigated, and fatigue analyses of a steel catenary riser have been carried out. In order to perform such analysis taking into account vortex induced vibrations, the computer program VIVANA has been used. VIVANA is an empirical computer program based on experiments and computes the vortex induced response in the frequency domain. In the frequency domain, the pipe [...] sea floor interaction is modelled with discrete springs at the nodes where the riser touches the ground. However, these springs are not released if the riser is lifted, something which gives non-realistic stresses in the area. An alternative way of analysing the fatigue damage near the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> has been proposed and performed. The analysis was based on floater motion statistics, and simulations were done changing the floater offset. The final fatigue result was found by summation of individual fatigue results for different coordinates of the floater in the XY-plane. The results indicated that the fatigue damage was evenly distributed in the proximity of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area,</b> and the maximum and overall damage were reduced. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{pipeline}} installation {{process as}} a part of developing oil and gas production fields in ultra deep water is a challenging task as it involves harsh environmental conditions, limited lay vessel capacity and a set of complicated and high standard procedures that must be fulfilled during the installation process. In order to learn about fatigue damage characteristics that occur with a pipeline during the installation process in ultra deep water, a set of analysis including static, dynamic and fatigue analysis is performed using the Orcaflex software version 9. 2 a for a case study located in North Sea area. Static, dynamic and fatigue analysis are performed for three pipeline installation system models with topangles of 4 °, 7. 4 ° and 40 °, respectively. A pipeline installation system model with a top angle of 7. 4 ° is selected as the main model for fatigue analysis since it gives the minimum forces and moments and the top angle variation values in the dynamic analysis are not more than 30 ° (we have also noted the limitation on the tensioner capacity of the vessel). The dynamic analysis is performed for a water depth of 2000 m and significant wave heights of 2, 3 and 4 m with various combinations of wave and current directions. The dynamic analysis results includingvariations of tensile stresses and bending stresses are combined with the JONSWAP wave spectrum forsignificant wave heights of 2, 3 and 4 m and wave periods of 5 - 13 s to calculate the fatigue damage of the pipeline during the installation process. Fatigue analysis is performed based on the S-N curve approachand Miner’s rule. The dynamic analysis results of the case study show that there is a compression force in the pipeline especially at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area.</b> Compression in a pipe can be avoided by increasing the tension through top angle or layback length adjustments or by providing additional tension from the tensioner. The fatigue analysis results show that high fatigue damages that occur on the pipeline members located at the sea surface area are the effects of the lay vessel movements and high fatigue damages that occur onthe pipeline members located at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> are due to a high bending stress variation that depends on the bending radius and the top angle. The conservative fatigue analysis results for the case study, furthermore, indicate that significant waveheights of 3 and 4 m with wave periods of 6 - 13 s give large contributions to the resulting high fatigue damages. Therefore, a significant wave height of 2 m with wave periods of 5 - 13 s will be suitable wave conditions for conducting pipeline installation process at the case study location (North Sea area). </p...|$|E
40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the zone}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, the so- called <b>touchdown</b> <b>area</b> (TDA). This paper describes the key features of a seafloor-riser interaction model based on the previous experimental model tests. The seafloor is represented in terms of non-linear load-deflection (P-y) relationships, which are also able to account for soil stiffness degradation due to vertical cyclic loading. The P-y approach has some limitations, but simulations show good agreement with experimental data. Hence, stiffness degradation and rate effects during penetration and uplift motion (suction force increase) of the riser are well captured through comparison with previous experimental tests carried out at the Centre for Offshore Foundation Systems (COFS) and Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). The analytical framework considers the riser-seafloor interaction problem {{in terms of a}} pipe resting on a bed of springs, and requires the iterative solution of a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. A series of simulations is used to illustrate the capabilities of the model. Due to the non-linear soil springs with stiffness degradation it is possible to simulate the trench formation process and estimate deflections and moments along the riser length. The seabed model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of stiffness, soil strength, amplitude of pipe displacements, and riser tension on pipe deflections and bending stresses. The input parameters include the material properties (usually pipe and soil), model parameters, and loading conditions such as the amplitude of imposed dis- placements, tension, and moment. Primary outputs from this model include the deflected shape of the riser pipe and bending moments along riser length. The code also provides the location of maximum trench depth and the position where the maximum bending moment occurs and any point where user is interested in...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aeromedical {{transport}} provides immediate advanced {{medical treatment}} for certain critically ill and injured patients, bringing about rapid treatment and decreasing {{the time of}} hospitalization. With the great expense of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), research and review of experience is conducted to determine areas in which the enforcement of standards will enable the effective and optimal use of HEMS. Methods: We examined peer-reviewed published articles in French, English and Persian journals and medical texts {{to determine the best}} use of, and standards for, HEMS. Results: We found that HEMS effectively improves health care in three categories of services: the rapid transportation of medical personnel/equipment to an accident and of patients to the hospital (primary response); meeting road ambulances at an intermediate point coming from a hospital or accident to transport patients to a hospital (secondary response); the planned urgent inter-hospital transfers of critically ill patients for specialized care (tertiary response). HEMS standards have been set for: the flight equipment and crew, the types of emergencies to which HEMS should respond, the optimal length of time for each part of the mission (call out time, response time, on-scene time, transport time, and total rescue time) and the affect on patient survival. Some other standards include: algorithms for patient screening, flight heights for different diseases and injuries, rooftop and parking garage helipad at hospital, approach of flight paths and the facility at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>area.</b> HEMS standard medical equipment includes those needed for telemedicine and basic and advanced life support. Standard drugs on board the HEMS vehicle depends on the type of the missions selected for HEMS. The area of medical crew members, as well as their fundamental and the continuing training, also has standards that must be met. The standard scoring system for severity of injury, and finally, the standard method for the annual calculation of the cost and benefit of using HEMS in a specified region have also been considered. Conclusion: As trauma is a common reason for requesting HEMS in Iran, the decrease in Golden Hour response time for trauma patients is a priority. HEMS is expensive and enforcing standards also requires increased effort and expense. Nevertheless, both can reduce the morbidity, mortality and expense for longer hospital stays. Thus, the proper telemedicine and life support equipment and drugs, as well as algorithms for patient screening can improve HEMS efficacy. Furthermore, enforcing proper communication and record keeping regarding trauma severity for HEMS missions allows hospitals to predict the proper immediate treatment for incoming patients and its future need for HEMS services...|$|E
