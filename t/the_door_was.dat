In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations with Britain, along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> open for renewed negotiations with Britain.|$|E

5000|$|Yichud <b>is</b> {{alleviated}} when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This {{principle is}} known as pesach pasuach lireshus harabim (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open to <b>the</b> public domain, there is no concern of yichud." [...] This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> actually open 2. when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed but unlocked 3. then <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, {{but there is a}} reasonable possibility that people may knock on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as {{there is little or no}} chance that people would come in unexpectedly then.|$|R

Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO.

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

It also debuted atop the Billboard Christian Albums chart and at number two on the Billboard Digital Albums chart. It was the band's largest sales week and highest charting album to date, easily beating 2005's Lifesong which debuted at number nine and sold 71,000 copies in its first week. It was also {{the largest number of}} first-week sales achieved by a Christian artist without support from secular media, with roughly 70% of its first-week sales coming from Christian stores. In its second week, The Altar and the Door sold 41,000 copies. It topped the Billboard Christian Albums chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks from 2007–2008. As a result of the album being offered as a discount at Family Christian Stores, The Altar and the Door topped the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2010; it spent a total of five non-consecutive weeks atop that chart. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of more than 1million copies. As of March 2014, the album has sold 1.2 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> must <b>be</b> {{at least}} {{as strong as the}} walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to {{minimize}} the size and expense. To reduce <b>the</b> weight, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame. Very thick wood also serves, and is more resistant to heat because it chars rather than melts. If <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge.

Once <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed, control of these two mechanical type child locks is completely inaccessible to the passenger.
