2500|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{can lead to}} hypertrichosis. [...] One cause involves areas of the skin that are transforming from the small vellus type to the larger <b>terminal</b> <b>type.</b> This change normally occurs during adolescence, when vellus hair follicles in the underarms and groin grow into terminal hair follicles. Hypertrichosis involves this same type of switching, but in areas that do not normally produce terminal hair. The mechanisms for this switch are poorly understood.|$|E

This can be overridden, however, to force tput to look up a different <b>terminal</b> <b>type</b> in the database, with a command-line option to the command.

40|$|Abstract—A converged {{broadcast}} and telecommunication service platform is presented that {{is able to}} create, deliver, and manage interactive, multimedia content and services for consumption on three different <b>terminal</b> <b>types.</b> The motivations of service providers for designing converged interactive multimedia services, which are crafted for their individual requirements, are investigated. The overall design {{of the system is}} presented with particular emphasis placed on the operational features of each of the sub-systems, the flows of media and metadata through the sub-systems and the formats and protocols required for inter-communication between them. The key features of tools required for creating converged interactive multimedia content for a range of different end-user <b>terminal</b> <b>types</b> are examined. Finally possible enhancements to this system are discussed. This study is of particular interest to those organizations currently conducting trials and commercial launches of DVB-H services because it provides them with an insight of the various additional functions required in the service provisioning platforms to provide fully interactive services to a range of different mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>types.</b> Index Terms—Broadcasting, multimedia communication, service platform, terrestrial mobile cellular radio systems.

50|$|Using curses, programmers {{are able}} to write text-based {{applications}} without writing directly for any specific <b>terminal</b> <b>type.</b> The curses library on the executing system sends the correct control characters based on the <b>terminal</b> <b>type.</b> It provides an abstraction {{of one or more}} windows that maps onto the terminal screen. Each window is represented by a character matrix. The programmer sets up each window to look as they want the display to look, and then tells the curses package to update the screen. The library determines a minimal set of changes that are needed to update the display and then executes these using the terminal's specific capabilities and control sequences.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{capacity}} of even large processors of that era every CICS installation was required to assemble the source code {{for all of the}} CICS system modules after completing a process similar to system generation (sysgen), called CICSGEN, to establish values for conditional assembly language statements. This process allowed each customer to exclude support from CICS itself for any feature they did not intend to use, such as device support for <b>terminal</b> <b>types</b> not in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} {{machine-readable}} format was {{to avoid}} the unnecessary overhead, in applications programs using systems such as the termcap library, of repeatedly parsing the database content to read the fields of a record. The use of multiple files was to avoid the similar overhead of parsing the database content to find the database record for the target <b>terminal</b> <b>type.</b> The <b>terminal</b> <b>type</b> name index is, effectively, the Unix/POSIX filesystem's ordinary directory structure. Originally, Unix had severe performance problems with large directories containing lots of files, and thus terminfo uses a two-level structure, dividing up the directory entries by first letter {{into a series of}} subdirectories. More recent filesystem formats used on Unix systems don't suffer as much from such problems (because their on-disc directory structures are no longer simple arrays of entries, but are organized into trees or hash tables) and so the necessity for this design element, that still exists in modern terminfo implementations, has since disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Laminae A and A 1 of {{the lateral}} geniculate nucleus in the cat are {{generally}} considered to be a structurally and functionally matched pair of inputs from two eyes, although there are subtle light microscopic and physiological differences. The present study aims to display ultrastructural differences between these two laminae based on electron microscopic observances on the connectivity patterns of their afferents onto two main cell types: relay cells, and interneurons present in this nucleus. In a design of population measurement from randomized sample areas in laminae A and A 1 from six brains, all synaptic contacts made by three <b>terminal</b> <b>types</b> of the geniculate nucleus were identified, and a number of relative distribution properties were analyzed. When the A-laminae were considered as a homogeneous structure, the distribution of the three <b>terminal</b> <b>types</b> on geniculate cells was similar to previously reported results, confirming the validity of the sampling strategies used; RLP (retinal) terminals provided one-fifth of all synapses, whereas RD (from cortex and brainstem) and F (inhibitory) types constituted one-half and one-third, respectively. The relay cells alone received a similar composition of afferents. However, interneurons alone received approximatel...|$|R
