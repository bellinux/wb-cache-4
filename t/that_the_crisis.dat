40|$|Currency crises are a {{recurring}} phenomenon. To increase {{the understanding of}} their changing nature, this paper analyses the evolution of currency crises and assesses them in the generation framework of theoretical models. The self-organising map (SOM), a neural network-based clustering and visualisation tool, is used for clustering pre-crisis periods for emerging market economies. The clustering results are used for finding differences in crises between decades, whereafter the decade clusters are compared with the theoretical framework. We conclude that for emerging market economies, this paper shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> in <b>the</b> 1970 s and 1980 s are of a different nature and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> in <b>the</b> late 1990 s are, {{in comparison with the}} preceding decades, determined by weaker warning signals.
