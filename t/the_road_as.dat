5|$|In 1924 Derbyshire County Council spent £2,000 {{installing}} underground {{telegraph wire}} cables beneath <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>as</b> the above-ground installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms.

5|$|NY114 was {{assigned}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has remained intact since. The highway {{has had two}} proposed spurs by Suffolk County that were failed to be constructed. NYSDOT has also marked most of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> New York State Bicycle Route114 (NY Bike Route114) with diversions onto local streets in Sag Harbor, and north and west of the northern terminus along NY25 in Greenport.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road,</b> <b>as</b> well as {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. The road carries an annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer as the road is used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of the road is significantly more congested as it carries Pula suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|At school, Cartman begins farting fire, and Kyle unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{convince}} his teacher, Mr. Garrison, to excuse him from class to find his brother. When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>As</b> he gets back up, he is trampled over by a herd of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
50|$|The Minic Motorways system {{allowed the}} {{modeller}} to animate <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> railways in their townscapes. Some modellers used flexible track manufactured by Peco {{to enhance the}} level of realism.|$|R

50|$|To the East, Sasanian {{glass was}} equally recognised. China named <b>the</b> Silk <b>Road</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Horse <b>Road</b> or <b>the</b> Glass <b>Road,</b> <b>as</b> Sasanian glass was ‘highly appreciated’ there (Gyselen 2007, 17). Similarly in Japan, it {{appeared}} in the tombs (Shoshoin, Okinoshima, Kamigamo, etc.) of high-status nobility related to the Emperor (Roger 2005; Whitehouse 2005).|$|R
5|$|Continuing into Manalapan Township, {{the route}} runs through more {{suburban}} areas and passes {{to the east}} of the former Manalapan Mall, which is now a big–box complex. US 9 reaches an interchange with CR 3 before passing a mix of farmland and development as it crosses into Marlboro Township. In Marlboro Township, businesses predominate <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> it reaches an interchange with Union Hill Road. Following this, US 9 continues north and crosses CR 520.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{consensus}} remained that the road was most probably Roman. It was still referenced as an undoubted Roman road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> Roman and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction was still the most probable explanation of the structure.|$|E
5|$|From this point, {{the route}} {{continues}} east through dense woods prior to turning northeast into Liberty Township. The road {{passes through the}} community of Townsbury before crossing into Independence Township. Here, US 46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> it passes through Great Meadows-Vienna. It continues southeast before entering Hackettstown, where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line and Montclair-Boonton Line before coming to an intersection with CR 517. Here, CR 517 forms a concurrency with US 46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of Route 182, CR 517 splits from US 46 by heading south on that route while US 46 continues to the east.|$|E

5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge {{to follow a}} {{slightly}} more westerly alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two streets that ran parallel to the route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> CR17. The ultimately cancelled eastern extension of the Northern State Parkway would have crossed NY111 just south of Village of the Branch at a point north of Mount Pleasant Road. An interchange between the parkway and NY111 was planned at that location.|$|E
5|$|The Infliktour {{supporting}} the debut album began on 30 May 2008, when Cavalera Conspiracy played its first official {{concert at the}} Electric Weekend festival in Madrid, Spain. However, for this live performance and the subsequent European tour, the band had to replace Duplantier, who was unable to join Cavalera Conspiracy on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> he was recording Gojira's fourth studio album, The Way of All Flesh. He was replaced by Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry. Between June and mid-July 2008, the band performed in several festivals, including appearances at the Pinkpop Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Download Festival, Graspop Metal Meeting, Eurockéennes, among others.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the telegraph had resulted in a trail that could be followed for interstate travel, {{but it was a}} haphazard route which only the more adventurous motorists would take. Many travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services; they would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism. In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> important enough for its involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home.

She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the tent with the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{eventually}} built as planned, and opened to traffic in 1999, but the increased costs involved in management and policing of protesters raised {{the profile of}} such campaigns in the United Kingdom, and contributed to several road schemes being cancelled or reviewed {{later on in the}} decade. Those involved in the protest moved on to oppose other schemes in the country, while opinions of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> built have since been mixed. By 2014, the road had become the ninth most congested in the entire country.|$|E

5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>As</b> of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released {{for the future of the}} road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E
5|$|When the First Welland Canal {{was opened}} in 1829, the Niagara Road became a towpath for vessels exiting the Welland River. Oxen {{on the road}} would tow boats against the rapid current of the Niagara River as they exited the canal and {{continued}} south to Lake Erie. In 1833, a large cut was made to connect the canal with Port Colborne, eliminating the use of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> a towpath. It continued {{to be used as}} a public road until the government gave the reserve to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1891.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>as</b> she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
