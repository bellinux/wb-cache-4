25|$|The term {{deforestation}} has {{a meaning}} that covers crossing {{the threshold of}} forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is for the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.|$|E
25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or deletion mutation or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resistance}} of the Khoisan towards the Dutch in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} century is often oversimplified. The notion that the Khoisan people handed over their land to the Dutch is often challenged. The so-called 'Bushman wars' were to a large extent the response of the Khoisan after their dispossession. It is also noted that the Khoisan readily interacted with Bantu and Dutch intruders and this, combined with their loose social organisation and small population, led to a reduction of Khoisan ethnicity. However, the response of resistance was far more complex than that of other colonized people. At the start of the 18th century, the Khoisan in the Western Cape lived in a co-operative state with the Dutch. However, {{by the end of the}} century the majority of the Khoisan operated as 'wage laborers', not that dissimilar to slaves. Geographically, the further away the laborer was from Cape Town, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> became to transport agricultural produce to the markets. The issuing of grazing licenses north of the Berg River in what was [...] then the Tulbagh Basin propelled colonial expansion in the area. This system of land relocation led to the Khoisan losing their land and livestock as well as dramatic change in the social, economic and political development of the Khoisan people. It is important to note that experiences of colonialism and resistance differed between the Khoisan people due to factors such as climate, proximity to markets, land laws and the time in history.|$|E
