The city has become one of the most popular destinations for Western expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>or</b> the Arab world in general. The city's culinary scene has changed from its shawerma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular western restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.|$|E

5|$|Triaenops menamena is {{currently}} {{one of four}} living species in the genus Triaenops; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African T.afer and the Yemeni T.parvus from T.persicus and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus Paratriaenops. An extinct species, Triaenops goodmani, is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate {{the history of the}} Triaenops group. They found that T.menamena (as T.rufus) was closest to mainland African Triaenops (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that T.menamena and the species of Paratriaenops (then still placed in Triaenops) independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by T.menamena was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in Triaenops and included Middle Eastern T.persicus and T.parvus in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within Triaenops, but some evidence suggested that T.menamena is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to T.afer in mainland Africa; therefore, T.menamena may have reached Madagascar from <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>or</b> northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between T.menamena and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|Haplogroup I (M170), {{which is}} now {{relatively}} common and widespread within Europe, may represent a Palaeolithic marker – its age has been estimated at ~ 22,000 BP.

25|$|The {{interest}} in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars, but we find only {{a limited amount of}} socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>or</b> central and northern parts of Africa. Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.|$|E
