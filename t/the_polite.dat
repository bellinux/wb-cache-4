25|$|Civil {{inattention}} {{is defined}} as <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing {{to respond to a}} stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon. It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be so crowded that they 'touch' another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect those around them.|$|E

Anne-Marie and Constantine were married on 18 September 1964 (two weeks after Anne-Marie's 18th birthday) in the Metropolis, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Athens. The bride wore a Jørgen Bender design. Prior to the wedding, Anne-Marie converted from Lutheranism to the Greek Orthodox Church. Also, {{in view of the fact}} that she was marrying a foreign ruler, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her succession rights to the Danish throne for herself and her descendants.|$|E
25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. <b>The</b> <b>polite</b> fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure {{the reality that}} the troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney {{as one of the}} obstacles to ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, {{there is no way of}} knowing whether Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored. Shakespeare's plays seemed to have suffered the severest form of censorship under Tilney.|$|E

25|$|Including songbooks, the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies {{which were}} printed between 1701 and 1800. Due to {{the sheer number}} and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations {{that can be made}} about them. From <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> (Allan Ramsay’s The Tea-Table Miscellany, 1724–27) to the partly obscene (The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany, 1731–33) the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with {{practical}} purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse, 1787), as repositories of useful information (A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose, 1721–30), as elocutionary aids (William Enfield’s The Speaker, 1774-1820), and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, 1702–62).|$|E

But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom.

500|$|The {{division}} between Russian and Western critics remained {{through much of}} the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness. The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, [...] "spoke to the listener’s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality." [...] Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the [...] "violence and 'hysteria' [...] " [...] they detected and felt such emotive displays [...] "attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> engagement of art as an act of amusement." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1966, the Beatles {{had grown}} weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could [...] "send out four waxworks... {{and that would}} satisfy the crowds.

[...] In June that year, two days after {{finishing}} the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: [...] "Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>polite</b> and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.|$|E

500|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} intended for Kakashi to {{debut in the}} second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to {{the other members of}} Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> [...] "de gozaru" [...] in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages of stale compliments and <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them the lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E
500|$|In {{an outpouring}} of mid-century revisionist views, {{scholars}} approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay [...] "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen" [...] that Austen's novels {{did not support the}} status quo but rather subverted it. [...] Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging [...] "her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as [...] "expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order" [...] that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where <b>the</b> <b>polite</b> language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in [...] "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen {{was one of the great}} writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she [...] "combined [...] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both".|$|E
