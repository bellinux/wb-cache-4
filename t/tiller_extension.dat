Two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage {{varieties}} – Hemus and Karnobat, {{with high}} and low Rubisco content in the fully expanded first leaves (Metodiev and Demirevska-Kepova, 1992), were compared in pot vegetation experiments in respect of yield. Changes {{in the content of}} leaf pigments, the levels of total soluble and Rubisco immunoreactive protein were followed during six phenophases: 3 rd leaf, <b>tillering,</b> stem <b>extension,</b> heading, anthesis and milk ripeness. The results show maintenance of high level of photosynthetic components in the phases critical for grain filling regardless of the differences observed in the primary leaves. Thus, the use of Rubisco as an early selection criterion for improved yield is dubious.

This study represents a linear regression model making use of meteorological parameters at critical stages of crop’s life cycle to predict the wheat yield about two months earlier than the harvesting. A statistical based software “Statistical Package for Social Sciences” (SPSS) and MS-excel were employed as working tools. Decadal (ten days) agrometeorological data for Rabi season (for the period 1993 - 2011) being observed at Regional Agromet Centre, Rawalpindi have been utilized. The parameters studied for correlation were mainly rainfall (amount and days), air temperature (minimum, maximum, mean), heat units (on phenological basis), relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration, reference crop evapotran-spiration etc. Finally, minimum temperature, sunshine duration and rainfall amount in January (<b>tillering</b> and stem <b>extension</b> phase) proved to be the reliable predictors for the final yield.

In this study, differences in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) between populations of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) are determined under limited level of nitrogen (N) availability. Each of 93 segregating entries was individually evaluated in a greenhouse in a hydroponics system aiming at 2. 7 - 3. 5 % N in herbage dry matter (DM). The population was examined for root and shoot regrowth, <b>tillering,</b> leaf <b>extension</b> and width in order to screen the genotypes with the most vigorous leaf area regrowth after defoliation. All the entries were also subject to a field study to assess their total N content. Five selections outperformed the corresponding mid-parent values of their source materials by 63 - 124 % in leaf area increase (LAI) and its components: leaf length (8 - 28 %), leaf width (8 - 16 %) and tiller number (16 - 72 %). Tiller number per plant was the most variable (cv = 29. 8 %) component of the LAI index and had a stronger impact (r = 0. 88) upon the DM productivity than did leaf length and width (r = 0. 50 and 0. 48, respectively). Leaf weight ratio of the selections was 3 % lower to 13 % higher than that as a mean of two parents. Harvestable DM yield of the selections was by 70 - 122 % higher relative to the mid-parent value, indicating a selection potential within the heterozygous original material. The selections revealed their superiority in reduced N contents (2. 19 - 2. 27 % in DM) that was reduced by 13 % {{in terms of the}} mid-parent value. Inverse relation (r = - 0. 26) established between the plant N concentration and harvestable DM yield suggests that improvement in nitrogen use efficiency under simulated grazing is mainly the result of better metabolic efficiency arising from more efficient use of proteins for leaf growth.

40|$|The European Nitrates Directive 91 / 6 / 76 /EEC aims {{to ensure}} water quality by {{preventing}} pollution of surface and groundwater induced by nitrates originating from agricultural sources and by promoting agronomical good practices. While {{the implementation of}} this Directive seems effective, it appears however {{that the use of}} nitrogen has still increased by 6 % {{over the last four years}} in 27 European countries. Furthermore, agricultural sources would be still at the origin of 50 % of the total amount of nitrogen discharged into surface waters ([URL] In Wallonia (Belgium), the Nitrates Directive has been transposed under the Sustainable Nitrogen Management in Agriculture Program (PGDA). Launched in 2002, it involves different sets of actions, like rules definitions concerning fertilizers application, specific and appropriate crop management in vulnerable areas, the control of potentially leachable nitrogen (APL) levels in soils, etc. This is the global context in which lies the present thesis. The main aim is to optimise the nitrogen fertiliser practices to ensure that the needs of a winter wheat culture (Triticum aestivum L.) could be met while reducing the environmental pressure. It relies on the use of crop models, which describe the growth and the development of a culture interacting with its environment, namely the soil and the atmosphere. The major difficulty while working with crop models and model-based decision support tools lies in the fact that different sources of uncertainties have an impact on the modelled phenomena. Indeed, crop models are constituted by a consequent number of differential non-linear equations, involving a lot of parameters which need to be determined as accurately as possible in order to match as close as possible observed sequences of measurements. The first source of uncertainty is thus constituted by the parameters definition. Once the model has been correctly and robustly calibrated it can be used to perform predictions. However, in an agronomical context, the time-delay between sowing and harvest is consequent. As the end-season yield is often the expected output, the uncertainty linked to the non-knowledge of the future implies for the modeller to refer to different hypothesis concerning upcoming climatic scenarios. Finally, moving from models to decision systems dealing with N management involves a last source of uncertainty. Indeed the main problem is that the impact of a given practice is delayed in time from its realisation. In addition to the uncertainty linked to climatic projections themselves, it is highly important to consider the interactions between the practices and the climate. Furthermore, in a decision-making process, it could be highly relevant to know the uncertainty's estimation that could be tolerated on the decision [...] Therefore, the present thesis aims to study these different sources of uncertainty in order to design an efficient decision support system. It is divided into five parts. In the first part, a Bayesian sampling algorithm, known as DREAM (DiffeRential Evolution Adaptative Metropolis) will be presented. It was successfully coupled with the STICS soil-crop model used in this study. The a posteriori probability density function of many parameters was sampled in order to improve the simulations of the growth of a winter wheat culture (Triticum aestivum L.). The DREAM algorithm offers different advantages in comparison to usual methods. Among these, it is possible to study i) the most probable a posteriori parameters distributions, ii) the parameters correlations, and iii) the uncertainties impacted on model outputs. Furthermore, a new version of the likelihood function was proposed, making an explicit use of the coefficient of variation. Results showed that it allowed the noise existing on measurements to be considered, but also the heteroscedasticity phenomenon usually encountered in biological growth processes. In parallel, assimilation data is another way to improve models simulations. These techniques allow considering measurements performed in real-time (e. g. remote measures of LAI or soil water content) in order to correct and adjust the possible drift of model simulations. In particular, a recently developed algorithm, known as variational filter, was evaluated. Its superiority, both in term of state variables simulations improvement and parameter resampling, was demonstrated. The third part of the research focuses on the real-time end season yield prediction. It involves building climate matrix ensembles, combining different time ranges of projected mean data and real measured weather originating from the historical records. As the crop growing season progresses, the effects of real monitored data plays a greater role and the prediction reliability increases. Our results demonstrated that a reliable predictive delay of 3 - 4 weeks before harvest could be obtained. Finally, using real-time data acquired with a micrometeorological station enabled to (i) predict, daily, potential yield at the local level, (ii) detect stress occurrence, and (iii) quantify yield losses (or gains). Being based on projected seasonal norms, this methodology is in opposition to another technique that consists to offer a panel of solution for what concerns the future. Such probabilistic technique relies on the use of stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG in this case). However, in the fourth part of this thesis, on the basis of the convergence in law theorem, it was demonstrated that in 90 % of the climatic situations, both approaches were equivalent, exhibiting RRMSE and normalised deviation criteria inferior to 10 %. Furthermore the two approaches offered similar predictive delay-time. The main difference between techniques lies in the finality. The first allows to quickly simulate the remaining yield potential, while the second aims to quantify the uncertainty level associated to the predictions. In the fifth and last part of this thesis, in order to quantify the uncertainty level associated to different modalities of N applications, the STICS model answers were studied under stochastic climatic realisations. It was demonstrated that, if no N was applied, under our temperate climatic conditions, the yield distribution could be considered as normal. However, with increasing N practices, the asymmetry level was found itself increasing. As soon as N was applied, not only were the yields higher, but also was the probability to achieve yields that were at least superior to the mean of the distribution. This undoubtedly reduced the risk for the farmer to achieve low yields levels. To summary all the researches conducted in this thesis, a N strategic decision support system was developed. In a general way, for what concerns the Hesbaye Region, the superiority of three fractions N protocols was demonstrated. In addition, the three rates fertilisation management based on the systematic applications of 60 kgN. ha- 1 at <b>tillering</b> and stem <b>extension</b> stages and offering the possibility to adapt the flag-leaf fraction in real-time appeared as an optimal strategy. Within this tool, the uncertainty associated to climatic variability could be finely characterised, and the risk encountered by the farmer was quantified for different investigated practices. But far more important, it was demonstrated that N management could be optimised in real-time. In a general way, the research should be pursued by studying more fundamentally and systematically a wide range of different agro-environmental situations. In particular, it would be interesting to study of the Genotype × Environment × Cultural practices interactions to ensure food security in a climatic changing world. La directive Européenne 91 / 6 / 76 /EEC vise à protéger la qualité de l’eau en prévenant la pollution des eaux souterraines et superficielles par les nitrates provenant de sources agricoles et en promouvant l’usage de bonnes pratiques. Si la mise en œuvre de cette directive s’avère efficace, il apparaît cependant que l’utilisation d’azote a augmenté de 6 % au cours des quatre dernières années dans les 27 Etats membres et que l’agriculture est toujours à l’origine de plus de 50 % de la quantité totale d’azote déversée dans les eaux superficielles ([URL] En Wallonie, la directive «Nitrates» est transposée sous la forme du Programme de Gestion Durable de l'Azote (PGDA). Entré en vigueur en 2002, celui-ci comporte un ensemble de mesures comme, par exemple, la fixation de règles au niveau de l’épandage des fertilisants, la mise en place de modes de gestion spécifiques des cultures en zones vulnérables, la mesure des teneurs en azote potentiellement lessivable (APL) dans les sols, etc. La thèse de doctorat s'inscrit dans ce contexte général qui vise à optimiser la quantité de fertilisants azotés à apporter à une culture de blé d’hiver (Triticum aestivum L.). Elle s’appuie sur un modèle de culture ou modèle écophysiologique, qui décrit la croissance et le développement d’une culture en interaction avec le sol et l’atmosphère. La difficulté majeure dans l’utilisation d’un tel modèle en tant qu'outil d’aide à la décision est liée aux nombreuses incertitudes qui interviennent à différents niveaux. En effet, les modèles de culture dynamiques sont constitués d’un grand nombre d’équations différentielles non-linéaires, comportant de nombreux paramètres à estimer pour que les sorties se rapprochent le plus possible de séquences observées. Une première source d’incertitude existe donc au niveau des paramètres du modèle. Une fois le modèle robustement calibré, il peut être utilisé à des fins prédictives. Toutefois, dans un contexte agronomique, le délai entre la date de semis et celle de récolte est important. Comme il est souhaitable de prédire le rendement final d’un point de vue quantitatif et qualitatif, différentes hypothèses sur les scénarios climatiques qui interviennent pendant la saison culturale doivent être posées.|$|R
40|$|Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) {{and spring}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{are the most}} widely grown crop species in the {{semi-arid}} to arid areas of the Mediterranean region. However, their average on-farm yields are relatively low, 1. 95 and 2. 60 t ha- 1, respectively (FAO, 2007). Water is generally recognized as the most limiting factor for barley and durum wheat production in the Mediterranean, though it has been found, at least for some regions, that N fertilizer applications have been limiting (Passioura, 2002). Water in the Mediterranean is relatively scarce and predictions for 2025 show that water limitations for agricultural production in that region will intensify (IWMI, 2000). Nitrogen fertilizer represents a significant cost of production for the grower and may also have negative environmental impacts through nitrate leaching, use of fossil fuels for manufacture and application, and N 2 O emissions associated with denitrification. Reducing excessive N fertilizer inputs and increasing water productivity, whilst maintaining acceptable yields, will be aided by increases in uptake efficiency. To {{be in a position}} to manage irrigation and N inputs more effectively, an improved quantitative understanding of relationships between root traits and capture of water and nitrogen is required. The major phase of root growth in wheat and barley is during <b>tillering</b> and stem <b>extension,</b> and total length of the root system increases until about anthesis (Gregory et al., 1978 b; Barraclough & Leigh, 1984). A theoretical model (van Noordwijk, 1983) indicated that the rooting trait best related with water and N capture is the root length density (root length cm/ soil volume cm 3; RLD). Field data sets of barley grown on stored water in Syria indicated a RLD of about 1 cm cm- 3 is required for extraction of ca. 90 % of the available water, and it was defined as the critical root length density - CRLD (Gregory & Brown, 1989). In field-grown durum wheat and barley, RLD usually exceeds CRLD in the upper soil profile, while below 60 to 80 cm it is typically lower than 1 cm cm- 3. The relationship between RLD in cereal root systems and below-ground resource capture was recently described in a quantitative model (King et al., 2003), linking the size (RLD) and cumulative distribution of the root system with depth (β) to the proportional capture of available water and nitrogen (φ) during grain filling (King et al., 2003). β describes the shape of the cumulative distribution with depth, according to: p = 1 - βd; where p is the fraction of the root system accumulated from the soil surface to a given depth (d). φ is calculated as: φ = 1 – e-k. RLD, where k is the resource capture coefficient (cm 2). The overall aim of the present study was to: (i) identify root traits in barley and durum wheat for improved water and N capture under different intensities of water and/or N stresses, and (ii) quantify responses of root growth, root: shoot partitioning and water and N capture to simulated Mediterranean environments differing in water and N stresses, using controlled-environment experimental conditions. The main hypotheses tested were: 1. 	Mediterranean barley and durum wheat have a similar root system morphology, and comparable cumulative distribution of RLD with depth (βRLD). 2. 	Water and N deficits increase R:S, however total root weight and length will be reduced. 3. 	The proportion of roots deeper in the profile will increase with water and N deficits (higher β). 4. 	k can be defined from the relationship between RLD and φ, and hence a CRLD can be calculated; k should not differ between genotypes and the CRLD will be ca. 1 cm cm- 3. 5. 	 The k value for root volume density (root volume / soil volume; RVD) can be calculated according to King et al. (2003), and critical root volumes (CRVD) for a 90 % water extraction can be calculated. However, RLD will explain a higher proportion of φ for water capture than RVD. 6. 	 Aboveground dry weight (AGDW) and yield (Y) decrease with N and water deficits and there is an interaction between water availability and N fertilizer, such that responses to N are relatively greater under high than low water availability. 7. 	 Water-use efficiency (AGDW / water use; WUE) increases with water stress and N availability, while grain Δ 13 C decreases, and responses are similar for spring barley and durum wheat. 8. 	Nitrogen-use efficiency (grain DM / N available; NUE), N-uptake efficiency (above groung N / N available; NupE) and N-utilization efficiency (grain DM / aboveground N; NutE) will decrease with increasing water deficits and increasing N supply and responses are similar for spring barley and durum wheat. In each of 2006, 2007 and 2008 one glasshouse soil column (15 cm diameter x 150 cm length) experiment was conducted at the University of Nottingham, School of Biosciences, Sutton Bonington Campus, UK (52. 5 o N, 1. 3 o W). The responses of Jordanian spring barley cv. Rum (2006 - 2008) and durum wheat cvs Hourani (2006 - 2007) and Karim (2007) to two levels of irrigation (drought and fully irrigated) and up to three levels of N fertilizer (nil, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1 N, equivalents) were examined. In 2006 and 2007 for each genotype there were six treatment combinations (2 irrigation treatments x 3 fertilizer N levels), in 2008 for barley there were two irrigation treatments at one level of N fertilizer (50 kg N ha- 1, equivalent). The experiments used a factorial randomised block design in three (2006) or five replicates (2007 and 2008). In each experiment, detailed analysis at sequential samplings through the season was carried out, including anthesis and harvest, of root growth and morphology (by root digital image analysis), as well as for the aboveground growth and dry matter partitioning. Water and N uptake were measured and their use-efficiencies evaluated. In 2006, water uptake was gravimetrically measured by weekly weighing a sub-set of soil columns for each treatment. While in 2007 and 2008, water content was weekly measured at different soil-depth intervals using a Theta-T probe (ML 2 x Delta T Devices, Cambridge, UK) via access apertures in columns for a sub-set of columns. WUE was calculated as the AGDW /total water use, from the date of transplantation to harvest and also by the slope of the linear regression of cumulative AGDW on cumulative water uptake through time. This project attempted a comprehensive study of root (and shoot) responses of barley and durum wheat to water and/ or nitrogen stresses, to identify root characteristics for resource acquisition in Mediterranean type environments. However the conditions were atypical of Mediterranean ecosystems. High soil N available (at sowing + mineralization through the season) and/or leaching led to inconsistent and contradictory response to the ones usually found in the literature. Excessive temperatures known to be inhibitory to plant growth and development were felt in the glasshouse, with peaks exceeding 50 ºC. In the field, roots usually experience much lower temperatures below ground. However in these experiments they were subject to the same high temperatures as shoots, this would have had a major impact on the observed root distributions. Moreover, soil in the columns was found to have quite large bulk densities (1. 61, 1. 85 and 1. 76 g cm- 3 in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively), offering a quite high resistance to root growth and consequently shoot growth (Bowen, 1981). To avoid roots growing in the edges, only one plant per soil column was used. However when compared to field grown crops, it only represents an half to a fifth of the plant densities usually found in wheat and barley grown in the Mediterranean. Therefore the usual cropping inter-competition for soil resources was not accounted for. For this reasons the root densities presented in this work might not be representative of those found in the field grown crops, and hence its use has to be cautiously. Due to the large amount of time needed to extract the root system from the soil, and posterior fine cleaning before scanning, only the top (0 – 20 m); mid (60 - 80 cm) and bottom (> 125 cm) of the root system where possible to be analysed. Consequently the total root weight, length and volume, are not real totals but the sum of the layers analysed. Other root morphology parameters, like mean root diameter, specific root length (SRL) and root volume root weight ratio (rV:rW) where calculated in function of those layers. The calculation of the root parameters distribution with depth, using β coefficients (βW - weight, βL – length and βV – volume), was also done taking in account those soil depth sections. This partial analysis can result in a different distribution with depth when compared with a full analysis. Moreover the root shoot ratio (R:S) was estimated using the βW, hence those values may not be the same as if all root system was analysed. Root growth of barley was generally representative of values reported in the literature in the present experiments, but root growth of durum wheat genotypes showed some signs of restriction in the soil columns, particularly in 2007, possibly in part due to the high soil bulk density (BD = 1. 85 g cm- 3). The root to shoot dry weight ratio (R:S) increased with drought, but relatively more for wheat than for barley, so that total root weight (TRW) was actually higher under water limitations for durum wheat than under full irrigation. After anthesis for all genotypes under the droughted treatment, there was a consistent increase in the allocation of root biomass deeper in the soil profile (higher βW). Total root weight (TRW), total root length (TRL) and total root volume (TRV) were well correlated; therefore RWD, RLD and RVD distribution with depth followed similar patterns. Hence, an increase of βL and βV was also found under drought. Beta values for root length were (averaged across 2006, 2007 and 2008) : 0. 97, 0.|$|R
