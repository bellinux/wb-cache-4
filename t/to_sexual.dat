5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> monomorphism; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.|$|E

5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as authentic rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it. Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Male horn {{development}} has been linked <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers and other small antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of competition among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids {{are believed to have}} evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E

5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was {{promulgated by}} President Pranab Mukherjee.

The ordinance {{provides for the}} death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalisation of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, {{but in the case}} of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{has lived}} a {{controversial}} lifestyle, {{during and after}} his playing career. He admitted to using drugs such as cocaine as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended several times by the league for failing drug tests. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. From 1998 to 2009, Taylor lived a sober, drug-free life. He worked as a color commentator on sporting events after his retirement, and pursued a career as an actor. His personal life came under public scrutiny in 2011 when he pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> misconduct involving a 16-year-old girl. After Taylor was put on trial, he was registered as a low-risk sex offender.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck has {{received}} {{attention in the}} media due <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> crimes committed against minors by New Jersey educators.

White had been charged in 2002 with fondling a 17-year-old student and was subsequently acquitted. James Darden, an award-winning former eighth grade teacher at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, was charged with sexual assault and misconduct in June 2007. He pleaded guilty in December 2007 to a charge of aggravated sexual assault and faces up to 8½ years in prison when sentenced on January 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} and the species within has a long and complicated history. Other genera of Oligocene indricotheres, such as Baluchitherium, Indricotherium, and Dzungariotherium, have been named, but no complete specimens exist, making comparison and classification difficult. Most modern scientists consider these genera to be junior synonyms of Paraceratherium, and that it contains at least four discernible species; P. bugtiense (the type species), P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis, although the last may be a distinct genus. The most completely-known species is P. transouralicum, so most reconstructions of the genus are based on it. Differences between P. bugtiense and P. transouralicum may be due <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism, which would make them the same species.|$|E
5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E
5|$|With regard <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may {{be argued}} {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the British {{ecologist}} Anthony S. Cheke {{proposed that}} the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton's parakeets, and that the differences between them were due <b>to</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism. The last bird mentioned had earlier been identified as introduced grey-headed lovebirds (Agapornis canus) by A. Newton, but Cheke did not find this likely, as their beaks are grey. Alexandre Pingré also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some red colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet. None of the existing Newton's parakeet specimens have red patches. The single known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain {{the absence of the}} red patch. When Psittacula are bred by aviculturalists, blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress red colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch.|$|E
