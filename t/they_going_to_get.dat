[...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E

5000|$|Voyagers {{cast members}} had a {{negative}} response to the continued inclusion of the Kazon in the series and felt that their removal was {{the best course of}} action. Tim Russ commented that the frequent incorporation of the species would strain the credibility of the storylines as the crew would have to eventually leave Kazon-controlled space on their journey home. He also believed that the Kazon were failures as antagonists, perceiving them to be insufficiently imposing for the main characters and fans to take them seriously. Ethan Phillips agreed with Russ, suggesting that the Kazons presence should be reduced. Robert Picardo joked that the only interesting aspect of the species was their hairstyle, while Robert Beltran pointed to their lack of intelligence as the main factor preventing them from becoming strong villains. Kate Mulgrew suggested that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need ... to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening.

5000|$|Moore had {{initially}} offered {{to direct the}} documentary, though Madonna enlisted Åkerlund as director since Moore was busy with his own project, Fahrenheit 9/11. Moore later {{said that he could}} help around with the editing and advised Madonna to shoot [...] "as much content as possible". I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was an important film for Madonna, who was determined to show her matured persona through the documentary. She had a meagre budget of one million ($ million in [...] dollars) for production. The singer had to spend time in the editing room with Åkerlund, analyzing all the shots and creating the final version. Side-by-side Madonna had also started working on her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, juggling time between editing the film and recording. Madonna had to fly to Stockholm for the editing and described pruning the 350-hour footage into a two-hour documentary as [...] "exhaustive". She recalled her thoughts during that time:I was sitting there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just worrying the whole way, biting my fingernails off.Before releasing the film, Madonna invited a group of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that there was too much of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q&A session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
