40|$|Graduation date: 1988 It {{has been}} shown by Schlesinger and Mintz (1979) that the UCLA general {{circulation}} model (GCM) is able to simulate the observed negative correlation between the <b>total</b> amount of <b>ozone</b> in a vertical atmospheric column (the <b>total</b> <b>ozone)</b> and the eastward-propagating synoptic disturbances in the troposphere, with the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> maxima and minima located respectively at the troughs and ridges of the tropospheric waves. The goal {{of the present study}} was to understand how the GCM simulated this observed relationship. Our analysis shows that the transient-eddy <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> disturbances were an omnipresent feature of the GCM January simulation in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes, just as they are in nature. It is also found that the transient-eddy <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> disturbances in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes were closely related to the transient-eddy geopotential heights there throughout the entirety of the simulation. Furthermore, the correlations between these two quantities are negative up to the 72 mb level and attain their largest negative values at the 300 mb level. The analysis also shows that the transient-eddy disturbances in the stratosphere are out of phase with their counterparts in the troposphere, in accord with what would be expected from Dines compensation. In the GCM simulation there is a well-defined positive correlation between the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and the <b>ozone</b> <b>content</b> in each of the model layers in the upper troposphere and lower and middle stratosphere. It is found that although layers 5 - 8 (19. 3 - 150 mb) contain the largest percentage of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone,</b> it is predominantly layers 6 - 9 (37. 3 - 300 mb) that make the largest contribution to the temporal variations of <b>total</b> <b>ozone.</b> In accordance with the observations, a strong negative correlation is found between the simulated <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and the height of the simulated tropopause.

The statistical model for estimating daily values of UV-B radiation (developed at Institute of Agrosystems and Bioclimatology at Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno) was used for 88 stations from the Czech Republic.

40|$|<b>Total</b> <b>ozone</b> values {{measured}} by the <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer during January, February, and March 1989 are analyzed. During this period, polar <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> values did not reveal clear depletions, although average winter <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> values indicate that a 2 - 6 percent ozone reduction has occurred in northern mid to high latitudes over the last 10 years. Rapid <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> increases were seen during mid-February, resulting from a wave 2 major stratospheric warming. In order to track polar air over the warming period, <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> trends are further analyzed using Ertel's potential vorticity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe model {{calculations}} of altitude distribution of CN (condensation nuclei), plausible centers of sulfate aerosol formation after {{the occurrence of}} GLE, are presented. Events with relativistic solar protons (i. e. protons with energies > 450 MeV) are observed at ground level by neutron monitors and called ground-level events (GLEs) (Shea and Smart, 2001). Analysis of experimental data and model calculations permits us to explain some distinctions observed in <b>ozone</b> <b>total</b> <b>content</b> (OTC) variations during several GLEs. For example, model simulations show a significant CN concentration enhancement during the May 1990 GLEs of relatively "moderate" magnitude, when polar ozone "mini-holes" (OTC depletions up to 20 %) have been observed, while no OTC variations and considerable aerosol enhancements were seen during more powerful GLEs (4 August 1972, 2 May 1998, 14 July 2000) (Reagan et al., 1981; Shumilov et al., 1995, 2003). Our results demonstrate that "moderate" GLEs may increase aerosol content significantly and cause ozone "mini-hole" creation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instrument}} was launched on the Nimbus 7 satellite in October 1978. This instrument {{is designed to}} measure spatial variations in the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> field. The employed technique {{is an extension of}} the Backscattered Ultraviolet (BUV) <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> method. The TOMS instrument has an improved capability for detailed monitoring of <b>total</b> <b>ozone.</b> The obtained data appear to contain information about dynamical processes in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Investigations are being conducted to determine qualitatively the conditions, if any, where <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> fails as a predictor for tropopause height. Quantitative relations between the dynamic parameters and <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are also being studied...|$|R
