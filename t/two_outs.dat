In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were <b>two</b> <b>outs,</b> and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} with <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the ninth}} inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to record <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|Neither team got {{a hit in}} {{the third}} or fourth innings. The only runners to reach base were Whitey Kurowski and Marion, both on walks. The fifth started that the same way, with Slaughter and Moore flying out. With <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on the hits, {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief. Behrman kept any more runs from scoring, and after another inning in which the Dodgers did not record a hit, the score was 5–1 {{at the end of the}} fifth.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 2009, Bradley {{signed a}} three-year, $30 million {{deal with the}} Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game {{suspension}} for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly in right field and threw it into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning when there were only <b>two</b> <b>outs.</b> The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out with <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> {{in the ninth}} was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E
5|$|With <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> in the 9th {{inning of}} {{a game against the}} Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E

Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in the bottom of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final <b>two</b> <b>outs.</b> This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with <b>two</b> <b>outs.</b> Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{started the}} season with 13 {{consecutive}} saves but blew his first save of the season on May 27 by giving up a three-run inside-the-park home run on a misplayed fly ball by teammate Delmon Young; however, Nathan got <b>two</b> <b>outs</b> to end the 9th inning and the Twins {{went on to win}} the game. By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves and a career best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16.
