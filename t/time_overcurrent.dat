With the increase in penetration of distributed generation that is expected in the coming years, this situation is becoming more pressing. Traditional methods {{of dealing with the}} issue may not be appropriate - upgrading plant is expensive and disruptive, while network reconfiguration can compromise security of supply. Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) are emerging as a potential solution, with installations now taking place in several locations worldwide. The integration of an SFCL into a network involves a number of challenges, particularly concerning the coordination of protection systems. The operation of existing protection schemes may be compromised due to the increased resistance in the network during a fault (in the case of a resistive SFCL). Furthermore, the reduction in fault levels, although desirable, can have a detrimental impact on protection operating times. This paper will consider an existing medium voltage network in the UK, which incorporates distributed generation capacity. The performance of IDMT overcurrent and distance protection schemes will be examined when an SFCL is installed in this network. In particular, the increased operating <b>time</b> of <b>overcurrent</b> relays will be discussed along with grading implications. The impact on distance protection reach will also be examined.

Distributed and decentralized control have been widely applied to computer science research. However, for power system applications, the real-time application of decentralized and distributed control algorithms introduce several challenges. In this dissertation, new algorithms and methods for decentralized control, protection and energy management of Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) and the Active Distribution Network (ADN) are developed to improve the resiliency of the power system. To evaluate the findings of this dissertation, a laboratory-scale integrated Wide WAMPAC and ADN control platform was designed and implemented. The developed platform consists of phasor measurement units (PMU), intelligent electronic devices (IED) and programmable logic controllers (PLC). On top of the designed hardware control platform, a multi-agent cyber-physical interoperability viii framework was developed for real-time verification of the developed decentralized and distributed algorithms using local wireless and Internet-based cloud communication. A novel real-time multiagent system interoperability testbed was developed to enable utility independent private microgrids standardized interoperability framework and define behavioral models for expandability and plug-and-play operation. The state-of-theart power system multiagent framework is improved by providing specific attributes and a deliberative behavior modeling capability.

The main objective of a protection schemes is mainly to keep the power system stable by isolating only the affected components or {{the section of the}} electricity network in which the fault has developed while allowing the rest of the network to continue operating. It {{is important to note that}} the protection equipment does not prevent faults from occurring, but it limits the damaging effect of the fault and protects other healthy equipment. This is only achieved if the protection system of the electrical network involved complies with the requirements and purpose of the electrical protection standards. These requirements include the Operational speed, Reliability, Security and Sensitivity. In conventional substations that are still existing Within the utilities networks, a number of long cables are then used to complete the links between substation equipment in order for them to communicate (hardwired). This method is uneconomical and is being phased out completely in the near future. Over the last few years a new standard for substation automation communication has been developed Within the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the IEC 61850. This standard defines the integration requirements of multi-vendor compliant relays and other lED's for multiple protection schemes as well as control and automation techniques.

40|$|Intentional {{islanding}} {{of electrical}} distribution systems raises potentials for customer {{backup power supply}} in future energy systems. An uncertain amount of additional expenses is needed to ensure an adequate and reliable protection system for the islanded mode of operation. Nowadays, customer installations are mainly equipped with low-cost overcurrent protection devices. Their reliable fault tripping is assumed but is not verified in intentionally islanded grids built by multiple inverter coupled distributed energy resources. It is unknown, whether critical influences and requirements {{need to be taken}} into consideration in addition to a sufficient dimensioning of the sources. Potentially influencing factors are investigated by means of time domain simulations of an islanded low voltage distribution system containing two grid building inverters. One and three phased faults are investigated in main and final circuits of customer installations. A sensitivity analysis varies up to 32 factors simultaneously from the areas grid structure and parameters, dimensioning of inverters, inverter neutral current injection capability as well as structure and parameters of LCL-filters, control circuits, current limiting mechanisms and anti-windup. For the first time, these variation studies consider an increasing degree of inhomogeneity of structure and parameter settings and exploit a significant bandwidth of values per setting. A rule based procedure is created as a precondition for parameterizing the overall model and the control circuits. Adequate variants of inverter current reference limiting mechanisms are identified by means of a developed test procedure. For the first time, according mechanisms are systematically derived for grid building inverters with neutral current injection capability. Reliable tripping of overcurrent protection devices is achievable for single wire final circuits with tripping times lower than 400 ms, when a successful fault ride through can be ensured for an adequate quantity of grid building inverters. The required installed rated inverter currents are in the range from 0. 92 to 1. 18 <b>times</b> the <b>overcurrent</b> protection device’s tripping current. Influencing factors are the current limiting mechanisms used, the type of overcurrent protection installed and the inhomogeneity of inverter control structures present. Faults in main circuits experience a critical influence by a loss of transient stability during the fault (desynchronization) due to the resulting longer prospective tripping times. A reliable protection tripping is then impeded by the resulting gradual or cyclic reduction of the total fault current available. In case of three phased faults, the development over time can be estimated by a small number of factors. For one phased faults, an increase of the number of desynchronizing cases is observed with increasing degree of structural inhomogeneity. Dependable tripping is potentially achievable, when mechanisms for reliably avoiding desynchronization are utilized. In that case, an adequate number of inverters must ride through the fault. A fault ride through capability of the grid building inverters requires those to supply and tolerate phase voltages in the range of zero to 1. 08 *sqrt(3) p. u. and line-line voltages up to 1. 175 p. u. Partial loading and reverse power capabilities are required from the inverter coupled distributed energy resources.

The harmonic analysis versatility is that any periodic signal may be synthesized from harmonic oscillation of certain amplitude, frequency and initial phase. A mathematical model for determining the phase current harmonic content of power supply networks with isolated neutral and non-linear loads types and, as a consequence, the distortion of sinusoidal phase current change is developed by multiplying the analog current in time dependency on the grate delta-function with different sampling intervals, in which the use of simple and widely used in relay protection units, in particular electronic overcurrent relays, mathematical operations of integration squares instantaneous current allows the most in harmony with the mathematical tools to build other network protection types.

With the recent growth in wireless communication technologies, wireless Ethernet or Wireless LAN (WLAN), standardized in IEEE 802. 11, is gaining {{interest in the}} power industry for substation automation applications, especially at the distribution level. Low Voltage (LV) / Medium Voltage (MV) distribution substations have comparatively low time-critical performance requirements. At the same time, expensive but high data-rate fiber-based Ethernet networks {{may not be a}} feasible solution for the MV/LV distribution network. Extensive work is carried out to assess wireless LAN technologies for various IEC 61850 based smart distribution substation applications: control and monitoring; automation and metering; and over-current protection. First, the investigation of wireless LANs for various smart distribution substation applications was initiated with radio noise-level measurements in total five (27. 6 and 13. 8 kV) substations owned by London Hydro and Hydro One in London, ON, Canada. The measured noise level from a spectrum analyzer was modeled using the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) tool in MATLAB, and parameters for these models in the 2. 4 GHz band and 5. 8 GHz band were obtained. Further, this measured noise models were used to simulate substation environment in OPNET (the industry-trusted communication networking simulation) tool. In addition, the efforts for developing dynamic models of WLAN-enabled IEC 61850 devices were initiated using Proto-C programming in OPNET tool. The IEC 61850 based devices, such as Protection and Control (P 2 ̆ 6 C) Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and Merging Unit (MU) were developed based on the OSI- 7 layer stack proposed in IEC 61850. The performance of various smart distribution substation applications was assessed in terms of average and maximum message transfer delays and throughput. The work was extended by developing hardware prototypes of WLAN enabled IEC 61850 devices in the R 2 ̆ 6 D laboratory at University of Western Ontario, Canada. P 2 ̆ 6 C IED, MU, Processing IED, and Echo IED were developed using industrial embedded computers over the QNX Real Time Operating System (RTOS) platform. The functions were developed using hard real-time multithreads, timers, and so on to communicate IEC 61850 application messages for analyzing WLAN performance in terms of Round Trip Time (RTT) and throughput.

However, along with these benefits, DG can also have an adverse impact on operation of the power systems. For example, voltage regulation, power system stability and protection coordination can be affected due to connection of DG to DNs. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate {{the potential impact of}} DG on the protection setup of DNs and to suggest solutions to solve these problems for safe integration of DG. The thesis analyzes the potential impacts of DG on DN protection {{with the help of a}} case study of DG installation in a typical DN. The issues discussed include increase in the fault current level, blinding of protection, sympathetic tripping, reduction in reach of a distance relay, lack of detection of single-phase to ground (1 LG) fault with ungrounded utility side interconnection transformer configuration and failure of a fuse saving scheme. In respect of the case study, practical and effective solutions that rely on conventional protection devices and practices, for example, instantaneous overcurrent relay, zero sequence voltage detection and transfer trip scheme are proposed. A novel protection strategy that combines the characteristics of both the <b>time</b> and instantaneous <b>overcurrent</b> elements along with a simple algorithm for adaptively changing the setting of the latter is proposed to ensure proper recloser-fuse coordination even in the presence of DG. Conventional protection schemes face serious challenges when they are considered for protecting an islanded microgrid having an inverter interfaced DG unit and need major revision in order to detect and isolate the faulty portion, as fault currents are very limited in such systems. Protection coordination issues including lack of sensitivity and selectivity in isolation of a fault can occur in a microgrid, especially in an islanded mode of operation. The thesis presents and critically reviews traditional and state of the art protection strategies in respect of a microgrid protection. Total harmonic distortion (THD) based islanding detection schemes that measure the output current THD of the inverter interfaced DG (IIDG) are discussed and the role of various factors like uncertainties in filter parameters, variations in the utility THD and the utility impedance on the performance of these schemes is investigated. The simulation results show that the THD in the inverter output current may be affected (depending upon the design of the controller) by the variations in the utility THD and the utility impedance. Consequently, the working of THD based schemes may suffer if these factors are not taken into consideration while selecting the trip threshold. A large L 2 (the inductor of the LCL filter facing the grid) can make the output current THD of the inverter less sensitive to variations in the utility impedance and, thus, makes the selection of the trip threshold easier. Moreover, through simulations it is shown that electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) capacitors can also affect the islanding detection schemes used for IIDG as they can introduce a large increase in the output current THD of the inverter.

Protection systems in conventional U. S. distribution systems are radial {{with the assumption that}} current flows always from the utility source to the end user. However, in a microgrid with distributed generators, currents along power lines do not always flow in one direction. Therefore, protection systems must be adapted to different circuit paths depending on distributed generator sites in the microgrid and maximum fuse ampere ratings on busses. Adaptive overcurrent protection focuses on objectives and constraints based on operation, maximum load demand, equipment, and utility service limitations. Adaptive overcurrent protection was designed to protect the power lines and bus feeders of the microgrid with distributed generators by coordinating fuses and relays in the microgrid. Adaptive overcurrent protection was based on the relay setting group and protection logic methods. Non-real-time simulator (NRTS) and real-time simulator (RTS) experiments were performed with computer-based simulators. Tests with two relays in the loop proved that primary relays tripped faster than backup relays for selectivity coordination in the adaptive overcurrent protection system. Relay test results from tripping and non-tripping tests showed that adaptive inverse <b>time</b> <b>overcurrent</b> protection achieved selectivity, speed, and reliability. The RTS and NRTS with two relays in the loop techniques were described and compared in this work. The author was the first graduate student to implement real-time simulation with two relays in the loop at the Burns & McDonnell - K-State Smart Grid Laboratory. The RTS experimental circuit and project are detailed in this work so other graduate students can apply this technique with relays in the loop in smart grid research areas such as phasor measurement units, adaptive protection, communication, and cyber security applications...|$|E

Although they work well with sinusoidal waveforms, there is little published information on their characteristics. Due to shunt connected non-linear devices, {{not the least of which}} is the use of power electronic equipment, the supply is distorted. Consequently, RCCBs as well as other protection relays are subject to non-sinusoidal current waveforms. Recent studies showed that RCCBs are greatly affected by harmonics, however the reasons for this are not clear. A literature search has also shown that there are inconsistencies in the analysis of the effect of harmonics on protection relays. In this work, the way RCCBs operate is examined, then a model is built with the aim of assessing the effect of non-sinusoidal current on RCCBs. Tests are then carried out on a number of RCCBs and these, when compared with the results from the model showed good correlation. In addition, the model also enables us to explain the RCCBs characteristics for pure sinusoidal current. In the model developed, various parameters are evaluated but special attention is paid to the instantaneous value of the current and the tripping mechanism movement. A similar assessment method is then used to assess the effect of harmonics on two types of protection relay, the electromechanical instantaneous relay and <b>time</b> <b>overcurrent</b> relay. A model is built for each of them which is then simulated on the computer. Tests results compare well with the simulation results, and thus the model developed can be used to explain the relays behaviour in a harmonics environment. The author's models, analysis and tests show that RCCBs and protection relays are affected by harmonics in a way determined by the waveform and the relay constants. The method developed provides a useful tool and the basic methodology to analyse the behaviour of RCCBs and protection relays in a harmonics environment. These results have many implications, especially the way RCCBs and relays should be tested if harmonics are taken into account...|$|E
