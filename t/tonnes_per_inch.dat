50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
