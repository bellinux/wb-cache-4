5000|$|On this {{interpretation}} of Eadie, capacity remains subjectively tested in principle, but the practical {{implementation of the}} test must accommodate the reality that {{the policy of the}} law, with regard <b>to</b> <b>provoked</b> killings, “must be one of reasonable restraint.” It may, writes Burchell, ...|$|R
5|$|The Wells {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality.

5|$|Bakshi's film sparked enough {{interest}} in Tolkien's work <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> {{not only an}} animated TV special produced by the Rankin-Bass animation studio based on The Return of the King, but a complete adaptation of The Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio. For this broadcast, Michael Graham Cox and Peter Woodthorpe reprised their roles of Boromir and Gollum, respectively.|$|E

As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of the robbers. Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> Russell and judges that the man is not a killer. However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.|$|E

5000|$|One {{problem for}} {{understanding}} action selection is determining {{the level of}} abstraction used for specifying an [...] "act". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell <b>to</b> <b>provoking</b> a war. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.|$|R
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border.

When the vessel went aground and require a time of 8 months to repair the ship, the delay is too long, the cargo can be shipped by another charter in a much shorter time.

5000|$|In 2006, the {{phenomenon}} first received public attention {{when it was}} asked by many people prior to the July 6 online conference with the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

How do you regard MEDVED?" [...] However, the hosts did not ask him the question.|$|R
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed. The {{religious}} houses {{had been the}} only support of the impoverished, and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> the great northern rising of 1536–1537, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
5|$|These factors {{combined}} with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal {{to create the}} case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary {{for the good of}} the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.|$|E

5|$|After rising {{tensions}} with Mexico following the United States' annexation of Texas, {{war broke out}} in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier. Before the war, President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana {{as part of the}} Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat {{for the first time on}} May 8, 1846, at the Battle of Palo Alto.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{could keep the}} German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E

Tommen is {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> him, but Cersei says he is dangerous because he has no respect for the Crown. Tommen tells Cersei that Margaery's walk of atonement will happen soon. Cersei relays the information to Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell in the Small Council chamber. Tyrell is horrified and pledges her army to defeat the Sparrows. Kevan has been ordered not to attack by Tommen, but agrees to stand down his army after Cersei says that by destroying the Sparrows he can have back his son Lancel, who {{is part of the}} order, and that Tommen will forgive him when he has Margaery back.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese {{did not attempt to}} attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|Goodridge {{gave the}} {{portrait}} to statesman Daniel Webster, {{who was a}} frequent subject and possibly a lover, {{following the death of}} his wife; she may have intended <b>to</b> <b>provoke</b> him into marrying her. Although Webster married someone else, his family held onto the portrait until the 1980s, when it was auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Gloria and Richard Manney in 1981. The couple donated or sold the miniatures of their art collection, including Beauty Revealed, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006.|$|E
