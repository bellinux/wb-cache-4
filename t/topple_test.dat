50|$|This {{procedure}} {{has proved}} controversial in the UK, where an authority's {{duty of care}} to protect visitors is complicated because it often {{does not have any}} ownership rights over the dangerous marker. Authorities that have knocked over stones during testing or have unilaterally lifted and laid flat any potentially hazardous stones have been criticised, after grieving relatives have discovered that their relative's marker has been moved. Since 2007 Consistory Court and local authority guidance now restricts the force used in a <b>topple</b> <b>test</b> and requires an authority to consult relatives before moving a stone. In addition, before laying a stone flat, it must be recorded for posterity.|$|E
40|$|The slope {{stability}} of the Itakpe Iron Ore Mine {{has been carried out}} using computer software, ROCKPACK III. One hundred and twenty three dip and dip direction values were obtained using compass clinometer. The Itakpe Iron Ore Mine was divided into four benches; 241 - 258 m, 263 - 275 m, 276 - 286 m and 308 - 312 m. Joints along the discontinuities were mapped. The data obtained were analyzed using ROCKPACK III. The results indicate that the discontinuities within the critical zone are potentially unstable and can lead to planar failure. The Markland test carried out for wedge failure indicates that the intersection of the discontinuities does not fall within the critical zone hence there cannot be any wedge failure of the slope within the level 241 - 258 m. The presence of discontinuities that plot within the toppling critical zone indicates that there is potential toppling failure on the slope at the 276 - 286 m level. In addition, the <b>toppling</b> failure <b>test</b> shows the absence of discontinuities that plot within the toppling critical zone and this indicates the absence of poten-tial toppling failure of the slope at the 308 - 312 m level. The result of the study will be useful to the man-agement of the Itakpe iron ore mine in having a proper understanding of the failure mechanism of the slopes...|$|R
40|$|Some Gulf of Mexico (GOM) wells {{destroyed}} by hurricanes have become environment and safety hazard and cannot be abandoned by conventional methods since pumping and circulating cement into the casing is impossible when the platforms {{have been completely}} destroyed and <b>toppled.</b> This project <b>tested</b> the curing properties of several epoxy resin systems in different environments. A bisphenol-F/epichlorohydrin (BPF) resin cured by curing agent MBOEA system was successfully tested in the laboratory as a potential plugging material to abandon wells destroyed in the GOM. The BPF/MBOEA resin system had the most suitable curing time in a synthetic seawater environment. The system could be successfully weighted by barite up to 16. 8 ppg and cured properly. Weighting allows the resin system fall more efficiently through the casing annulus. This laboratory verification of properties will lead to field test in the test wells...|$|R
