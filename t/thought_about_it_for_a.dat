500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought {{the news to}} the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes and then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that [...] "I have understood everything." [...] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded {{that it was the}} uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on [...] "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E

5000|$|Weitz had {{the story}} idea for many years, {{but it never}} fully formed until he met and worked with Tomlin on Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the {{character}} really clicked, I had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years, so I {{had a lot of}} it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." ...|$|R
60|$|Freddy sat {{thinking}} on the seat under the trees. It was a wide, white seat, about four feet long, sloping from the sides to the middle, something like a swing; and was not only comfortable but curious, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was made of a whale's bone. Freddy often sat there, and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{he was very much}} interested in it, and nobody could tell him any thing of it, except that it had been there a long time.|$|R

50|$|In 1919, Premchand {{obtained}} a BA degree from Allahabad. By 1921, {{he had been}} promoted to Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February 1921, he attended a meeting in Gorakhpur, where Mahatma Gandhi asked people to resign from government jobs {{as part of the}} non-cooperation movement. Premchand, although physically unwell and with two kids and a pregnant wife to support, <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 5 days and decided, with the consent of his wife, to resign from his government job.|$|R
5000|$|The son of Indian dance pioneer Uday Shankar, Ananda Shankar left Bombay in {{the late}} 1960s for California, where his uncle, Indian {{classical}} musician and composer Ravi Shankar, had been based since 1967. Ananda spent time in San Francisco before settling in Los Angeles, where he became immersed in the psychedelic music scene. A trained sitarist, he began playing with rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who suggested that they record an album together in 1968. According to Shankar, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> three days but declined Hendrix's offer, reasoning that [...] "it wouldn't be my music. So I made the album alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{documentary}} [...] "The Untold Saga of The Evil Dead" [...] Rob Tapert states that New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures had {{said they wanted}} to do Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason: [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> one second but we knew we would have totally trashed the franchise in doing that, in {{that there would be no}} reason to reunite Bruce and Sam for Evil Dead 4 whatever that would be nor would there be any reason to go back and reinvent the original Evil Dead with a hot new filmmaker". A comic book series was produced based on this concept, titled Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors.|$|R
6000|$|Trot <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Then {{she remembered}} how some unknown man had escaped from the palace the night before {{by means of the}} wall, which he had reached from the window of the very chamber in which she had slept. Cap'n Bill might easily do the same. And the rope ladder she had used would help the sailor down {{from the top of the}} wall. [...] "Could you climb down a rope ladder, Cap'n?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|The Duchess <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. She {{certainly}} {{could not tell}} Lord Rufford {{to speak to the}} Duke without getting the Duke's leave to tell him so. And then, if all this were done, and Lord Rufford were to assure the Duke that the young lady had made a mistake, how derogatory would all that be to the exalted quiescence of the house of Mayfair! She thoroughly wished that her niece were out of the house; for though she did believe the story, her belief was not thorough. [...] "I will speak to your uncle," [...] she said. [...] "And now you had better go to sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thompson <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment before}} he spoke. There was {{room in the}} fly for only two, or if for three, still he knew his place better than to thrust himself inside {{together}} with his prisoner and his prisoner's wife. He had been specially asked by Mr. Walker to be very civil. Only one could sit on the box with the driver, and if the request was conceded the poor policeman must walk back. The walk, however, would not kill the policeman. [...] "All right, ma'am," [...] said Thompson;--"that is, if the gentleman will just pass his word not to get out till I ask him." ...|$|E
5000|$|For all the {{conviction}} that Lang brings to Turn Around, the album began almost as an afterthought. Lang was in the studio one day with his producer, Ron Fair, who is also president of A&M/Interscope Records. There wasn't anything pressing on the agenda; they were doing routine work on {{the final stages of}} Lang's previous record, Long Time Coming. Then, out of the blue, Fair said something completely unexpected."He looks at me and goes, `Dude, you need to make a gospel record,'" [...] Lang says, laughing at the recollection. [...] "Now, I hadn't really mentioned much to Ron about that side of my life, but for some reason he knew where I was at. So I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> just a second and said, `Yes, I do.'" ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> two hours before telling him to go <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Now, {{it looks like a}} great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|R
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked what}} they would do if he induced his comrades to {{surrender}}. Kelly stated, [...] "I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, [...] "You can depend on us." [...] Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly [...] "lagged" [...] at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.|$|R
6000|$|The {{words were}} no sooner {{out of his}} mouth, than Mr. Glascock knew, and remembered, and felt what he had said. There are {{occasions}} in which a man sins so deeply against fitness and {{the circumstances of the}} hour, that it becomes impossible for him to slur over his sin as though it had not been committed. There are certain little peccadilloes in society which one can manage to throw behind one,--perhaps with some difficulty, and awkwardness; but still they are put aside, and conversation goes on, though with a hitch. But there are graver offences, the gravity of which strikes the offender so seriously that it becomes impossible for him to seem even to ignore his own iniquity. Ashes must be eaten publicly, and sackcloth worn before the eyes of men. It was so now with poor Mr. Glascock. He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment,--whether or no it was possible that he should continue his remarks about the American ladies, without betraying his own consciousness of the thing that he had done; and he found that it was quite impossible. He knew that he was red up to his hairs, and hot, and that his blood tingled. His blushes, indeed, would not be seen in the seclusion of the banquette; but he could not overcome the heat and the tingling. There was silence for about three minutes, and then he felt that it would be best for him to confess his own fault. [...] "Trevelyan," [...] he said, [...] "I am very sorry for the allusion that I made. I ought to have been less awkward, and I beg your pardon." ...|$|E
5000|$|I hadn’t even <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of}} years, and he goes, [...] "Well yes, {{as a matter}} of fact, I just got a letter from him. Do you feel like helping a down-on-his-luck folk singer?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. I {{thought maybe}} I should release it as The Black Hole {{and put the}} demos in the right order, but like I said, it was never finished, so it wouldn't really stand up, like it wouldn't {{be a very good}} listen... It was a very tough decision, but in the end I {{concluded}} that this is the best possible CD I could put out, given all the material I have. This is the best listen and this is what I want to give to the world.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|R
5000|$|Dickinson states he got {{the idea}} for his [...] "pseudo-scientific monograph" [...] after looking at a dragon {{illustration}} on the cover of an omnibus edition of Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy: This one had a bulky body and rather stubby wings, which obviously would never get it airborne, let alone with the two people it was carrying on its back, and all its own weight of muscle and bone. Obviously any lift had to come from the body itself. Its very shape suggested some kind of gas-bag. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the journey, and on and off {{for a couple of days}} after, and at the end of that time had managed to slot everything I knew about dragons - why they laired in caves, around which nothing would grow and where hoards of gold could be found, why they had a preferred diet of princesses, how and why they breathed fire, why they had only one vulnerable spot and their blood melted the blade of the sword that killed them, and so on - into a coherent theory that explained why these things were necessary accompaniments to the evolution of lighter-than-air flight.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} he woke up and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} his life, knew what it was to feel really acutely irritable, in a misery of real bad temper. After bawling and snarling at Tilly, he took himself off for very shame, to be alone. And looking at the ashen fields and the putty roads, he {{wondered}} what in the name of Hell he could do to get out of this prickly sense of disgust and physical repulsion. And he knew that this was the result of his glorious evening.|$|R
5000|$|On October 17, 2012, he {{announced}} that he would be legally changing his name from Kim Junsu to Kim Minjun due to family reasons. In a 2014 interview with Starcast, he discussed the change: [...] "There are still hateful comments about me changing my name. It is a name which my father gave it to me in advance before he passed away after thinking when to give it to me. I talked about it for 8 months with my mother. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time since changing name didn't feel good to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In his {{autobiography}} Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan {{wrote about the}} song's recording,"Although Lanois liked the song, he liked the bridge better, wanted the whole song to be like that. I knew what he meant, but it just couldn't be done. Though I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second, thinking that I could probably start with the bridge as the main part and use the main part as the bridge...the idea didn't amount to much and thinking about the song this way wasn't healthy. I {{felt like it was}} fine the way it was — didn't want to lose myself in thinking too much about changing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of Born into the 90's, as the member of the R&B group Public Announcement, Kelly began touring as an opening act for Gerald Levert and Glenn Jones. During the tour, Kelly said that he became {{frustrated}} with the poor lighting and empty seats during his set. To generate more attention during his set, Kelly begin thinking {{of what would be}} his gimmick to take his show to the next level, something that would make people remember him. Kelly stated: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of days, and I finally came up with a little skit, me just talking to the audience. At the point in the show where I would break down [...] "Honey Love," [...] I would start talking to the audience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have worked}} {{all sorts of}} {{traverses}} {{to get hold of}} this matter, and never could make any thing of it. It is harder than logarithms. If my father had been the only one to teach it, I should have <b>thought</b> less <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>for</b> he was no scholar, and might have been paying it out just in the way of business; but then my mother believed it, body and soul, and she was too good a woman to stick long to a course that had not truth to back it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upset {{that such}} an enjoyable {{experience}} {{would no longer be}} available to them, a group of Alleyn's boys - some of whom were still at the school, some also leaving that year, and some who had already left by then - asked him if it might be possible for them to reunite over the summer holidays to put on a Shakespeare play of their own. He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> some time, and finally decided to try it out, but not just for the Alleyn's boys. His rather vague vision, as he put it later, was [...] "...to bring young actors together in their school holiday to take part in serious productions in the hope of encouraging young people in general to take more interest in the theatre. Even more vaguely, I hoped that the Youth Theatre, as I was already calling it in my mind, would develop a real sense of community by bringing together young people from diverse backgrounds to work in a group where even the humblest mattered. I hoped too that the work would encourage them to look upon the theatre as being as much part of their lives as football or dancing, instead of something reserved for the precious or privileged few." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I beheld, {{with the}} deepest interest, a {{magnificent}} lake with beautiful islets scattered over its crystal breast. Often had I read of the mirage of African deserts, and much had I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Now, <b>for</b> the first time, {{it was before}} me. Never was deception more perfect. If I had not known that no such lake existed in the region I should have been almost ready to stake my life on {{the reality of what}} I saw. No wonder that thirsty travellers in unknown regions should have so often pushed forward in eager pursuit of this beautiful phantom.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{they had}} <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{it was not}} until Jennifer's daughter, Emme, {{experienced}} a medical scare, when they went ahead with creating the foundation. When Emme was three weeks old, a bump was discovered on her head. She {{was rushed to the hospital}} where an MRI scan was performed, but she was given the okay. Jennifer said at the Noche de Niños gala: [...] "I started to wonder, what if I couldn't afford a doctor or receive the medicines, the procedures?" [...] It was after this when she joined forces with the Los Angeles Children's hospital. In December 2011, she said of the situation: [...] "What if I didn't have that? What if I didn't have access to great health care? What if I was a mom just sitting there and there was something wrong with my baby and there was nothing I could do about it?" [...] She felt that there were mothers out there that didn't have the luxuries she did, and wanted to help.|$|E

We were talking about The City and what to do with that timeslot. I said, 'If I were a programmer, I would start the ABC lineup with a half hour of the west wing of General Hospital with the interns in a learning hospital, and cap the day off with General Hospital. I would interface the characters in Port Charles with both wings of General Hospital.' Pat thought that was a great idea. She <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few hours, ran it by upper management, and told me to write it up. I sat down, wrote down some characters and storylines, sent her back some pages, and created the show. That was a natural bridge as a programmer. I had worked as a programmer at ABC and FOX so my head also thinks in those terms. We wanted to bring continuity to the show, which was Lucy, Kevin, and Scotty."

60|$|But for the {{reference}} {{at the end}} of this strange note, I should certainly have considered it as a mere trap set to make a fool of me by some mischievous friend.
