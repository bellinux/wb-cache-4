25|$|These {{vehicles}} {{could be}} divided into three sub-categories. Modified trucks equipped with water cannons, modified stock cars and modified APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers). Their function is to help control riots. Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans. APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that unfold to create barriers. The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters. Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye (to mark <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> present for later apprehension). Previously fire trucks were used as anti-riot vehicles of this type. As a non lethal, and effective method of clearing out protesters or rioters, the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) can be used. The LRAD is a device that can send announcements, warnings, and harmful pain-inducing tones.|$|E

According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute.

2500|$|If God is ever to {{wipe away}} the tears {{from the face of}} man this age-long wrong [...] must be overthrown.
