Some led us and laid our hands upon them, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> {{they were well}} {{and that we were}} guilty of afflicting them; whereupon we were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the justice of the peace and {{forthwith}} carried to Salem."The Rev. John Hale explained how this supposedly worked: [...] "the Witch by the cast of her eye sends forth a Malefick Venome into the Bewitched to cast him into a fit, and therefore the touch of the hand doth by sympathy cause that venome to return into the Body of the Witch again".|$|E
2500|$|According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, {{brought about}} by Harris's idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying that [...] "I was {{probably}} responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek." [...] Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he [...] "might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or something ... I wanted something that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, and so I just wanted something distant. And <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> on the back, 'Could you stick all the other Eddies in the ice?' So I did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then {{the elders}} of the {{congregation}} said, [...] "What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?" [...] And they said, [...] "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, {{for the children of}} Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, {{on the east side of}} the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." [...] Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, [...] "Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'" [...] And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.|$|E
60|$|Every {{man looked}} round upon every other man, as if Dick {{might have been}} transmuted into one or the other; and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they didn't know.|$|E
60|$|This {{was another}} obstacle. They finally {{convinced}} {{him that it was}} necessary to have the accused in court. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they would send a guard to bring him.|$|E
5000|$|The Oliver Twins {{said in an}} interview, on the British {{television}} show [...] "When Games Attack", that Dizzy was originally {{not supposed to be}} an egg at all but just a face with hands and feet. <b>They</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> accepted everyone thought he was an egg and decided to go with that.|$|R
50|$|If two {{aircraft}} are not laterally separated, and are following tracks within 45 degrees {{of each other}} (or the reciprocal), <b>then</b> <b>they</b> are <b>said</b> to be following the same route and some form of longitudinal separation must exist.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Harris said. [...] "They {{really believe}} they're plants. I put {{them through the}} {{high-frequency}} shock treatment, the shock box. The whole nervous system is paralyzed, all inhibitions stopped cold. They tell the truth, <b>then.</b> And <b>they</b> <b>said</b> the same thing--and more." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{talked a}} long while together, Brangwen {{flushing}} like a girl when the other did not understand his idiom. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> good night, and shook hands. Again the foreigner bowed and repeated his good night.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> {{to wait a}} moment, and one {{policeman}} went forth {{into the}} night while I warmed myself at the stove, all the while racking my brains for the trap {{they were going to}} spring on me.|$|E
6000|$|Then the hares set out, taking Letiko with them, {{and because}} it was a long way to her home they became hungry by the way. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> to the little girl: 'Climb this tree, dear Letiko, and remain there till we have {{finished}} eating.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they reached}} their homes {{they took it}} to the council-lodge, and hung it up before the fire, {{fastening}} it with raw hide soaked, which would shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire.

6000|$|So {{him and the}} dervish laid into it, {{and they}} loaded every camel till he couldn't carry no more; <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> good-bye, {{and each of them}} started off with his fifty.

6000|$|Meanwhile the King and the Prince were {{considering}} {{how they should}} find the King of the Peacocks, if {{there was such a}} person in the world.

50|$|On 7 March 1997, President Museveni {{wrote to}} United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan {{describing}} {{the plight of}} the Aboke girls. In June 1997, Sr. Rachele and members of the CPA met with LRA commanders in Juba, Sudan. After originally denying that they held the girls, <b>they</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> would release them if the Ugandan military declared a ceasefire. The Ugandan government rejected the proposal and stated that they were not responsible for anything that may happen to the girls.|$|R

60|$|They called again, {{and at last}} {{made out}} that the Englishman was above them. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> {{they were going to}} try to get to him and {{commenced}} the struggle.

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> to one another: [...] "Either that knight is now dead, {{or else he}} will perish {{when the}} tide rises and covers the rocks; so to-night we will do no more with this business; but to-morrow we will go and find his body where it lies among the rocks of the shore."

6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{returned}} Tom, 'certainly.

60|$|Miss Triscoe {{was with}} her father, and Mrs. March was herself chaperoned by Mr. Burnamy: her husband had refused {{to come to the}} entertainment. She hoped to leave Burnamy and Miss Triscoe {{together}} before the evening ended; but Miss Triscoe merely stopped with her father, in quitting the saloon, to laugh at some features of the entertainment, as people who take no part in such things do; Burnamy stood up to exchange some unimpassioned words with her, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> good-night.|$|E

60|$|All {{manner of}} {{questions}} {{were then asked}} and answered respecting their different journeys. Constantinople was described on one side, and the Tyrol; {{and on the other}} the perils of the ride to Jaffa, the discomforts of the Austrian boat to Alexandria, and the manners of the ladies from India with whom Miss Baker and her niece had travelled in their passage from Egypt to Marseilles. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> something about uncle George--not that Miss Baker so called him--and Bertram said that he had learnt that Miss Baker had been staying at Hadley.|$|E
5000|$|The NFL {{paid little}} {{attention}} to the game's development until just before the launch.
