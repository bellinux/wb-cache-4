40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove a new {{upper bound on}} {{learning}} monotone DNF formulae in an exact learning model called the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> model. This model, introduced {{in one of our}} earlier works, uses <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> classes for classifying the complexity of learning problems. <b>Teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> classes are a learning-theoretic analog of complexity classes. We show that monotone DNF are learnable using a <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> in the class SPP. On the other hand, concept classes such as k-CNF or Boolean circuits are not learnable using an SPP <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> unless Np SPP.

On March 10, the contract faculty ratified a new agreement, but the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and graduate assistants rejected tentative agreements the bargaining team had reached with the university. The contract faculty immediately returned to work and, at that point, the university gradually restarted nearly all courses.

In [3] we show that the exact learnability of some algebraic concept classes can be more sharply classified in this model than in Angluin's model. The <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> model {{can be seen as}} an enhancement of Angluin's model. The new ingredient is that apart from the learner and teacher there is a third agent called <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> which acts as an intermediary between the learner and teacher. In this paper we investigate in detail the learnability of various concept classes in the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> model.
