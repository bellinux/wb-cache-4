40|$|Self-rated health (SRH) <b>trajectories</b> tend {{to decline}} over a lifetime. Moreover, the Cumulative Advantage and Disadvantage (CAD) model {{indicates}} that SRH <b>trajectories</b> {{are known to}} consistently diverge along socioeconomic positions (SEP) over the life course. However, studies of working adults to consider the influence of work and family conflict (WFC) on SRH <b>trajectories</b> are scarce. We test the CAD model and hypothesise that SRH <b>trajectories</b> diverge over time according to socioeconomic positions and WFC <b>trajectories</b> accentuate this divergence. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel (N = 2327 working respondents surveyed from 2004 to 2010), we first examine <b>trajectories</b> of SRH and potential divergence over time across age, gender, SEP and family status using latent growth curve analysis. Second, we assess changes in SRH <b>trajectories</b> in relation to changes in WFC <b>trajectories</b> and divergence in SRH <b>trajectories</b> according to gender, SEP and family status using parallel latent growth curve analysis. Three measures of WFC are used: exhaustion after work, difficulty disconnecting from work, and work interference in private family obligations. The results show that SRH <b>trajectories</b> slowly decline over time and {{that the rate of}} change is not influenced by age, gender or SEP, a result which does not support the CAD model. SRH <b>trajectories</b> are significantly correlated with exhaustion after work <b>trajectories</b> but not the other two WFC measures. When exhaustion after work <b>trajectories</b> are taken into account, SRH <b>trajectories</b> of higher educated people decline slower compared to less educated people, supporting the CAD hypothesis...|$|R

He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile <b>trajectory</b> of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's <b>trajectory</b> from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

40|$|Shuffle on <b>trajectories</b> was {{introduced}} by Mateescu et al. [147] {{as a method of}} generalizing sev-eral studied operations on words, such as the shuffle, concatenation and insertion operations. This natural construction has received significant and varied attention in the literature. In this thesis, we consider several unexamined areas related to shuffle on <b>trajectories.</b> We first examine the state complexity of the shuffle on <b>trajectories.</b> We find that the density of the set of <b>trajectories</b> is an appropriate measure of the complexity of the associated operation, since low density sets of <b>trajectories</b> yield less complex operations. We introduce the operation of deletion along <b>trajectories,</b> which serves as an inverse to shuffle on <b>trajectories.</b> The operation is also of independent interest, and we examine its closure properties. The study of deletion along <b>trajectories</b> also leads to the study of language equations and systems of language equations with shuffle on <b>trajectories.</b> The notion of shuffle on <b>trajectories</b> also has applications to the theory of codes. Each shuffle on <b>trajectories</b> operation defines a class of languages. Several of these language classes are important in the theory of codes, including the prefix-, suffix-, biprefix-codes and the hypercodes. We investigat...|$|R

40|$|Sampling rare, short-time, and {{reactive}} <b>trajectories</b> is {{of considerable}} interest in molecular simulations. These <b>trajectories,</b> {{which are also}} called “activated”, hop between stable states separated by energy or entropy barriers. Simulations of activated <b>trajectories</b> with random sampling of initial conditions are inefficient, since most initial conditions lead to <b>trajectories</b> that do not pass the barrier in short times. A boundary value formulation is proposed that selects these rare <b>trajectories,</b> making the sampling of point-to-point reactive <b>trajectories</b> more effective. Earlier boundary value formulations by one of us focused on computations of approximate <b>trajectories.</b> In the proposed method, <b>trajectories</b> are accurate even when we employ a relatively large integration step (by a factor of about 100 compared to initial value methods).
