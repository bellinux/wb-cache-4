[...] Laird, a former US Army {{sergeant}} who served on Attu, stated that he was sleeping in a tent the morning of May 30 when Yamasaki's troops broke through the American front lines. [...] A man ran into Laird's tent and Laird shot and killed him, {{only to discover that}} the man was American. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> eight Japanese soldiers approaching through the fog, so he shot and killed them too. [...] One of them was Tatsuguchi. [...] Laird said that he found Tatsuguchi's diary and an address book in which he was shocked to see American names and addresses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 the Kuomintang-warlord {{alliance}} in Guangzhou was ruptured, and Sun fled to Shanghai. By <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{the need to}} seek Soviet support for his cause. In 1923 a joint statement by Sun and a Soviet representative in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance for China's national unification. Soviet advisers—the most prominent of whom was {{an agent of the}} Comintern, Mikhail Borodin—began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the Kuomintang {{along the lines of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union and establish the First United Front. The CCP was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the Kuomintang, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their party identities to form a [...] "bloc within." ...|$|E
2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E

2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} {{the specificity of}} [...] with a parable. A king married a wife and did not give her a legal marriage contract. He then sent her away without giving her a bill of divorce. He did the same to a second wife and a third, giving them neither a marriage contract nor a bill of divorce. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a poor, well-born orphan girl whom he desired to marry. He told his best man (shoshbin) not {{to deal with her}} as with the previous ones, as she was well-born, modest in her actions and worthy. The king directed that his aide draw up a marriage contract for her, stating the period of seven years, the year, the month, the day of the month, and the region, {{in the same way that}} [...] writes about Esther, [...] "So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign." [...] So God did not state when God created the generation of the Flood and did not state when God removed them from the world, except insofar as [...] reports, [...] "on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up." [...] The same fate befell the generation of the Dispersal after the Tower of Babel and the generation of Egypt; Scripture does not indicate when God created then or when they passed away. But when Israel appeared, God told Moses that God would not act towards them as God did towards those earlier generations, as they were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God instructed that Moses record for them the precise month, day of the month, year, region, and city in which God lifted them up. Therefore, [...] says: [...] "And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai," [...] indicating the region; [...] "in the tent of meeting," [...] indicating the province; [...] "in the second year," [...] indicating the precise year; [...] "in the second month," [...] indicating the precise month; [...] "on the first day of the month," [...] indicating the precise day of the month; and [...] "after they were come out of Egypt," [...] indicating the era.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
