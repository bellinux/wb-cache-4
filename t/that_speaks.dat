5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{auditory}} behavior in Pitch(PPS) and Duration(DPS) Pattern Sequence tests and in the Dichotic Listening (Dichotic Digits Test/DDT) of familiar and unfamiliar words (Staggered Spondaic Words/SSW) in Japanese descendants <b>that</b> <b>speak</b> Japanese and Japanese descendants <b>that</b> do not <b>speak</b> Japanese, and to compare these findings with a group of non-Japanese descendants who have no contact with the Japanese language. Method: 60 High School graduates aged 17 to 40 years were evaluated. Subjects were divided into three groups: GJJ, Japanese descendants <b>that</b> <b>speak</b> Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese; GJP, Japanese descendants <b>that</b> <b>speak</b> Portuguese and do not speak Japanese; GBP non-oriental descendants <b>that</b> <b>speak</b> Brazilian Portuguese.

25|$|Frederick Busch {{asserts that}} Mailer {{has created a}} voice <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> about Sam, and it might also {{represent}} Mailer in some ways. The problem, states Busch, is Mailer wants to speak about his own difficulties writing, but needs to objectify his voice {{in order to create}} fiction and not autobiography. Thus, he not only analyzes the characters' feelings, but also his own.|$|E

However, the most distinctive local features have gradually diminished among younger speakers in favor of Midland American. There is also some influence from the Southern American dialect found in Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{holds that}} Orthodoxy has {{deviated}} from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law. Conservative rabbis make {{a conscious effort}} to use historical sources to determine what kind of changes occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that can better understand a proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today. Like Orthodoxy, there is no one legal body <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> for all Jews in their religious community.|$|E
25|$|Typical NBCAM events include fundraising-based foot races, walk-a-thons, and bicycle rides.

25|$|Self-categorization {{theory is}} a social {{psychological}} theory that describes {{the circumstances under which}} a person will perceive collections of people (including themselves) as a group, as well as the consequences of perceiving people in group terms. Although the theory is often introduced as an explanation of psychological group formation (which was one of its early goals), it is more accurately thought of as general analysis of the functioning of categorization processes in social perception and interaction <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> to issues of individual identity as much as group phenomena.|$|E

25|$|A theory <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> to {{the origin}} of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an {{information}} system in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum entropy variations with abundant free energy, suggest the pore space in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.|$|E
25|$|Berber, however, {{no longer}} is widely spoken in present-day Tunisia; e.g., centuries ago many of its Zenata Berbers became Arabized. Today in Tunisia the small {{minority}} <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> Berber may be heard on Jerba island, around the salt lakes region, and near the desert, {{as well as a}}long the mountainous border with Algeria (across this frontier to the west lies a large region where the Zenati Berber languages and dialects predominate). In contrast, use of Berber is relatively common in Morocco, and also in Algeria, and in the remote central Sahara. Berber poetry endures, as well as a traditional Berber literature.|$|E
25|$|During the Mexican Revolution, Álvaro Obregón {{invited a}} group of Canadian German-speaking Mennonites to resettle in Mexico. By the late 1920s, some 7,000 had immigrated to Chihuahua State and Durango State, almost all from Canada, only a few from the U.S. and Russia. Today, Mexico {{accounts}} for about 42% of all Mennonites in Latin America. Mennonites in the country stand out because of their fair skin, hair, and eyes. They are a largely insular community <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> a form of German and wear traditional clothing. They own their own businesses in various communities in Chihuahua, and account for {{about half of the}} state's farm economy, excelling in cheese production.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{has been}} {{creating}} complicated abstract paintings and litographs since the 1970s. She employs {{a wide variety}} of media, working in painting, printmaking and richly textured mixed media pieces. Such images and collage elements as commercial slogans, sign-like petroglyphs, rough drawing, and the inclusion and layering of text are unusually intersected into a complex vision created out of the artist’s personal experience. Her works contain strong, insistent socio-political commentary <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> to past and present cultural appropriation and abuse, while identifying the continued significance of the Native American peoples. She addresses today’s tribal politics, human rights and environmental issues with humor. Smith is known internationally for her philosophically centered work regarding her strong traditional beliefs and political activism.|$|E
25|$|If Not Now, When ? is {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he poses the question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that privilege is the ticket to happiness.|$|E
25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. People either loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha was a genius at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> for itself. Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He was an absolute genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books far more often had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E
