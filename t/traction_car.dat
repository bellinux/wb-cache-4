5000|$|The first {{electric}} streetcar open to {{passengers in}} New York City, a Julien electric <b>traction</b> <b>car,</b> was run on September 17, 1888 {{on the line}} to 86th Street.

50|$|The New York and Harlem Railroad (now the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line) {{was one of}} {{the first}} railroads in the United States, and was the world's first street railway. Designed by John Stephenson, it was opened in stages between 1832 and 1852 between Lower Manhattan to and beyond Harlem. Initially using horses, the line was {{partially}} converted to use steam engines and then electricity, using a battery-powered Julien electric <b>traction</b> <b>car.</b> In 1907 the then leaseholders of line, New York City Railway went into receivership. Following a further receivership in 1932 the New York Railways Corporation converted the line to bus operation. The Murray Hill Tunnel now carries a lane of road traffic, but not the buses.|$|E

5000|$|Before cars {{or other}} ways of {{transportation}} were invented, horse-drawn trolleys were {{the only means of}} transportation in South Side. After the horse-drawn trolleys, then came the cable <b>traction</b> <b>cars,</b> and then finally the electric trolley. Horse cars operated in South Side until 1923. In 1915, the horse-drawn trolleys and the electric trolley met at the corner of Eighteenth and Sarah Streets. The electric cars turned into what were called street cars. They were the most common means of travel around Pittsburgh and South Side, until the first incline was opened. In 1877, The Duquesne Incline opened and ran from West Carson Street to Mount Washington. In 1870, the Monongahela Incline was built and it connected West Carson Street with Grandview Avenue. The Duquesne and Monongahela inclines are still in operation today. Some inclines that are not in operation today are: The Castle Shannon Incline No.1, The Knoxville Incline, The Mount Oliver Incline, and The St. Clair Incline.

Today Frank I. HARDY, superintendent of transportation of the traction company, stated that disregard of orders caused the wreck and that B. T. CORKWELL, motorman of the southbound train, probably is the one to blame. The disaster, rated as the worst in all interurban history, occurred at a sharp curve, near Kingsland, six miles from Bluffton. The line is operated under a block system and until the railway makes public the orders issued the crews, {{it will not be}} definitely known which motorman was negligent." ...|$|R

50|$|A {{trailing}} car intentionally bumps the car {{in front}} of it. The bump sometimes causes the lead car's rear tires to momentarily lose traction.

The trailing driver positions to pass the leading car before the next corner. Bump and run is often done after coming off a corner. It is much more dangerous when done in the middle of a corner because both cars are already loose.|$|R
