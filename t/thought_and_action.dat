The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale mobilization.|$|E

25|$|In social psychology, {{attitudes are}} defined as learned, global {{evaluations}} of a person, object, place, or issue that influence <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action.</b> Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes. Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} a habit of literate {{cultures}} to view oral cultures simply {{in terms of their}} lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written literature. While literacy extends human possibilities in both <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.|$|E
25|$|Sravana {{literally}} means hearing, and broadly {{refers to}} perception and observations typically {{aided by a}} counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. Manana refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on svadhyaya and sravana. Nididhyāsana refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state {{where there is a}} fusion of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as sadhana practice that unifies Yoga and Karma ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.|$|E
25|$|Though his {{ministry}} covered {{the period of}} greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity. His sermons covered a wide scope of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action,</b> and he showed the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil War, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show his warm sympathy with {{the cause of the}} slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members.|$|E

40|$|This chapter reviews {{research}} {{on the role of}} anger in conflict and negotiation. I focus on three broad classes of dependent variables that I roughly call feelings, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> to refer to (1) affective states and interpersonal sentiments, (2) conscious <b>thought</b> processes, <b>and</b> (3) actual conflict behavior. In addition, I distinguish between intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of anger, with intrapersonal effects referring to the influence of an individual’s anger on his or her own feelings, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> interpersonal effects referring to the influence of one individual’s anger on the feelings, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> of one or more other conflict parties. The review reveals that at the intrapersonal level, anger is associated with hostile feelings, biased perceptions and attributions, and competitive behavior. At the interpersonal level, anger sometimes elicits reciprocal hostility that motivates competition and sometimes strategic considerations that motivate cooperation. Recent studies that incorporated several moderators to reconcile these disparate sets of findings are discussed...|$|R
500|$|Flanders, {{although}} {{himself a}} conservative, espoused a constructive competition between conservatism and liberalism. He felt that liberalism represented {{the welfare of}} individual people, as opposed to organizations—governments, businesses, etc.—preserving freedom of <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> <b>action.</b> For him, conservatism was concerned with preserving institutions that {{serve the interests of}} people, collectively. Conservatives, according to Flanders, could find themselves offering [...] "reasoned objections to foolish proposals" [...] by emotionally motivated liberals. [...] He observed that, “Even in the established democracies,... the voters are easily seduced into leaving politics to skillful politicians who are themselves without a sense of general, social responsibility.” ...|$|E

Sullivan's voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the [...] "equality" [...] plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph. Another popular number is Sir Joseph's song [...] "When I was a Lad", recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of W. H. Smith, the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877.|$|E

[...] For example, one may claim to be a reincarnation of Plato, therefore having the same soul. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.|$|R
