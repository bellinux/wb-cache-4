25|$|To {{develop a}} Bayesian network, we often first develop a DAG G such <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> X {{satisfies}} the local Markov property {{with respect to}} G. Sometimes this is done by creating a causal DAG. We then ascertain the conditional probability distributions of each variable given its parents in G. In many cases, in particular in the case where the variables are discrete, if we define the joint distribution of X to be the product of these conditional distributions, then X is a Bayesian network with respect to G.|$|E

500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Time {{is not an}} {{innocuous}} entity. Here in Sonnet 65 Shakespeare shows time's cruel ravages on all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> is enduring.

He also explains that [...] "Sonnet 65 makes use of the same words [...] and more or less specific notions, but it proceeds and culminates far more impressively," [...] in comparison to Sonnet 64.

2500|$|Kant {{argued that}} the {{structures}} of logic which organize, interpret and abstract observations were built into the human mind and were true and valid a priori. Mill, on the contrary, said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> them to be true because we have enough individual instances of their truth to generalize: in his words, [...] "From instances we have observed, we feel warranted in concluding that what we found true in those instances holds in all similar ones, past, present and future, however numerous they may be". Although the psychological or epistemological specifics given by Mill through which we build our logical apparatus may not be completely warranted, his explanation still nonetheless manages to demonstrate {{that there is no}} way around Kant's a priori logic. To recant Mill's original idea in an empiricist twist: [...] "Indeed, the very principles of logical deduction are true because we observe that using them leads to true conclusions", which is itself an a priori presupposition.|$|E
