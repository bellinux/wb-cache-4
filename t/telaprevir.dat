40|$|Background & Aims: Recurrence of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection after orthotopical liver transplantation (OLT) is common and associated with reduced graft and patient survival.

Aim {{of the present study}} was to analyse <b>telaprevir</b> plasma concentrations in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection after OLT in comparison to patients without OLT and IS. Methods: Five patients with HCV genotype 1 infection after OLT and 37 HCV genotype 1 -infected patients patients without prior OLT were treated with <b>telaprevir</b> 2250 mg daily, ribavirin 1000 / 1200 mg daily and pegylated interferon-alfa- 2 a 180 g once weekly (triple therapy). <b>Telaprevir</b> plasma c oncentrations were analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.

40|$|Variants {{resistant}} to compounds specifically targeting HCV are observed in clinical trials. A multi-variant viral dynamic model {{was developed to}} quantify the evolution and in vivo fitness of variants in subjects dosed with monotherapy of an HCV protease inhibitor, <b>telaprevir.</b> Variant fitness was estimated using a model in which variants were selected by competition for shared limited replication space. Fitness was represented {{in the absence of}} <b>telaprevir</b> by different variant production rate constants and in the presence of <b>telaprevir</b> by additional antiviral blockage by <b>telaprevir.</b> Model parameters, including rate constants for viral production, clearance, and effective <b>telaprevir</b> concentration, were estimated from 1) plasma HCV RNA levels of subjects before, during, and after dosing, 2) post-dosing prevalence of plasma variants from subjects, and 3) sensitivity of variants to <b>telaprevir</b> in the HCV replicon.

40|$|<b>Telaprevir</b> (VX- 950) is an orally active, {{specifically}} targeted antiviral {{therapy for}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{that has been}} shown to profoundly reduce plasma HCV RNA in genotype 1 patients. Using a highly sensitive sequencing assay that detects minor populations of viral variants (> 5 %), mutations were identified that conferred low-level (V 36 M/A, T 54 A, or R 155 K/T) or high-level (A 156 V/T and 36 / 155) resistance to <b>telaprevir</b> in vitro. We report a detailed kinetic analysis of these variants in 16 patients given <b>telaprevir</b> or <b>telaprevir</b> pegylated interferon–alpha- 2 a (PEG-IFN–alpha- 2 a) for 14 days. In 4 patients who had a viral rebound on <b>telaprevir</b> alone, the R 155 K/T and A 156 V/T variants were detected during the initial steep decline in HCV RNA. During the rebound phase, the R 155 K/T and A 156 V/T variants were replaced by V 36 (M/A) /R 155 (K/T) double mutant variants.

The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of <b>telaprevir</b> twice daily versus every 8 hours in producing a sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR 12) (based on a - 11 % lower limit of the 95 % lower confidence interval for the difference between groups). Results At baseline, of 740 patients, 85 % had levels of HCV RNA ≥ 800, 000 IU/mL, 28 % had fibrosis (F 3 -F 4), 14 % had cirrhosis (F 4), 57 % were infected with HCV genotype 1 a, and 71 % had the non-CC IL 28 B genotype. Of patients who were treated with <b>telaprevir</b> twice daily, 74. 3 % achieved SVR 12 compared with 72. 8 % of patients who were treated with <b>telaprevir</b> every 8 hours (difference in response, 1. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval, - 4. 9 % to 12. 0 %), so <b>telaprevir</b> twice daily is noninferior to <b>telaprevir</b> every 8 hours. All subgroups of patients who were treated with <b>telaprevir</b> twice daily versus those who were treated every 8 hours had similar rates of SVR 12. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in the <b>telaprevir</b> phase were fatigue (47 %), pruritus (43 %), anemia (42 %), nausea (37 %), rash (35 %), and headache (26 %); serious AEs were reported in 9 % of patients.

Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in those with baseline eGFR < 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 compared to the group with baseline eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (12 vs. 18 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P = 0. 047). Serum creatinine fully normalized by twelve weeks after cessation of <b>telaprevir</b> in 83 % of patients, however experiencing a significant creatinine rise during <b>telaprevir</b> use {{was associated with a}} 6. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate at twelve months in an adjusted model. Decline in kidney function during therapy with <b>telaprevir</b> is common and is not associated with baseline eGFR < 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 as previously reported...|$|E

Approved in 2011 as standard-of-care for the treatment of patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1, <b>telaprevir</b> represents a major therapeutic advance. Used in combination with PEGylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin, telaprevir-based regimens cured &gt; 75 % of treatment-na&iuml;ve patients in the Phase III registration studies. <b>Telaprevir</b> is also effective for patients who have previously failed interferon-based therapy. <b>Telaprevir</b> presents a number of new challenges for clinicians, including a more demanding dosing schedule, telaprevir-specific adverse events, potential for drug&ndash;drug interactions, and selection of drug-resistant HCV variants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Neopterin is {{a marker}} of monocyte/macrophage activity. Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) is {{a marker of}} {{hepatocyte}} injury. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine changes in neopterin and ALAT levels, as markers of inflammation, in two ancillary studies during two-phase 1 b trials of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS 3. 4 A protease inhibitor <b>telaprevir</b> (VX- 950), with or without peginterferon alfa- 2 a (Peg-IFN). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four chronic hepatitis C patients (genotype 1) received placebo or <b>telaprevir,</b> with or without Peg-IFN, for 14 days in two multiple-dose studies. RESULTS: During administration of <b>telaprevir,</b> every patient demonstrated a > 2 -log decrease in HCV RNA. Mean neopterin and ALAT levels decreased in all four groups receiving <b>telaprevir</b> alone. In contrast, mean neopterin levels increased and ALAT levels decreased in the Peg-IFN plus <b>telaprevir</b> and Peg-IFN plus placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with an HCV NS 3. 4 A protease inhibitor ameliorates inflammation. The increase in neopterin levels and the decrease in ALAT levels during administration of Peg-IFN with or without <b>telaprevir</b> are in accordance with earlier observations showing that IFN reduces hepatocyte injury but increases monocyte/macrophage activity. The IFN-mediated immunomodulatory effects appear to remain intact when IFN is combined with telaprevi...|$|E
40|$|Background Anemia is more {{frequent}} in patients receiving <b>telaprevir</b> with PEGylated interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) {{than in those}} receiving PEG-IFN/RBV alone. Objectives The objective was to measure the impact of <b>telaprevir</b> on RBV bioavailability and to assess the concomitant renal function. Materials and Methods Thirty-seven hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients non-responders to a previous course of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy and re-treated with triple therapy combining PEG-IFN/RBV and <b>telaprevir</b> were analyzed. RBV bioavailability was measured before the triple therapy initiation, during <b>telaprevir</b> treatment at week (W) 4 and W 8, and after <b>telaprevir</b> cessation (post W 16). The renal function was assessed by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Results At W 4, RBV bioavailability, expressed as mg/L/daily dose/kg body weight, was significantly increased (median increase = 0. 06 mg/L/dose/kg; P < 0. 001). In parallel, the renal function was impaired with a mean eGFR decrease of - 6. 8 mL/minutes/ 1. 73 m² (P = 0. 109). Between W 4 and W 8, RBV bioavailability continued to increase (P < 0. 001) but subsequently decreased slightly after <b>telaprevir</b> discontinuation with a concomitant restoration of the renal function (eGFR increase of 6. 34 mL/minutes/ 1. 73 m²). Conclusions Our results indicated a reversible increase in RBV bioavailability after <b>telaprevir</b> exposure, which might {{be linked to the}} impairment of the GFR. This also suggests a RBV-telaprevir pharmacological interaction, a possible source of severe anemia observed under triple therapy. These results suggest that RBV pharmacological monitoring may be clinically relevant, especially in the context of first-generation HCV protease inhibitor-based therapy...|$|E
