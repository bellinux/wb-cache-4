5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access to Hitler, this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise {{the inner workings of the}} Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E

Since 2012, the entrance ticket included the use of most of the attractions.|$|R

5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and to make certain <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government {{did not need to}} engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} the Witham had {{deteriorated}} by 1802, and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice. He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed, and the associated staunch {{was in danger of}} collapse. He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere, and also suggested <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Boston should be through the Witham Naviagable Drains, rather than the Grand Sluice, or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice, to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour. In 1803, he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt. Four years later, he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings should be removed, and replaced by one near Washingborough church. The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808, and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work, to be carried out by a company of proprietors. They could borrow £30,000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £70,000 for the navigation element. Two new locks were built, one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney, which replaced the original locks. A new channel was cut near Fiskerton, upstream of Bardney, and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was dropped. While Stamp End lock was being rebuilt, an alternative route was provided, utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph. Rennie recorded that Branston Delph, Carlton Dike, Nocton Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time. The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that for ACS patients, weekend {{admission}} is associated with higher mortality and lower utilization of invasive cardiac procedures, {{and those who did}} undergo these interventions had higher rates of mortality and complications than their weekday counterparts. This data leads to the possible conclusion <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> diagnostic/interventional procedures may be contingent upon the day of admission, which may impact mortality. This phenomenon is described as weekend effect.|$|E

The policy outlines {{the roles of the}} various stakeholders - households, municipalities, provincial governments, various branches of national government - and establishes coordination and monitoring mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey 60% of the {{population}} had access to an improved water source, broken down by 73% in urban areas and 57% in rural areas.

The court also held Betamax was not a staple article because its main purpose was copying. It went on to suggest damages, injunctive relief, and compulsory licenses in lieu of other relief.|$|E
25|$|Without {{access to}} {{appropriate}} antibiotics (principally ceftazidime or meropenem), the septicemic form of melioidosis exceeds 90% in mortality rate. With appropriate antibiotics, {{the mortality rate}} is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with bacteraemia or severe sepsis. It seems certain <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow, with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5 to 9 days.|$|E

25|$|Both SAAU and HFAU contain similar {{volumes of}} {{hydrocarbon}} with similar risks, but {{the risks associated}} with each acid are quite different. HF requires much stricter precautions because of its greater potential for harm (this is due to its lower boiling point and higher harmful potential). In light of this high risk, the American Petroleum Institute has issued a Recommended Practice specifically for HF alkylation units (API RP 751). This publication recommends <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> an HF alkylation unit be strictly limited due to the potential hazards of HF. No similar, specific safety document is required for sulfuric acid alkylation.|$|E
25|$|The Super Bowl was {{considered}} a level one national security event. To that end, the New Jersey State Police and the NFL host committee installed a 2.5-mile chain-link perimeter fence around the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which {{is located at the}} intersection of a number of highways. Security planners stated <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the area would be strictly limited and regulated. To that end, parking spaces were greatly reduced, tailgate parties restricted and walking to the venue strictly prohibited. Taxis and limousines were not permitted to drop off passengers. Passengers for trains to the stadium were limited in what they carry and were screened before boarding.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Avignon Papacy the {{fortress}} saw much activity with high ranking church officials, princes and notables crossing the bridge. Between 1320 and 1350 several cardinals built palaces in Villeneuve, across the bridge from the papal palace in Avignon. On a number of occasions sections of the bridge were destroyed when the Rhône flooded. The bridge then became impassable and the river had to be crossed by ferry. The harbour on the right bank was {{at the base of the}} tower. Eighteenth century drawings show <b>that</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> both the fortress and the harbour was controlled by gates on the path leading up from the river bank along what is now the Montée de la Tour.|$|E
