A single tool will {{sometimes}} handle both jobs, and is usually suitable for light-duty bicycle shop use. A separate <b>tap</b> <b>set</b> and facing set is usually employed by frame builders where more robust tooling that is more frequently used is needed. Both tap sets and facing sets are intended for frame finishing work after welding and/or brazing, as the frame tubes tend to deform slightly after this process, and for cleaning out any weld splatter or paint from the bottom bracket threads.

Optimization of Fuel cost and Active power loss by adjusting the control variables such as generator voltage, transformer <b>tap</b> <b>setting</b> and other sources of reactive power such as shunt capacitor banks. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested on IEEE 14 bus system and their performances are compared with the results.
