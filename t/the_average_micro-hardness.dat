40|$|Q 235 steel was firstly {{treated by}} W-Mo-Y Multi-elements co-diffusion {{followed}} by plasma nitriding process. And then the wear tests were conducted. The effects of technological parameters on alloying layer were studied.

Results show that the microstructure of W-Mo-Y Co-diffusion layer is columnar crystal; W, Mo contents decrease from the outside to the inside.

A molybdenized layer was successfully formed on Ti 6 Al 4 V by the DPSA treatments. The microstructure, composition distribution, phase structure and hardness were analyzed by SEM/EDS, XRD and vickers micro-hardness tester. The molybdenized layer was composed of Mo-deposited layer and Mo-diffusing layer. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> surface <b>micro-hardness</b> of <b>the</b> surface modified layer was 1170. 8 HV 0. 1, which was much {{higher than that of}} the Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE An inhomogeneous {{irradiance}} distribution from a light-curing unit (LCU) can locally cause inhomogeneous curing with locally inadequately cured and/or over-cured areas causing e. g. monomer elution or internal shrinkage stresses, {{and thus}} reduce {{the lifetime of}} dental resin based composite (RBC) restorations. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine both the irradiance distribution of two light curing units (LCUs) and its influence on the local mechanical properties of a RBC.

40|$|With {{composite}} powders of Al and TiO 2 {{systems as}} reactants, Al 2 O 3 reinforced Ti-Al matrix intermetallic composite coatings were prepared on the TC 4 alloy substrate by laser in-situ synthesis processing. The effects of laser power, laser scanning speed and laser spot size on laser energy density were analyzed, respectively. The macroscopic morphology, cross-section microstructure, and micro-hardness of Al 2 O 3 /Ti-Al composite coatings {{were characterized by}} optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) and micro-hardness tester. The results show that scanning speed has {{the greatest impact on}} laser energy density firstly, then the laser spot size, and then the weakest is laser power. With the scanning speed increases, Al 2 O 3 /Ti-Al composite coatings surface become rougher, fish-scale shape morphology are more obvious, and the thickness of bonding-zone decreases. The reinforced phase of composite coating is composed of k-Al 2 O 3 and α-Al 2 O 3, while the matrix phase is composed of α-Ti and α 2 -Ti 3 Al. And with the increase of laser scanning speed, k-Al 2 O 3 changes into α-Al 2 O 3 partially. The morphology of Al 2 O 3 reinforcement tends to change from dendrite shape to fiber. The micro-hardness of samples has a smooth transition tendency from the substrate to the coating surface.

40|$|Aluminum is {{extensively}} {{utilized in}} industry {{due to its}} light weight, excellent workability and low cost. However, its wear resistance, hardness and mechanical properties are poor in comparison to steel. The technique of laser surface alloying was used to improve the aluminum surface properties such as hardness by modifying the composition and microstructure of the surface. A continuous wave (CW) CO 2 laser beam was utilized for surface alloying in this research. The {{maximum output power of}} the CO 2 laser is 27 W. The alloyed materials comprised of micro-powder of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni). Pure aluminum substrate was pre-coated by a mixture of nickel and iron micro-powder with a ratio of 2 : 1. Hence, CO 2 laser beam was irradiated on the pre-placed Fe-Ni powder to melt them together with the substrate at various times of exposure (10 - 60 s). The distance from output laser beam into the specimen was 20 cm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed to analyze the alloying elements and study the microstructure of aluminum surface respectively. The hardness of alloyed surface was measured by using Vickers hardness tester. SEM analysis showed that the alloyed layer produced by a mixture of different elements is more homogenous and re-solidified. XRD results confirmed that several new intermetallic compounds such as Al 5 Fe 2, Al 6 Fe, AlFe 3, AlNi 3 Al 5 FeNi, Al 09 Nii. i and Al 76. 8 Fe 14 are formed. The existence of these compounds confirmed that the aluminum surface has been alloyed.

Two {{kinds of}} mixed powders:Ti- 6 Al- 4 V/B/C and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V/B 4 C which are pre-pasted or {{synchronized}} fed on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrates separately were scanned by a 500 W pulsed YAG laser to induce in situ formation of titanium composite coatings contained TiBx and TiC ceramic reinforced phases. The influences of laser processing parameters including Pulse Frequency (PF), Pulse Width (PW), Laser Power (P) and Scanning Speed (V) {{together with the}} powder proportions on the microstructure and properties of the coatings were investigated. Microstructures, phase components of the coating were analyzed by OM, SEM, TEM and XRD respectively. Experimental results show that two and more kinds of ceramic reinforcements were in situ formatted in the matrix of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. TiB and TiC ceramics were formed evenly with the morphology of needle, tiny dendrites and disperse particles in the prepasted single path specimens. For the powder feed laser cladding layers, the ceramic reinforcements were TiB (needlelike), TiB 2 (hexagonal prism or rodlike), {{a small amount of}} TiC (disperse particles) and non fully reacted B 4 C. The microhardness increased with the increase of the amount of B 4 C and B+C additions. When the added B and C contents are the same, the microhardness of the coating with B 4 C addition is higher than that of the coating with B+C addition. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>micro-hardness</b> of a powder prepasted (with 20 wt. % B 4 C addition) multi-path laser cladding layer formed under the optimized processing parameters is up to 800 HV, which is more than 2 times of that of the substrate (340 Hv), and the wear weight loss of the layer decreased nearly 3 times that of the substrate...|$|E

Results The irradiance distribution affected the hardness distribution {{across the surface of the}} specimens. The hardness distribution corresponded well to the inhomogeneous irradiance distributions of the LCU. The highest reaction rates occurred after approximately 2 s light exposure. A DC of 40 % was reached after 3. 6 or 5. 7 s, depending on the LCU. The inhomogeneous hardness distribution was still evident after 80 s of light exposure. Significance The irradiance distribution from a LCU is reflected in the hardness distribution across the surface. Irradiance level of the LCU and light exposure time do not affect the pattern of the hardness distribution - only the hardness level. In areas of low irradiation this may result in inadequate resin polymerization, poor physical properties, and hence premature failure of the restorations as they are usually much smaller than the investigated specimens. It has to be stressed that inhomogeneous does not necessarily mean poor if in all areas of the restoration enough light intensity is introduced to achieve a high degree of cure. 17081 X 10, Bundesministerium für Bildung und ForschungFederal Republic of Germany, Ministry of Education and Research [17081 X 10]; Operational Program Research and Development for Innovations; Czech Republic, within the framework of project Centre of Polymer Systems [CZ. 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 03. 0111]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); VOCO Gmb...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} paper is to optimize technological parameters of hardening high-energy processing used for sprayed coatings made of materials based on oxide ceramics with inclusions of solid lubricant. The paper presents results of the investigations on influence of power density and total number of laser irradiation impulses in a spot treatment on thickness of treated coating layers made of materials based on oxide ceramics. The considered wear-resistant coatings require increased cohesive and adhesive strength. Therefore, {{the total number of}} impulses should ensure melting and sealing of the coatings along the whole thickness that will fully contribute to obtain hardened nano-crystalline and amorphous structures. The work is based on complex metallography, X-ray diffraction and electron-microscopic investigations on modified structural elements of composite coatings being treated with highly concentrated energy sources. The following main processes of hardened plasma coating formations have been revealed in the paper: com paction of sprayed materials due to thermal and shock-wave impacts of laser irradiation impulses. In this case material porosity is decreasing, cohesive and adhesive strength of coatings is increasing, grain structure is crushed, amorphous and nano-crystalline phases of higher strength are formed all these facts are evidenced by an increase in <b>average</b> <b>micro-hardness</b> of deposited compositions. Duration of thermal laser irradiation impulse impact on the material is sufficient to activate chemical processes in the boundaries of main phases of the composite coating. This leads to formation of finely dispersed (including nanoparticle size) compounds that strengthen boundaries of the main phases and the coating as a whole.

40|$|Sharp {{leading edges}} and nose caps on {{hypersonic}} vehicles, re-entry vehicles and reusable launch vehicles are items of current research interest for enhanced aerodynamic performance and maneuverability. The unique combination of mechanical properties, physical properties, thermal / electrical conductivities and thermal shock resistance of ZrB 2 {{make it a}} promising candidate material for such applications. In the recent past, {{a lot of work}} has been carried out on ZrB 2 -based materials towards processing as well as characterization of their mechanical, oxidation and thermal behaviour. ZrB 2 based materials have been successfully processed by conventional hot pressing, pressureless sintering, reactive hot pressing and spark plasma sintering. Densification of ZrB 2 gets activated when the oxide impurities (B 2 O 3 and ZrO 2) were removed from particle surfaces, which minimized coarsening. B 4 C is widely used as a sintering additive for ZrB 2 because it reduces ZrO 2 at low temperature. It is found that full densification in ZrB 2 based materials by hot pressing is achieved either at 2000 C and higher temperatures with moderate pressure of 20 - 30 MPa or at reduced temperature (1790 - 1840 C) with much higher pressure (800 - 1500 MPa). But no study is available that identifies the dominant hot pressing mechanism at different temperatures and pressures. On the other hand, reinforcement of SiC in ZrB 2 is known to increase flexural strength, fracture toughness and oxidation resistance. It has been shown that oxidation resistance of ZrB 2 -SiC composites is superior to that of monolithic ZrB 2 and SiC. For high temperature applications in air, the residual strength (room temperature strength after exposure in air at high temperatures) of non oxide ceramics after oxidation is important. A few reports are available on residual strength of ZrB 2 –SiC composite after thermal exposure at high temperatures. In contrast to the literature on composites, there are no reports available on the residual strength of monolithic ZrB 2 after exposure to high temperatures. Also, previous studies on residual strength of ZrB 2 -SiC composites have been limited to a single temperature of exposure. But {{there is a need to}} measure the residual strength after exposure to a range of temperatures since the oxide layer structure changes with temperature. The room temperature thermal conductivity data for ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composite shows a wide scatter in value as well as a dependence on microstructural parameters, especially porosity and grain size. Also, there is insufficient data available for the high temperature thermal conductivity of ZrB 2 -SiC. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of SiC content on thermal conductivity of ZrB 2 -SiC composites at high temperatures. The present thesis seeks to address some of these gaps to better understand the suitability of ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composites for ultra-high temperature applications. In the present work, hot pressing is used for densification of ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composites. Different amounts of B 4 C (0, 0. 5, 1, 3 & 5 wt %) were used as sintering additives in ZrB 2 and hot pressed at 2000 C with 25 MPa applied pressure. The hot pressed samples are characterized for their microstructural, mechanical properties and oxidation behaviour. By addition of B 4 C, density as well as micro-hardness increased. For lower B 4 C content (0. 5 & 1 wt %), hot pressed ZrB 2 has shown considerable improvement in flexural strength after exposure in air at 1000 C for 5 hours, while higher B 4 C content (3 & 5 wt %) leads to marginal or no improvement. Due to the better mechanical and oxidation behavior of composites containing SiC, the densification behavior during hot pressing was studied. The densification behaviors as well as the microstructures for hot pressing of ZrB 2 - 20 % SiC composite were found to change in a very 0 narrow temperature range. During hot pressing at 1700 C, the densification was found to be mechanically driven particle fragmentation and rearrangement. On the other hand, thermally activated mass transport mechanisms started dominating after initial particle fragmentation and rearrangement after hot pressing at 1850 C and 2000 C. At 2000 C, the rate of grain boundary diffusion was enhanced which resulted into annihilation of dislocation. The effect of SiC contents (10, 20 & 30 vol %) on mechanical and oxidation behavior of ZrB 2 -SiC composite were also studied. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>micro-hardness</b> and fracture toughness of ZrB 2 -SiC composites increased with SiC content. But the flexural strength of ZrB 2 - 20 vol % SiC composites was found to be the highest. Oxidation and residual strength of hot pressed ZrB 2 -SiC composites were evaluated as a function of SiC contents after exposure over a wide temperature range (1000 - 1700 C). Multilayer oxide scale structures were found after oxidation. The composition and thickness of these multilayered oxide scale structures were found to depend on exposure temperature and SiC content. After exposure to 1000 C for 5 hours, the residual strength of ZrB 2 -SiC composites improved by nearly 60 % compared to the as-hot pressed composites with 20 & 30 vol % SiC. On the other hand, the residual strength of these composites remained unchanged after 1500 C for 5 hours. A drastic degradation in residual strength was observed in composites with 20 & 30 vol % SiC whereas strength was retained for ZrB 2 - 10 % SiC composite after exposure to 1700 C for 5 hours in ZrB 2 –SiC. Therefore, residual strength of ZrB 2 - 10 % SiC composite was measured at different exposure times (up to 10 hours) at 1500 0 C. An attempt was made to correlate the microstructural changes and oxide scales with residual strength with respect to variation in SiC content and temperature of exposure. Since the ZrB 2 - 20 vol % SiC composite showed the maximum strength, the dependence of strength on various microstructural as well processing parameters was also studied. It was found that porosity, grain size as well as surface residual stress due to grinding influenced the strength of ZrB 2 - 20 vol % SiC composites. Finally, thermal diffusivity and conductivity of hot pressed ZrB 2 with different amounts of B 4 C and ZrB 2 -SiC composites were investigated experimentally over a wide temperature range (25 – 1500 C). Both thermal diffusivity as well as thermal conductivity was found to decrease with increase in temperature for all hot pressed ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composites. At around 200 C, thermal conductivity of ZrB 2 -SiC composites was found to be composition independent. Thermal conductivity of ZrB 2 -SiC composites was also correlated with theoretical predictions of the Maxwell-Eucken relation. The dominated mechanisms of heat transport for all hot pressed ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composites at room temperature were determined by Wiedemann-Franz analysis using measured room temperature electrical conductivity of these materials. It was found that the electronic thermal conductivity dominated for all monolithic ZrB 2 whereas the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity increased with SiC contents for ZrB 2 -SiC composites. The heat conduction mechanism at high temperature was also studied by measuring the high temperature electrical conductivity of ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 -SiC composites. The effect of porosity on thermal diffusivity and conductivity was also studied for ZrB 2 - 20 vol % SiC composites...|$|E
