5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane {{highways}} through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by rocket-propelled grenades within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Local banks had been closed {{for some time and}} the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> they needed.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> they needed.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E

Further, her {{cargo carrying capacity}} was {{two or three times}} as much as these sailing ships.|$|E

25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E
25|$|Back home, Selena learns {{from her}} father that Yolanda has been {{stealing}} money from the fan club. On March 9, 1995, Selena and her father, along with Suzette, confront Yolanda about the missing funds at a meeting. Yolanda denies this and says she would never <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> from Selena. Selena, angry and hurt by the betrayal, asks Yolanda how she could do this to her, and to her fans. Yolanda pleads for time to return the boutique's financial records and claims she can prove that she has done nothing wrong. Selena and Chris discuss the prospect of starting their family when the crossover tour is finished. The future seems bright with promise.|$|E
25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> of animal origin be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E

25|$|Each one has {{at least}} ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well-trained that they follow them {{wherever}} {{they want to take}} them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> they can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|However, between 1770 and 1774, Fox's {{seemingly}} promising {{career in}} the political establishment was spoiled. In February 1770, Fox {{was appointed to the}} board of the Admiralty by Lord North, but on the 15th of the same month he resigned due to his enthusiastic opposition to the government's Royal Marriages Act, the provisions of which – incidentally – cast doubt on the legitimacy of his parents' marriage. On 28 December 1772, North appointed Fox to the board of the Treasury and again he surrendered his post, in February 1774, over the Government's allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates. Behind these incidents lay his family's resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom. But the fact that such a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court. George III, also observing Fox's licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> seriously.|$|E
500|$|Graham praised {{his opponents}} – [...] "There {{is no need}} to <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> away from Liverpool because they were terrific," [...] and felt his team could have been more clinical.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4½ stars and states [...] "While the Standards Trio rarely <b>takes</b> <b>anything</b> for granted, {{transforming}} {{everything in its}} path, the results are not quite as inventive here as on other releases".|$|R

500|$|The {{appearance}} of DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy was kept a secret, {{with the character}} only being referred to in scripts as [...] "Admiral". While Roddenberry had wanted Kelley to appear, {{he thought that the}} actor would turn him down. The two had lunch together and Roddenberry suggested the appearance, with Kelley agreeing not only to appear, but also that he wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> more than the Screen Actor's Guild base salary for the part. He later said, [...] "I just wanted scale, to let it be my way of saying thank you to Gene for the many good things he has done for me".|$|E
500|$|Brahm did {{not expect}} the message {{to be taken seriously}} since he [...] "would never <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> posted on 4chan as fact"; an FBI {{official}} was quoted as saying the [...] "credibility of [...] was beyond ridiculous". As a parody of the incident, 4chan temporarily added [...] "Don't mess with football" [...] as an additional rule for /b/. On October 20, 2006, Brahm turned himself in to federal authorities, and was charged with fabricating a fake terrorist threat and taken into custody. On February 28, 2008, he pleaded guilty to the federal charges. On June 5, 2008, he was sentenced to six months in prison, six months' house arrest, and ordered to pay $26,750 in restitution.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, {{the couple}} would stay at Uriage for {{mountaineering}} {{all the way}} up to the glacier, getting sun burnt in the process. She also went hunting with her husband, using an 18mm rifle, in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars, but disliked killing birds. She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the execution of the Russian imperial family, a view shared by many fellow centenarians. The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because [...] "they did not <b>take</b> <b>anything</b> away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with copper sulfate the day before, developed jaundice and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on October 2, 1942 at the age of 73. Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.|$|E
