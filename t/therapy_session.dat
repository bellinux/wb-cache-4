Answers given to the psychological tests in the <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey.|$|E

5|$|The {{new edition}} of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games {{incorporates}} elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} during a <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray astrophysics realistically, but {{as a way to}} examine the human psyche during a disaster.|$|E

25|$|Primarily {{inspired}} by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, the lyricism {{on the record}} is substantially more introspective and the music more developed. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a <b>therapy</b> <b>session,</b> splitting the album between up-tempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at Washington farm studio Bear Creek were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled {{that most of his}} material was re-recorded and left the band shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of the past of the sick person. This was done in a methodological fashion, first inquiring about ascriptive attributes, followed by specific events of the person’s life, and lastly about circumstantial or acquired attributes. This aspect of the medicine man’s job would be similar to a modern-day <b>therapy</b> <b>session.</b> In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a medicine man may prescribe a remedy to his patient. The number of times or days that the remedy should be ingested or applied depended on an individual’s gender; typically the number thirteen was associated with men, and the number nine with women.|$|E
25|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown, {{tension between the}} team rose when McCool refused to tag Layla into a match against Kelly and Phoenix. Layla {{continued}} trying to fix their relationship, but McCool was resistant. Tension was further highlighted in a SmackDown scene where the two were seen undergoing couples therapy. When Layla lost a singles match against Kelly despite McCool's attempts to help her, McCool told Layla she was sick of doing all her work for her, and shoved her over. Finally, On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, McCool turned on Layla by attacking her after the <b>therapy</b> <b>session,</b> thereby disbanding LayCool. During the 2011 WWE Draft, McCool cost Layla a match against Eve Torres. After the match, McCool tried to taunt and bully Layla again, however Layla snapped after all her efforts at trying to keep LayCool together, and viciously attacked McCool, saying she was sick of her, before throwing her at the announce table, thus turning face in the process. On the April 29 episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool fought to a no contest. After the match, Layla challenged McCool to a No Count Out, No Disqualification match at Extreme Rules. McCool accepted on one condition that the loser leaves WWE. On May 1 at Extreme Rules 2011, Layla defeated McCool which meant {{she had to leave}} WWE. After the match, a debuting Kharma came out and attacked McCool with the Implant Buster. Layla retired on July 29, 2015.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the eleventh season, Callie and Arizona gave therapy another chance in order to help mend their marriage.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the treatment of}} a case of severe insomnia. The treatment, a variant of systematic desensitization, was short and apparently quite successful.

500|$|... "Rosemary's Baby" [...] {{was named}} {{as one of}} the [...] "Top 11 TV Episodes of 2007" [...] by UGO, and ranked thirteenth on The Futon Critics list of [...] "the 50 Best Episodes of 2007"; both citing the Baldwin and Morgan therapy scene as the reason. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{declared}} it as [...] "one of 30 Rock's best episodes ever" [...] He praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was [...] "insane", the episode still managed [...] "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene [...] "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has [...] "great storylines to great guest stars", making it [...] "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene [...] "the best moment of the episode". [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] " [...] Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's <b>therapy</b> <b>session,</b> this 2007 episode was so wrong. And so good." [...] In 2016 Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the episode as [...] "the keys-to-all-mythologies of female comedy", which A. O. Scott of The New York Times said [...] "may actually be an understatement. The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of second-wave feminism, and Liz's ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence". Scott added that given Lemon's depiction as a Star Wars fan, [...] "the casting of Ms. Fisher ... adds about 12 dimensions of meta".|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 2002, [...] "Without You" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had [...] "a very small cache of recorded material stored away", including [...] "Without You". [...] "Without You" [...] was followed by [...] "Luv Your Life", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a <b>therapy</b> <b>session,</b> {{based on the idea}} that [...] "there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy." [...] Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said [...] "Luv Your Life" [...] was dedicated [...] "to all my ladies".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the game, an old {{video clip}} from Cheryl's {{camcorder}} is played. Four variations of this clip are available depending upon the player's actions as Harry. In [...] "Love Lost", Harry packs his luggage in a car and tells Cheryl not to blame herself for her parents' separation. In [...] "Drunk Dad", a drunken Harry yells at Cheryl, demands a beer and blames his drinking on his family. In [...] "Sleaze and Sirens", Harry flirts on his bed with Lisa and Michelle. In [...] "Wicked and Weak", Dahlia verbally abuses Harry and slaps him. In the [...] "UFO" [...] joke ending, Cheryl tells Dr. Kaufmann that she believes Harry was kidnapped by aliens and that Silent Hill is a spaceship. After James Sunderland interrupts, the <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> continues, revealing Cheryl to be a dog and Dr. Kaufmann to be a grey alien. Regardless of the ending, the final scene shows Cheryl packing away mementos that the player can collect throughout the game. An additional scene the player can obtain shows her reconciling with Dahlia outside the clinic.|$|E

500|$|Callie Maggotbone {{creates a}} clone of Mark Lilly {{to replace him}} in the Department of Integration's (D.O.I.) bowling tournament, as the real Mark is a [...] "terrible bowler". The clone, who has blonde hair instead of brown, has a sadistic worldview and hides the real Mark in his closet. The {{following}} day, Twayne Boneraper hires a new assistant named Tad to do his dirty work. Tad's first action is to reassign Callie, whom he thinks is a saboteur, to a useless department in sub-basement 37. Tad also cuts Mark's department's budget by 80%, but is rather impressed by the Clone Mark's attitude. The next day at his group <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> with Mark's students, Clone Mark turns it into a fight club to train them for the bowling tournament. Later, Clone Mark finds Callie's diary at her apartment and finds out that she plans to murder him after the tournament and then get the real Mark back. Infuriated, he decides to murder Tad and frames Callie for the crime by using a trident from her apartment as the weapon and leaving it at the scene. Callie gets hauled in by Frank Grimes and his crew, but Grimes finds Mark's behavior strange and decides to investigate further.|$|E
500|$|...

The song discusses the band's Best New Artist Grammy loss, and Wentz calls it the [...] "most narcissistic song on the album". The line [...] "Fix me in forty-five" [...] is {{a reference to the}} length of a <b>therapy</b> <b>session.</b> On [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song [...] "kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at the way we are so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves – {{to the point where it}} just becomes oversaturated." [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer..." [...] has been described as [...] "about as close to a love song as you'll get from this band, a rare moment of tenderness among songs about blog entries, guest lists, and therapy sessions." [...] In a tribute to the politicized Chicago hardcore scene, Wentz describes the story of a rigged court case of African-American civil rights activist Fred Hampton, Jr. in [...] "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave".

500|$|He awakens in a {{wheelchair}} pushed by Cybil in the town's hospital. Before Cybil can tell him about his file at the station, the town transitions to the Nightmare. Harry escapes and meets Lisa Garland, a nurse injured in a crash, and escorts her to her home. At her request, Harry gives Lisa pills for her headache, and returns to find her either dead or dying, depending on in-game actions taken by the player. Finding him next to Lisa's corpse, Cybil attempts to arrest him, but is frozen as the Nightmare emerges around them. Harry escapes to Cheryl's home, where he finds an older Dahlia who claims to be his wife and tells him that Cheryl is at the lighthouse. Harry enters the Nightmare, escapes it, and eventually gets a ride from Michelle. Harry finds a young-again Dahlia aboard a boat at a lakeside harbour, who sets the course for the lighthouse and seduces him. Harry wakes, finds an aged Dahlia and the environment covered in ice, and crosses the now-frozen lake but falls {{into the water and}} passes out. Harry is dragged ashore near the lighthouse by Cybil, who confronts him with the news that Harry Mason died eighteen years ago in a car accident. As Harry proceeds, he finds [...] "the lighthouse" [...] is the name of Dr. Kaufmann's counseling clinic: the patient in the <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> is an adult Cheryl, who is in denial over her father's death.
