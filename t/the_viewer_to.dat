5|$|The {{film was}} later re-released {{in a limited}} edition DVD that {{features}} an audio commentary by Christopher Nolan, the original short story by Jonathan Nolan on which the film was based, and a Sundance Channel documentary on {{the making of the}} film. The limited edition DVD also contains a hidden feature that allows <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> watch the film in chronological order.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E

5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|Memento was {{released}} on DVD and VHS in the United States and Canada on September 4, 2001, and in the United Kingdom on January 14, 2002. The UK edition contains a hidden feature that allows <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> watch the film in chronological order. The Canadian version does not have this feature but the film chapters are set up to do this manually or through DVD programming. The original US release {{does not have the}} chronological feature nor are the chapters set up correctly to do it.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October 2012, Del Piero {{made his}} A-League debut with Sydney FC in a 2–0 away loss against Wellington Phoenix. Del Piero scored his first {{goal for the}} club from a free-kick in 3–2 loss to Newcastle Jets on 13 October, in his first home game for Sydney. The match against Newcastle {{featured}} hero-cam, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> track Del Piero's movements with one camera throughout the game. On 20 October, Del Piero scored the winning goal against Western Sydney Wanderers FC (1–0), making history with the first goal in the first Sydney Derby.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> feel a little sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with {{the tone of the}} film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
50|$|Jerry Lewis often {{sings the}} song on his annual Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon with altered lyrics that {{speak of the}} need for <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> call in their pledge.|$|R
50|$|Bravo {{had set up}} {{an online}} hub in order <b>to</b> let <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with <b>the</b> show's cast throughout the series' run. The website included the cast biographies, their social media accounts, behind-the-scenes videos, and other material. After each episode the network hosted live Twitter Q&A sessions as well as gave <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> an opportunity <b>to</b> appear on the show by uploading short social videos.|$|R

5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> first {{believe that it is}} Mac's funeral, but then a giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although comments made by the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with a moose. The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E
5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when {{played at the}} usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether {{or not they were}} actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
5000|$|Fellowes {{described}} his {{solution to the}} murder of Charles Bravo as: [...] "surprising...there is definitely a sting in the tail. My wife and son both said I got it wrong. I want <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> decide." ...|$|R

5|$|In August 2006, Warner Bros. {{announced}} 300 {{release date}} as March 16, 2007, but in October the release was moved forward to March 9, 2007. An unfinished cut of 300 was shown at Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival on December 9, 2006. 300 {{was released on}} DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and HD DVD on July 31, 2007, in Region 1 territories, in single-disc and two-disc editions. 300 was released in single-disc and steelcase two-disc editions on DVD, BD and HD DVD in Region 2 territories beginning August 2007. On July 21, 2009, Warner Bros. released a new Blu-ray Disc entitled 300: The Complete Experience {{to coincide with the}} Blu-ray Disc release of Watchmen. This new Blu-ray Disc is encased in a 40-page Digibook and includes all the extras from the original release as well as some new ones. These features include a Picture-in-Picture feature entitled The Complete 300: A Comprehensive Immersion, which enables <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> view the film in three different perspectives. This release also includes a digital copy.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Etty {{declined}} {{after his}} death as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which Candaules can be considered an influence is The Knight Errant, painted by John Everett Millais in 1870, which in its depiction of a rape victim, distraught and with her face turned away from the viewer, was a return to the style developed by Etty in Candaules of forcing <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and which drew similar criticism.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E
