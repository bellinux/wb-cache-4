[...] "I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And {{there was a lot of}} work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it." ...|$|E

As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead. I gave a rotten show that night. I grew up with the terrible feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> laughed at".|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E

30|$|Of the {{subjective}} items, the item ‘I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>being</b> watched’ {{has a strong}} negative correlation with ‘People do not interact with each other’ (− 0.75, p =  0.01), which suggests the respondents’ anticipation for more neighborly contact within neighborhoods with side setback areas. ‘I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>being</b> watched’ and ‘People respect privacy’ were negatively correlated (− 0.65, p =  0.01), which suggests a concern with privacy. So do the items ‘Having windows facing side setback areas affect privacy’ and ‘Having ventilation from windows to side setback areas is enough, view is not important’ (– 0.69, p =  0.01), plus the fact that respondents anticipate more from the windows than only light or ventilation.|$|R

2500|$|Political {{messages}} were also occasionally {{displayed in the}} backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness. For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, [...] "(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> particularly subversive, although I was a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|Romoşan, who {{had earlier}} denied {{involvement}} with the Securitate, claimed that Negoiţescu had actually both been recruited as an agent since their release from prison in the 1960s, and had spied for the Securitate's foreign bureau during his time in Germany. Speaking after Corlăţan's article, he admitted having functioned as a Securitate informer, but not before 1987, when his wife, writer Adina Kenereş, was threatened with losing her travel privileges. He indicated that his signature on any other such documents was obtained {{with the use of}} violence and intimidation. He argued: [...] "I presently think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> used by the Securitate, which destroyed my reputation in order to provide Negoiţescu with a cover", and claims that Negoiţescu himself apologized to him for [...] "all the harm" [...] during a chance meeting in the early 1990s. According to Nistorescu's assessment: [...] "When the threads of Negoiţescu's file will come loose, perhaps I'll understand something from [...] adventure." [...] In contrast, Morar and Ştefan Agopian both assessed that Romoşan's own flight abroad was part of a Securitate diversion. Literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu gave Romoşan's claims {{the benefit of the doubt}} and urged for the Negoiţescu file to be publicized in its entirety, but also asserted that Romoşan had lost his credibility.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Stewart made a short video against {{domestic}} violence for Amnesty International, {{in which he}} recollected his father's physical attacks on his mother and the effect it had on him as a child. For instance, he said, [...] "the physical harm... a shocking pain. But there are other aspects of violence which have more lasting impact psychologically on family members. It is destructive and tainting. As a child witnessing these events, one cannot simply help somehow feeling responsible for them; for the pain, and the screaming, and the misery." [...] In the same year, he gave his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he is Chancellor, to fund post-graduate study into {{domestic violence}}. Stewart's childhood experience also led {{him to become a}} patron of Refuge, a UK charity for abused women. In 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the launch of Created Equal, a book about women's rights, talking again about his personal experiences with domestic violence and the impacts they had on him. He remarked, [...] "violence is a choice and it's a choice a man makes...the lasting impact on my mother...and indeed on myself...was extreme. Overcoming the lessons of that male stereotype <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> shown was a struggle." [...] He now hopes to set an example of [...] "what it has been like to be in an environment of such violence and that it can pass and that one can survive it and even though sometimes still a struggle." [...] Additionally, in October 2011, he presented a BBC Lifeline Appeal on behalf of Refuge, discussing his own experience of domestic violence and interviewing a woman whose daughter was murdered by her ex-husband.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E

30|$|In {{support of}} the above assumption, the item ‘People do not interact’ was {{correlated}} with the preference of having a Green wall (0.65, p =  0.01). ‘I prefer to look at neighbor’s clothes-drying space’ was correlated with ‘I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>being</b> watched’ (0.60, p =  0.01), which further proves that the respondents preferred the neighboring building to have a clothes-drying space as a threshold which {{is believed to be}} less frequently used than terraces and balconies, so that their privacy is protected.|$|R
