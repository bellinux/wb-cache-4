5|$|After the Headingley Test, Loxton {{came in at}} 5/344 {{and made}} an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia {{enforced}} the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E

5|$|Miller then {{played for}} Tasmania Combined XI—which {{consisted}} mainly of Victorians—against Hammond's tourists in Hobart. He scored 70 and 30, {{opening in the}} second innings, and took a wicket in each innings, removing Evans and Ikin as the match ended in a draw. This {{was followed by a}} match against Queensland in Brisbane in which Miller scored 81 batting at No. 3, featuring in a 93-run stand with Meuleman as Victoria amassed 466. He then took 3/21 in the hosts' first innings, removing opener Geoff Cook before returning late in the innings <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> of the last three wickets. Hassett asked the Queenslanders to follow on and Miller took 1/20 and two catches as the hosts were defeated by an innings and 13 runs. Miller had a light workload with the ball as Hassett asked him to deliver only 15.4 eight-ball overs.|$|E
5|$|Surrey {{visited the}} County Ground, Taunton {{a few days}} later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their {{previous}} fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness {{of the rest of the}} county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} matches, Dane van Niekerk made the highest {{score of the}} competition, 91 runs, to propel the Loughborough Lightning to 168 for 6, the highest team total of the tournament. During the Surrey Stars' response, van Niekerk {{was also one of}} three bowlers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> wickets to help limit the Stars to 134 runs, and secure the Lightning a place at finals days. The Vipers travelled to Taunton unbeated before their match against the Western Storm. Batting first, the Vipers reached 137 for 3; Suzie Bates scored 57 runs and Charlotte Edwards got 30. In their reply, the Western Storm lost Rachel Priest early, but two big partnership involving Stafanie Taylor, who scored 78 not out, helped them to victory with 13 balls remaining. The final match of the day pitted the two northern sides against each other in the women's 'Roses' match. Yorkshire batted first in Manchester and scored 166; Alex Blackwell got 59 runs, and a slow over-rate meant that Yorkshire received six additional runs before the final over. In Lancashire's chase, Danielle Hazell took four wickets, and Katherine Brunt took a hat-trick to bowl the Thunder out for 71 runs. That meant that Yorkshire and Lancashire had each won once during the tournament, and irrespective of results in the last round of group matches, neither could qualify for finals day; both the Southern Vipers and Western Storm would join the Loughborough Lightning.|$|E

5|$|The 2010–11 season saw {{virtually}} no {{change to the}} structure of the season or league. All teams from the previous season remained in the league, and the number of games remained at 36. The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, with a couple of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final {{for the first time in}} their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could not go on. On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.|$|E
5|$|With {{his three}} {{divisions}} reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw {{action at the}} Battle of Borodino. He {{was placed on the}} French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of {{the right wing of the}} army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. During this mission, he was exposed to great danger, to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.|$|E
