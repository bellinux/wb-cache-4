5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} responded to <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> {{values of the}} day. If a single {{function}} were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture {{and the needs of}} the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between {{the federal government and the}} other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1868, Khrimian {{was ordained}} as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 {{he was elected}} as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian {{community}} of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) class and the imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet {{in the eyes of}} the Sublime Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used the position to advance <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E

25|$|During his {{clinical}} rotations at the Boston City Hospital, Crichton grew {{disenchanted with}} the culture there, which appeared to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> reputations of doctors over the interests of patients. He graduated from Harvard, obtaining an MD in 1969, and undertook a post-doctoral fellowship study at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, from 1969 to 1970. He never obtained a license to practice medicine, devoting himself to his writing career instead.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, some {{southern}} states began to make petitioning for freedom more difficult. Maryland, for example, in 1796 required that county courts serve as the court of original jurisdiction, rather than the General Court of the Western Shore, an appellate court. The county courts clearly would be more favorable to <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> views of the local planters against whom these suits were often filed. The legislature also banned those with antislavery sympathies from serving on juries in freedom suits. Virginia passed a similar law on jury composition in 1798.|$|E

The MLKCLC is affiliated with the national AFL-CIO, the central labor organization in the United States, which represents more than 13million working people. Over 125 organizations are affiliated with the MLKCLC, and more than 75,000 {{working men and women}} belong to Council-affiliated organizations.

25|$|In 1631, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) {{suspended}} Minuit {{from his}} post {{for reasons that are}} unclear, but probably for (perhaps unintentionally) abetting the landowning patroons who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> orders of the West India Company. He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions, but was dismissed and was succeeded as director by Wouter van Twiller. It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Cabinet wives {{insisted that}} <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> honor of all American women was at stake. They {{believed}} a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without {{the assurance that}} went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian Daniel Walker Howe notes {{that this was the}} feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.|$|E

25|$|Recognizing {{the growing}} number of manumissions and {{petition}} cases after the Revolution, most southern states began to make petitioning more difficult. For example, in 1796, Maryland required that county courts serve as the court of original jurisdiction for petition for freedom cases, rather than the General Court of the Western Shore, an appellate court. The county courts were considered to be more favorable to <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> views of local planters against whom these suits were often filed. That year, Maryland passed a law banning persons of known anti-slavery sympathies from serving on juries in freedom suits. Virginia enacted a similar law in 1798.|$|E
25|$|Hull House enabled Addams {{to befriend}} {{and become a}} {{colleague}} to early members of the Chicago School of Sociology. Her influence, through her work in applied sociology, impacted the thought {{and direction of the}} Chicago School of Sociology's members. In 1893, she co-authored the compilation of essays written by Hull House residents and workers titled, Hull-House Maps and Papers. These ideas helped shape and define <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> methodologies of the Chicago School. She worked with American philosopher, George H. Mead, on social reform issues, including promoting women's rights, ending child labor, and mediating during the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. This strike in particular bent thoughts of protests because it dealt with women workers, ethnicity, and working conditions. All of these subjects were key items that Addams wanted to see in the society.|$|E
25|$|An article {{published}} by Vietnam News echoed {{some of the}} challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces {{in preparation for the}} AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Import-Export Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study the ASEAN market, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge for Vietnam, the article stated, is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.|$|E

25|$|Ban Thomas Erdődy {{wanted to}} take {{advantage}} of the victory and take Petrinja, where the remnants of the Ottoman army fled. However, Colonel General Eggenberg considered that there was not enough food for their army and the attack on Petrinja was halted. After news of the defeat reached Constantinople, a revenge was demanded from the military leaders and the Sultan's sister, whose son Mehmed was killed in the battle. Although the action of Hasan Pasha was not in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> policy of the Porte, the Sultan felt that such an embarrassing defeat even of a vassal acting off his own bat could not go unavenged. Sultan Murad III declared war on Emperor Rudolf II that same year, starting the Long War that was fought mainly in Hungary and Croatia. The war extended through the reign of Mehmed III (1595-1603) and into that of Ahmed I (1603-1617).|$|E
25|$|The Labour Party {{originated}} in the late 19th century, meeting the demand for a new political party to represent <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> needs of the urban working class, a demographic which had increased in number, and many of whom only gained suffrage {{with the passage of}} the Representation of the People Act 1884. Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. The first Lib–Lab candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-election of 1870. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the Independent Labour Party, the intellectual and largely middle-class Fabian Society, the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and the Scottish Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{not only}} prehistoric, pre-literate {{cultures}} that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of historical archaeology. For many literate cultures, such as Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite classes, such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple. The literacy even of aristocrats has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. <b>The</b> <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually {{a small fraction of the}} larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as sampling bias and differential preservation.|$|E
