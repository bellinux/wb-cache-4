50|$|Another {{environmental}} factor influencing levels of food neophobia {{is the current}} arousal level of the individual. Trying a new food is an arousing experience, and if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> to maintain a lower arousal level in general, then {{he or she might}} avoid new foods as a method of managing his or her current arousal level. Also, if people are currently experiencing situations with a lot of novelty and are therefore more aroused, they might be reluctant to try new foods as doing so would increase their arousal level to an uncomfortable level. This example can help explain why Americans visiting a foreign country might be less likely to try a new food item and instead gravitate towards the familiar McDonald’s food.|$|E

If a terminally ill <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> would <b>prefer</b> to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|R

5000|$|Strabismus, {{sometimes}} also incorrectly called lazy eye, is {{a condition}} in which the eyes are misaligned. Strabismus usually results in normal vision in the preferred sighting (or [...] "fellow") eye (the eye that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> to use), but may cause abnormal vision in the deviating or strabismic eye due to the difference between the images projecting to the brain from the two eyes.Adult-onset strabismus usually causes double vision (diplopia), since the two eyes are not fixed on the same object.Children's brains, however, are more neuroplastic, so can more easily adapt by suppressing images from one of the eyes, eliminating the double vision. This plastic response of the brain, however, interrupts the brain's normal development, resulting in the amblyopia. Recent evidence points to a cause of infantile strabismus lying with the input to the visual cortex.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the relationship between interest, current participation, and desire for future participation in each activity listed in the Japanese Interest Checklist for the Elderly. Method: Data were collected from 375 community-dwelling older Japanese people through individual interviews using the revised Japanese Interest Checklist for the Elderly, which contains 25 activities. Responses in interest, current participation, and desire for future participation were analysed across activity and gender. Findings: Interest, current participation, and desire for future participation in activities correlated significantly and positively for both genders. Three different situations were identified: (1) participants could not currently participate in activities despite showing interest; (2) they were not currently engaged in activities but wished to participate them in the future; and (3) they preferred not to participate in the specific activities in the future, despite currently showing interest. Conclusion: There is a need for occupational therapists, therefore, to understand these findings in considering appropriate therapeutic options. Moreover, occupational therapists need to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> not to participate in some activities, despite showing interest and/or participation in interests more generally. © The College of Occupational Therapists Ltd...|$|E

For this reason, it is preferable to try several strategies in an attempt to determine what works best for each individual. As the healthcare professional, your role is to help the individual understand how to use these strategies, but the individual is responsible for practice and implementation between sessions. Explain that there is a requirement of commitment and effort on their part. Typically, you would identify target areas or goals to work on, practise a number of different strategies, and then decide which strategies <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> and can use most efficiently. Preferred strategies can be selected for additional practice until the individual feels confident using them.

40|$|People’s {{behavior}} {{in relation to}} objects depends on whether they are owned. But how do people judge whether objects are owned? We propose that people expect human-made objects (artifacts) to {{be more likely to}} be owned than naturally occurring objects (natural kinds), and we examine the development of these expectations in young children. Experiment 1 found that when shown pictures of familiar kinds of objects, 3 -year-olds expected artifacts to be owned and inanimate natural kinds to be non-owned. In Experiments 2 A and 2 B, 3 – 6 -year-olds likewise had different expectations about the ownership of unfamiliar artifacts and natural kinds. Children at all ages viewed unfamiliar natural kinds as non-owned, but children younger than 6 years of age only endorsed artifacts as owned at chance rates. In Experiment 3, children saw the same pictures but were also told whether objects were human-made. With this information provided, even 3 -year-olds viewed unfamiliar artifacts as owned. Finally, in Experiment 4, 4 - and 5 -year-olds chose unfamiliar artifacts over natural kinds when judging which object in a pair belongs to a person, but not when judging which <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers.</b> These experiments provide first evidence about how children judge whether objects are owned. In contrast to claims that children think about natural kinds as being similar to artifacts, the current findings reveal that children have differing expectations about whether they are owned...|$|E
40|$|The paper criticizes {{criminal}} law scholarship {{for helping to}} construct and failing to expose analytic structures that falsely claim {{a higher level of}} rationality and coherence than current {{criminal law}} theory deserves. It offers illustrations of three such illusions of rationality. First, it is common in criminal law discourse for scholars and judges to cite any of the standard litany of "the purposes of punishment" [...] just deserts, deterrence, incapacitation of the dangerous, rehabilitation, and sometimes other purposes [...] as a justification for one or another liability rule or sentencing practice. The cited "purpose" gives the rules an aura of rationality, but one that is, in large part, illusory. Without a principle defining the interrelation of the "purposes," nearly any rule can be justified by some "purpose of punishment. " Thus, a decision maker can switch among distributive principles as needed to provide an apparent rationale for whichever rule <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>prefers,</b> even if that preference is not based on rational criteria. A second example is found in a central mechanism for determining an offender's blameworthiness: the use of an individualized objective standard. The widely used mechanism avoids the problems acknowledged to attend a strictly objective standard. A person's situation and capacities are central to an assessment of whether a person can be fairly blamed for a violation, and the individualized objective standard allows the decision maker to take these into account. At the same time, the mechanism avoids reversion to a completely subjective standard, which might exempt many blameworthy cases from liability. In reality, however, the mechanism only shifts the form of the problem. Codes that use the individualized objective standard fail to provide a principle by which one can determine those characteristics of an offender with which the objective standard ought to be individualized and those with which * 288 it ought not. Without a governing principle, the issue again is left to the discretion of decision makers, with no guidance as to how that discretion is to be exercised. A final illusion obscures whether the criminal justice system is, in fact, in the business of "doing justice. " The "criminal justice" system imposes "punishment" and encourages moral condemnation of those found "guilty" of "crimes. " But while the system cultivates its doing-justice image, it increasingly shifts to a system of essentially preventive detention, where a violator's sanction is derived more from what is needed to incapacitate him from committing future offenses than to punish him for a past offense. There are great advantages to the deception, but also serious costs and inefficiencies. The paper discusses why some illusions are more objectionable than others and what the existence of such illusions says about modern criminal law scholarship. INTRODUCTION We criminal law theorists like to think that we are moving existing criminal law theory to a higher plateau of rationality, as furthering current understanding beyond that which was given to us by our criminal law theory predecessors. But the truth is that our advances in rationality often are less than they appear; they are sometimes advances only in their appearance of rationality. This article gives illustrations of three such illusions. As will become apparent, these illustrations are of different sorts: one demonstrates the inevitable limitation of any theoretical advance; one is an example of an inevitable limitation that has been unnecessarily retained over time; and one is a case of possibly cynical deception. The focus here is upon American criminal law and its development, but there is nothing special about American criminal law or theory on this point. These illusions are likely to have some form of counterpart in the criminal law theory of most legal systems. Legal Scholarship,...|$|E

The amount of information presented in a map is important for understandability and is thus an essential aspect of map usability. In addition, the limited memory capacities of many mobile devices make it necessary that only the most important information should be included. To gain a clearer picture of cartographic usability for small screen maps, a study of amount of information in mobile map services’ maps was performed. Fourteen different maps, with buildings generalized to different extents, were presented to users who graded these in order of preferred level of information. The study focused on amount of information as a quantitative measure of the syntactic contents of a map.

50|$|Karl Jaspers {{preserves}} the term 'neurasthenia', defining {{it in terms}} of 'irritable weakness' and describing phenomena such as irritability, sensitivity, a painful sensibility, abnormal responsiveness to stimuli, bodily pains, strong experience of fatigue, etc. This is contrasted with psychasthenia which, following Janet, he describes as a variety of phenomena 'held together by the theoretical concept of a 'diminution of psychic energy'.' <b>The</b> psychasthenic <b>person</b> <b>prefers</b> to 'withdraw from his fellows and not be exposed to situations in which his abnormally strong 'complexes' rob him of presence of mind, memory and poise.' The psychasthenic lacks confidence, is prone to obsessional thoughts, unfounded fears, self-scrutiny and indecision. This state in turn promotes withdrawal from the world and daydreaming, yet this only makes things worse. 'The psyche generally lacks an ability to integrate its life or to work through and manage its various experiences; it fails to build up its personality and make any steady development.' Jaspers believed that some of Janet's more extreme cases of psychasthenia were cases of schizophrenia.|$|R
