5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the series.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2017–18 season, the Avalanche {{unveiled}} new uniforms {{as part of}} {{the switch}} to Adidas. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> was inspired from the original uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2007, save for the bold silver border that pays homage to Colorado's silver mining industry.|$|E

5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of a test car {{that is used to}} go through multiple safety tests.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bands like}} Sarcofago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other black metal acts also adopted <b>the</b> <b>look.</b> Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of {{the film}} with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts {{of the film}} to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize {{all aspects of the}} CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled <b>the</b> <b>look.</b> The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going {{into and out of the}} save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E

5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 a new {{master plan}} called 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus was {{developed}} to guide future campus development.

5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match <b>the</b> <b>look</b> {{and texture of}} the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> behavior of married couples during a 10 minute interaction segment. The variables examined included marital adjustment level, interaction role (speaking or listening) {{and type of}} message. Wives {{were more likely to}} look at their spouses than husbands were, and speakers were more likely to look at their partners than were listeners. While high marital adjustment spouses looked less over all types of mesages, low marital adjustment spouses particularly <b>looked</b> more than <b>the</b> highs on negative messages, suggesting either a confrontation component to <b>the</b> <b>looking,</b> or a strong need to monitor the partner 2 ̆ 7 s reactions in such situations. There was also evidence of more displayed competitiveness in the low marital adjustment couples. Correlational analyses revealed that there were different relationships between <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> behavior of <b>the</b> speaking spouse and <b>the</b> <b>looking</b> behavior of <b>the</b> listening spouse, and between the spouses 2 ̆ 7 patterns of looking when speaking or listening and that these differences were dependent on marital adjustment level...|$|R
