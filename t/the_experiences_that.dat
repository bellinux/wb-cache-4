In its magnifying clarity, dim facets of the American character stand more clearly revealed.

The one who can interpret Oklahoma can grasp the meaning of America in the modern world.|$|E

The new unit needed to combine cross-border insurgency warfare to take the fight to the enemies' bases of operation in territory under hostile governmental control (which collectively virtually encircled Rhodesia), with domestic policing counter-insurgency operations of a more traditional colonial nature, both disciplines being drawn heavily from <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> both Walls and Reid-Daly had learned when they had fought alongside one another in the Malayan Emergency twenty years earlier. The new unit was the Selous Scouts.|$|E

500|$|... "Side Effects" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey from her eleventh studio album, E=MC² (2008). It was written by Carey, Scott Storch, Crystal Johnson and the songs featured artist, Young Jeezy. It was inspired by Carey's marriage to record executive Tommy Mottola and his controlling nature over her and her career. Carey discusses how she still deals with {{the side effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> she encountered during the relationship. Critical response to the song was positive, with many critics highlighting it as an album standout, praising its candid lyrics and honesty. It charted at number 93 on the U.S. Billboard Pop 100 chart upon the release of the album.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{medical and}} {{psychological}} investigations into consciousness {{are based on}} psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli), and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. [...] Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts. [...] The first identifies the content of consciousness with <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> are reported by human subjects; the second makes use {{of the concept of}} consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired. [...] In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.|$|E
500|$|Although Roberts {{had largely}} escaped {{criticism}} for his previous work, his novel Red Fox attracted attention from Burroughs {{and his allies}} after its publication in 1906. The work contains stories relating to a single animal, the eponymous Red Fox who was described by the author as [...] "fairly typical, both in his characteristics and in <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> befall him, {{in spite of the}} fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes." [...] Burroughs' critique of the book began by expressing his admiration for Roberts' [...] "genius", but again stressed his belief that animals were governed by instinct, rather than instruction or intuition. He pointed to particular passages, such as when the fox escaped a group of hounds by running across the backs of sheep on a field, as disingenuous and misleading.|$|E

500|$|Although verbal {{report is}} in {{practice}} the [...] "gold standard" [...] for ascribing consciousness, {{it is not}} the only possible criterion. [...] In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity and purposeful movement. [...] The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent. [...] The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive. [...] Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness. [...] Studies of the neuroscience of free will have also shown that <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> people report when they behave purposefully sometimes do not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains.|$|E
500|$|During {{the last}} days of May the 9th Division {{embarked}} at Morotai onto the ships which would transport it to Brunei Bay, and undertook rehearsals for the landing. Due to a shortage of shipping, the available vessels were heavily loaded and many soldiers were forced to endure cramped and hot conditions during the ten days before the landing. Australian official historian Gavin Long later wrote that for many troops these conditions [...] "were as uncomfortable as any of <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> followed" [...] during the campaign. The 24th Brigade Group was carried by a variety of landing ships: the two large Australian LSIs [...] and , as well the attack cargo ship , LSD , ten LSTs, five LCIs and seven LSMs from the United States Navy. A total of 38 small LCVPs and 26 LCMs were also assigned to land the brigade once it arrived off Labuan. Due to the coral reefs surrounding the island, the assault waves landed in LVTs of the US Army's 727th Amphibious Tractor Battalion. The convoy carrying the 9th Division left Morotai on 4 June and arrived in Brunei Bay before dawn on 10 June. The main body of the convoy anchored off Labuan, and the remainder proceeded to the Brunei area. A Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb near two of the transport ships off Labuan at 6:51 am, but caused no damage.|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Allied {{sinking of}} Sanct Svithun [...] an unescorted Norwegian {{passenger}} ship [...] led to strong reactions in Norway, {{with the leadership}} of the Norwegian resistance movement sending a letter of protest to the press office of the Norwegian government in exile in London on 20 October 1943. In the letter the resistance stated that [...] "We have received message from a trusted source in Western Norway who has been gathering reliable intelligence from eye witnesses and survivors about the sinking of Sanct Svithun. He declares that the German reports in the media are by and large correct. When the negative impacts have not been greater, the reason is that everyone back home refuse to believe that the English could have behaved in such a manner. This is in conflict with <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> people back home have made over almost three years. If anything like this was to happen again, it would be highly damaging." [...] The letter was presented to Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Trygve Lie and debated in a government conference.|$|E

My childhood was in reality a very mixed experience, full of fever, nightmare, insomnia, painful days and interminable nights; and I can speak with less authority of gardens than of that other [...] "land of counterpane." [...] But to what end should we renew these sorrows? The sufferings of life may be handled by the very greatest in their hours of insight; it is of its pleasures that our common poems should be formed; these are <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> we should seek to recall or to provoke; and I say with Thoreau, [...] "What right have I to complain, who have not ceased to wonder?"

Let no one who sincerely desires to help the work on in this way, delay going through any fear; for the worth of life lies in <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> fill it, {{and this is one}} which cannot be forgotten. All that is best and bravest in the hearts of men and women, comes out in scenes like these; and, though a hospital is a rough school, its lessons are both stern and salutary; and the humblest of pupils there, in proportion to his faithfulness, learns a deeper faith in God and in himself. I, for one, would return tomorrow, on the [...] "up-again,-and-take-another" [...] principle, if I could; for the amount of pleasure and profit I got out of that month compensates for all the pangs; and, though a sadly womanish feeling, I take some satisfaction in the thought that, if I could not lay my head on the altar of my country, I have my hair; and that is more than handsome Helen did for her dead husband, when she sacrificed only the ends of her ringlets on his urn. Therefore, I close this little chapter of hospital experiences, with the regret that they were no better worth recording; and add the poetical gem with which I console myself for the untimely demise of [...] "Nurse Periwinkle:" ...|$|E
