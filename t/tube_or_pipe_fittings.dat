40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the Appellate Body (AB) report on European Community - Antidumping Duties on Malleable Cast Iron <b>Tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>Pipe</b> <b>Fittings</b> from Brazil. The underlying Panel determination was appealed by the complainant Brazil only. Following the approach it took before the Panel, Brazil raised {{a number of}} issues concerning the antidumping investigation by the European Community (EC...|$|E

5000|$|The Latin word fistula ( [...] or [...] or , plural fistulas [...] or fistulae [...] or [...] ) {{literally}} means <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nested wells, also {{referred}} to as nested monitoring wells, are composed of multiple <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes,</b> typically terminating with short screened intervals (2-3 ft), installed in single boreholes. Sand packs must be installed at the screen depths and seals in the borehole are constructed between the sand packs. Nested wells are different from well clusters in that the latter consists of a cluster of wells where <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> are constructed in separate, individual boreholes that are drilled and completed at different depths.|$|R
5000|$|... a {{transparent}} <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> for distribution of light over its length, either for equidistribution {{along the entire}} length (see also sulfur lamp) or for controlled light leakage.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston valve}} is a device {{used to control}} the motion of a fluid along a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> {{by means of the}} linear motion of a piston within a chamber or cylinder.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to lengths of <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> tubing, <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are used in}} plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions. <b>Pipe</b> and <b>fittings</b> are held in place with pipe hangers and strapping.|$|R
50|$|Multiple-element {{compression}} seal fittings are used when multiple {{elements of the}} same or different diameters such as metal tubing, ceramic <b>or</b> rigid plastic <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe,</b> temperature probe, a tubewell, low voltage instrumentation wire, or a power supply feedthrough.|$|R
50|$|Most {{expedient}} blast shelters are {{civil engineering}} structures that contain large buried <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Even these, nonetheless, require several additions to serve properly: blast doors, air-filtration and ventilation equipment, secondary exits, and air-proofing.|$|R
50|$|The product {{must now}} be cooled and this is usually {{achieved}} by pulling the extrudate through a water bath. Plastics are very good thermal insulators and are therefore difficult to cool quickly. Compared to steel, plastic conducts its heat away 2,000 times more slowly. In a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> extrusion line, a sealed water bath is acted upon by a carefully controlled vacuum to keep the newly formed and still molten <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> from collapsing. For products such as plastic sheeting, the cooling is achieved by pulling {{through a set of}} cooling rolls. For films and very thin sheeting, air cooling can be effective as an initial cooling stage, as in blown film extrusion.|$|R
50|$|A fireman's pole (also {{called a}} sliding pole, firepole, or tom) is a wooden pole <b>or</b> a metal <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> {{installed}} between floors in fire stations, allowing firefighters responding to an alarm to quickly descend {{to the ground}} floor faster than by using a standard staircase.|$|R
50|$|Tube bending as {{a process}} starts with loading a tube into a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> bender and {{clamping}} it into place between two dies, the clamping block and the forming die. The tube is also loosely held by two other dies, the wiper die and the pressure die.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, the blowgun is {{classified}} as a prohibited weapon and is defined as any device that [...] "being a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> designed {{for the purpose of}} shooting arrows or darts by the breath". Any imported blowgun must be deactivated by either drilling a hole or by blocking it.|$|R
5000|$|Mini {{choppers}} are scaled-down {{versions of}} custom-built motorcycles known as choppers and are generally constructed from 1" [...] steel tubing or 3/4" [...] steel black <b>pipe.</b> The <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> is bent and then welded {{together to get}} the desired angles and shapes of the frame, which is usually custom made.|$|R
50|$|Flaring TechnologyAfter {{putting a}} F37 flange onto a {{seamless}} hydraulic <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe,</b> the <b>tube</b> end will be flared to 37°, what also explains {{the name of}} this technology. The flaring is done by a special orbitally flaring process, which compresses the surface of the pipe end, gaining an excellent sealing surface.|$|R
50|$|As a {{malleable}} filling {{to prevent}} {{tubes and pipes}} from crimping when bent. Rose's metal is melted and poured into the tube. It then solidifies in place but remains malleable. This allows the <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> to be bent and reworked without crimping. After the desired shape is achieved the Rose's metal is remelted and removed, leaving the <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> <b>tube</b> in its modified shape.|$|R
50|$|A {{tube well}} {{is a type}} of water well in which a long 100 - 200 mm wide {{stainless}} steel <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> is bored into an underground aquifer. The lower end is fitted with a strainer, and a pump lifts water for irrigation. The required depth of the well depends on the depth of the water table.|$|R
50|$|This was {{originally}} done with chains and handcuffs, but other devices have been introduced, including tripods and <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> with handholds built in to link {{a person to}} an object or to create chains of people.Other common hardware includes padlocks, U-locks and other bicycle locks, lockboxes and tripods and platforms and other rigging in tree sitting.|$|R
50|$|Concentric <b>Tube</b> (<b>or</b> <b>Pipe)</b> Heat Exchangers {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{industries}} for purposes such as material processing, food preparation, and air-conditioning. They create a temperature driving force by passing fluid streams of different temperatures parallel to each other, separated by a physical boundary {{in the form of a}} pipe. This induces forced convection, transferring heat to/from the product.|$|R
40|$|Trailing shield ensures {{layer of}} inert gas covers hot, newly formed bead between two <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> joined by plasma arc welding. Inert gas protects weld bead from {{oxidation}} by air until cooler and {{less vulnerable to}} oxidation. Intended for use on nickel-base alloy pipes, on which weld beads remain hot enough to oxidize after primary inert-gas purge from welding-torch cup has passed...|$|R
5000|$|A tuyere or tuyère ( [...] ; [...] ) is a <b>tube,</b> nozzle <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> {{through which}} air is blown into a furnace or hearth.|$|R
50|$|Back-up {{rings are}} used in Polyethylene (PE) pipe connections, such as HDPE pipes, where they are {{connected}} to steel <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings.</b> The back-up ring is matched to the steel pipe flange specification and is placed behind the HDPE flange adapter - a end piece on the HDPE pipe that looks much like a steel flange {{at the end of}} the HDPE pipe. As the flange adapter does not have much structural strength, the back-up ring supports and compresses the HDPE flange adapter against the steel flange and creates an effective connection between the two piping materials.|$|R
50|$|A common {{application}} of laminar flow {{is in the}} smooth flow of a viscous liquid through a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe.</b> In that case, the velocity of flow varies from zero at the walls to a maximum along the cross-sectional centre of the vessel. The flow profile of laminar flow in a tube can be calculated by dividing the flow into thin cylindrical elements and applying the viscous force to them.|$|R
5000|$|A canal {{cut in a}} hard material, usually metal. This canal can be round, oval or an arc {{in order}} to receive another {{component}} such as a boss, a tongue or a gasket. It can also be on the circumference of a dowel, a bolt, an axle or on the outside or inside of a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> etc. This canal may receive a circlip an o-ring or a gasket.|$|R
50|$|To make {{a hole in}} <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> easily an annular cutter {{should be}} used with a {{magnetic}} base drilling machine and a tube/pipe clamping device. The tube clamping device is a metallic device which is clamped on the tube with an adjustable chain. After clamping the device the magnetic drilling machine {{is placed on the}} device, which gets clamped to the device by switching on its magnet.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{settings}} in the procedure {{is to ensure that}} the ultrasonic pulse initiates in the very focus point {{at the center of the}} <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe.</b> An off-center pulse will show a distorted image of the tube due to the difference in the sound path for either side of the tube wall. For that reason there are centering devices that help the operator to keep the turbine centered at all times.|$|R
50|$|The next word {{to appear}} in the 15th century that implied a slide was the sackbut group of words. There are two {{theories}} for the sources: it is either derived from the Middle French sacquer (to pull) and bouter (to push) or from the Spanish sacar (to draw or pull) and bucha (a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe).</b> The term survives in numerous English spelling variations including sacbut, sackbutte, sagbut, shagbolt, sacabushe, shakbusse and shakbusshe.|$|R
40|$|A frozen-plug {{technique}} has been {{conceived as a}} means of temporarily blocking the flow of liquid oxygen or its vapor through a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe.</b> The technique makes it possible to perform maintenance, repair, or other work on downstream parts of the cryogenic system in which the oxygen is used, without having to empty an upstream liquid-oxygen reservoir and, hence, without wasting the stored liquid oxygen and without subjecting the reservoir to the stresses of thermal cycling...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{mixing of}} materials {{is a basic}} requirement at some stage of most processes. Examples of unit operations include mixers, blenders, heat exchangers and reactors that often use dynamic mixers. Motionless mixers {{on the other hand}} contain no moving parts. The only power involved in their use is that associated with the small pressure drop produced by their insertion into a <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe.</b> Energy savings are typically 75 % to 90 % when compared to mechanical mixers. Case histories are described...|$|R
5000|$|Reduced risk {{of water}} damage: No stored water {{means there is}} no risk of water damage from a tank failure <b>or</b> rupture, though <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> <b>fitting</b> failure remains possible.|$|R
50|$|A reflex port is the {{distinctive}} {{feature of this}} popular enclosure type. The design approach enhances the reproduction of the lowest frequencies generated by the woofer or subwoofer. The port generally consists of one <b>or</b> more <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> mounted in the front (baffle) or rear face of the enclosure. Depending on the exact relationship between driver parameters, the enclosure volume (and filling if any), and the tube cross-section and length, the efficiency can be substantially improved over {{the performance of a}} similarly sized sealed-box enclosure.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} outlet ports {{establishes}} {{the number of}} outlets in the system. This is frequently specified as number of ports or valves that are or can {{be attached to the}} manifold. For example, an 8-point manifold has 8 ports or valves.Ports are sized based roughly on <b>tube</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> size with some important choices. For industrial gases it is possible to purchase manifolds made of Stainless steel <b>pipe</b> <b>or</b> copper and brass although both these materials are giving way to Stainless steel tubing. (Note differences between Tubing and Pipe). Connection choices might be NPT, VCO, Flare or othertypes.|$|R
5000|$|Evacuated tube {{collector}} arrays {{can be adjusted}} by removing/adding <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> their heat <b>pipes,</b> allowing customization during/after installation.|$|R
50|$|The basic plan is {{to provide}} a {{structure}} that is very strong in physical compression. The most common purpose-built structure is a buried, steel reinforced concrete vault or arch. Most expedient (makeshift) blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Improvised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 meter) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1-2 meter of tamped earth.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{a method}} to {{increase}} the residence time of bubbles in <b>tubes</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> filled with liquid metal is investigated. Imposing a horizontal electric current and a perpendicular horizontal magnetic field generates an upward-directed Lorentz force. This force can counteract gravity and cause floating of bubbles. Even with homogeneous electric fields these float in the mean but fluctuate randomly within the swarm due to mutual interactions. In the present case the cylindrical shape of the container furthermore creates inhomogeneous electric currents and an inhomogeneous force distribution resulting in a macroscopic convection pattern stirring the bubbles and further homogenising the spatial distribution of the bubbles...|$|R
50|$|This type of {{collector}} {{is generally}} used in solar power plants. A trough-shaped parabolic reflector {{is used to}} concentrate sunlight on an insulated <b>tube</b> (Dewar <b>tube)</b> <b>or</b> heat <b>pipe,</b> placed at the focal point, containing coolant which transfers heat from the collectors to the boilers in the power station.|$|R
