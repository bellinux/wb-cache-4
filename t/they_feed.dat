5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Larks {{are small}} {{terrestrial}} birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Most larks are fairly dull in appearance. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on insects and seeds.|$|E

50|$|The larvae live underground, where <b>they</b> <b>feeds</b> on {{the roots}} of various trees, {{including}} Casuarina and Eucalyptus species.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are {{subterranean}} and {{emerge from}} the soil to <b>feed.</b> <b>They</b> probably <b>feed</b> on fallen leaves.|$|R
25|$|Like most warblers, grey-breasted prinias are insectivorous. <b>They</b> <b>feeds</b> {{mainly on}} insects like ants, small beetles, {{caterpillars}} which are found among twigs and foliage of small trees. <b>They</b> also <b>feeds</b> on nectar from blossoms of trees like Erythrina and Bombax and during summer their forehead is sometimes sprinkled with pollen giving them an orange or yellowish head {{that can lead}} to mistaken identification.|$|R
5|$|Once {{they reach}} {{adulthood}} most adult cicada species live for around another {{two to four}} weeks. During this time <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on flowing sap from tree branches, and mating and egg laying occurs.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{are small}} birds which {{spend most of}} their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on planktonic {{crustaceans}} and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering across the water. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrels are {{relatives}} of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>feeds</b> on leaves, shoots, fruits, bark, roots, and buds. They can be pests of {{plantation}} crops. They {{also make}} a distinctive [...] "baby-like" [...] sound to communicate in the wild.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> {{apparently}} <b>feed</b> {{on small}} mammals. A captured, immature specimen {{was found to}} have eaten a common gray shrew (Crocidura attenuata). In captivity, these snakes are reported to be reluctant feeders, but when <b>they</b> did <b>feed,</b> <b>they</b> took newborn mice, and then only at night. On several occasions when feeding was observed, the prey was not released after being struck.|$|R
50|$|French grunts feed on invertebrates, such as krill. They tend to hunt {{in schools}} around sunset. After <b>they</b> finish <b>feeding</b> <b>they</b> {{return to the}} grass beds that they call their homes.|$|R
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>feed</b> {{on small}} fish and {{occasionally}} young octopodes. They are {{often associated with}} the sea snake barnacle (Platylepas ophiophila) which attaches to their skin.|$|E
5|$|Timema {{walking sticks}} are night-feeders who spend daytime {{resting on the}} leaves or bark of the plants <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on. Timema colors (primarily green, gray, or brown) and {{patterns}} (which may be stripes, scales, or dots) match their typical background, a form of crypsis.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> low over {{a variety of}} open habitats or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> larvae <b>feed</b> on Desmodium intortum (Fabaceae).|$|R
5000|$|Arrow darters usually feed on insect larvae, such as blackflies, caddisfly, and beetles. <b>They</b> also {{frequently}} <b>feed</b> on mayflies and midges. If the darter {{is greater than}} 2.8 inches, <b>they</b> often <b>feed</b> on small crayfish (Floyd, 2017).|$|R
50|$|After (that was finished) <b>they</b> didn't <b>feed</b> her any more.|$|R
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on more species when they are scattered. If they do not catch any food, they will enter a torpor similar to hibernation that day, awakening at night to hunt again.|$|E
50|$|The main {{food source}} is lichen but <b>they</b> also <b>feed</b> on Cyperaceae (sedges) and grasses along with twigs and mushrooms. Caribou {{have also been}} {{observed}} eating antlers and seaweed and licking salt deposits. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} on occasion <b>they</b> also <b>feed</b> on lemmings, Arctic char, and bird eggs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> mainly <b>feed</b> {{on small}} organisms and {{decaying}} flesh of dead animals.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{of small}} fish {{are the primary}} source of food for naked sand darters. <b>They</b> also <b>feed</b> on smaller {{crustaceans}} like copepods or clam larvae depending on their size. Naked sand darters feed continuously throughout the day, but stop at night. <b>They</b> also <b>feed</b> less in winter and summer months then pick back up before and after breeding season.|$|R
5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
5000|$|These {{polyphagous}} bugs can {{be found}} on many plants. <b>They</b> may <b>feed</b> on Trifolium, Chenopodium, Rumex, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Urticaceae and Asteraceae species. <b>They</b> also <b>feed</b> on potatoes, cereals, alfalfa and other crops, so the are considered a very harmful pest. Adults are present all year, but they are more abundant in late summer. They usually winter in leaf litter.|$|R
2500|$|Tumour ghosts ( [...] , [...] ) {{have large}} goiters on whose pus <b>they</b> must <b>feed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adults can be {{encountered}} from March through October. <b>They</b> mainly <b>feed</b> on aphids.|$|R
5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds with lobed toes and pointed bills. They are seen mainly on lowland waterbodies and coasts. <b>They</b> <b>feed</b> on aquatic animals and nest on a {{floating}} platform of vegetation. There are about 19 species worldwide with five in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Several {{wild boars}} (Sus scrofa) are {{native to the}} park. They are often found near the beaches where <b>they</b> <b>feed</b> on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E
5000|$|Tumour ghosts ( [...] , [...] ) {{have large}} goiters on whose pus <b>they</b> must <b>feed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adults {{only live}} {{for two to}} five days, as <b>they</b> cannot <b>feed</b> (Edwards 1993).|$|R
50|$|Judging by strandings, {{the whales}} occur in small groups. <b>They</b> {{probably}} <b>feed</b> on squid.|$|R
