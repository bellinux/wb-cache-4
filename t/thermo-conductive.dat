30|$|Ammonia temperature-programed {{desorption}} (NH 3 -TPD) {{was carried}} out to measure the surface acidity of the catalyst. First, 50  mg of catalyst were treated under helium flow (30  mL/min) at 250 °C for 2  h. After the pre-treatment, the catalyst was saturated with ammonia at 130 °C using pulse-wise injection. Finally, NH 3 -TPD desorption {{was carried out}} in helium at a heating rate of 10 °C/min within the temperature range of 130 to 700 °C. The signal was recorded by a <b>thermo-conductive</b> detector (TCD).|$|E
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time how boron nitride (BN) {{nanotubes}} and nanospheres may effectively be used to achieve remarkable thermal conductivity improvement of a fluid. Benefiting from high thermal conductivity and high-aspect-ratio of BN nanotubes, at a fraction of 6 vol %, the thermal conductivity of water was remarkably improved, up to approximately 2. 6 -times. With BN nanospheres as fillers, the viscosity of the fluid can be kept decently low and thermal conductivity can also be effectively improved. A combination of BN nanotubes and nanospheres was found to increase the fluid's thermal conductivity while keeping its viscosity low, thus, such mixtures can be promising fillers for highly <b>thermo-conductive</b> fluids. Finally, calculations based on finite element method were used to investigate the regarded nanofluids. On the basis of the results, thermal conductivity was estimated to be more than, or close to 200 W/mK for BN nanotubes and nanospheres, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Geothermal energy piles {{utilize the}} almost {{constant}} ground temperature at shallow depths below the ground surface to heat and/or cool built structures. Heat is extracted from and/or {{injected into the}} ground {{through the use of}} a heat carrier fluid that flows in pipes attached to the reinforcement cage of the pile foundations. The performance of the energy piles can be improved by enhancing the heat exchange between the heat carrier fluid and the ground. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence from literature on multidisciplinary methods to improve the thermal properties of elements in a geothermal energy pile. Geometrical optimization such as the number of pipes and their arrangement can be done to reduce the total pile thermal resistance. Nanofluids can be used as the heat carrier fluid to enhance the fluid conductive and convective heat transfer. Highly thermally conductive fillers can be mixed with the pipe material to enhance its thermal conductivity. The thermal properties of the concrete can also be enhanced by adding highly <b>thermo-conductive</b> materials to the concrete mix...|$|E
