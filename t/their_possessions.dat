5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} confiscations {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of <b>their</b> <b>possessions,</b> including Raglan Castle. Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess, decided to prioritise the rebuilding of his other houses at Troy and Badminton, rather than Raglan, reusing some of the property sent away for safety before the war, or salvaged after the slighting.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians {{had arrived in the}} United Kingdom, many of them without <b>their</b> <b>possessions.</b> The refugees had originally been dealt with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{recorded}} named places of Oldham is Hathershaw, occurring in a deed for 1280 with the spelling Halselinechaw Clugh. Existing as a manor in the 15th century, Hathershaw Hall was {{the home of a}} Royalist family in the 17th century who lost part of <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> due to the English Civil War. Waterhead, an upland area in the east of Oldham, traces its roots to a water cornmill over the border in Lees.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising tensions. On his way to Egypt, Napoleon had stopped on Malta and {{forcibly}} removed the Hospitallers from <b>their</b> <b>possessions,</b> angering Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, {{was convinced that the}} Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

5|$|When the Dutch {{transferred}} <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> on the Gold Coast to the British on 6 April 1872, {{the treaty}} of 1656 was still in effect, having regulated political relations between the Dutch and Ahanta for more than 213 years.

5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and <b>their</b> <b>possessions.</b> It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

5|$|At 17 {{he became}} the leader of Glebova's claque, {{was working as a}} copyist for lawyers, and going out to a theater, a tavern, or a party every night. He would later draw on his own life at this time for his {{portrayal}} of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse. Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> and the theft of their money.|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for the prosecution, and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among <b>their</b> <b>possessions.</b> Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E

60|$|The King's half-brothers {{would not}} yield up the castles in <b>their</b> <b>possession,</b> but Montfort told William de Valence {{that he would}} have them, or his head, and brought charges against them before the council, which so alarmed them, that they all fled to Wolvesham Castle, {{belonging}} to Aymar, as intended Bishop of Winchester. Thither the Barons pursued them, and, making them prisoners, sent them out of the realm, with only six thousand marks in <b>their</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 14th century, before the {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, the town of Clare had a population of around 600. The de Clares continued to own estates across England, but in Suffolk <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> were concentrated in estates clustered around Clare Castle. The castle was passed through the de Clare line until Gilbert de Clare died at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when the estate passed onto his sisters. Elizabeth de Clare, whose husband John de Burgh had died the previous year, acquired the castle; the combined estates made Elizabeth one of the wealthiest women in England. Elizabeth used the castle as her main residence between 1322 and 1360.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to Hadley deteriorated {{as he was}} working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July. On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E
5|$|In May 1958, riots {{broke out}} in Sri Lanka between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. Although the Sathyalingams {{received}} a tip-off {{that they had been}} targeted and managed to escape the violence, 80 Sinhalese rioters attacked and burned their home. Having lost their abode and all <b>their</b> <b>possessions,</b> they resettled in Colombo. In 1969 Neila returned to Kalakshetra to be trained as an instructor and to take up a postgraduate diploma course. She graduated in 1972 with a distinction and was appointed a dance teacher with Kalakshetra.|$|E

Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of <b>their</b> <b>possessions,</b> and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.|$|E
5|$|Other {{articles}} {{dealt with}} punishing specific persons, foremost among these, Piers Gaveston. Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} say why these two received particular mention, it could be related to the central position of <b>their</b> <b>possessions</b> in the Scottish war.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising {{tensions}} as well.
