5|$|The {{sight of}} {{elephants}} executing captives both horrified and attracted {{the interest of}} European travelers, and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised {{the region in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six months of operation, the subway was {{operated}} as a single system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} in South India suggest sallekhana {{was originally}} an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain householders.

5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done {{in many parts of the}} world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Marquis {{enrolled}} at University Medical College, Kansas City. A year of study {{was sufficient to}} allow him to practice medicine under the supervision of his father at Bosworth, Missouri, where the pair set up a practice and opened a drugstore. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the supervision of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as a printer in Anaconda. He graduated March23, 1898, and returned to Montana. His daughter, Minnie-Ellen, was born soon after in Anaconda.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} in raising capital for these expansions and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members of}} the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Eastern Han, Emperor Ming passed laws which {{prohibited}} {{those involved in}} agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade. These laws were largely ineffective, since wealthy landowners and landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates. Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 AD), a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government's secretariat, started a winery business in his home {{to pay for his}} father's funeral. His fellow gentry criticized him, claiming <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> immoral, but not illegal.|$|E
5|$|It {{is claimed}} that yoga {{can be an}} {{excellent}} training for children and adolescents, both {{as a form of}} physical exercise and for breathing, focus, mindfulness, and stress relief: many school districts have considered incorporating yoga into their P.E. programs.

5|$|Maple syrup {{was first}} {{collected}} {{and used by}} the indigenous peoples of North America, and <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec {{is by far the}} largest producer, responsible for 70% of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90% of this total. Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about 6% of the global supply.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{believe that}} stichometry became {{established}} in Athens {{sometime during the}} 5th century BCE when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in Plato's Laws (c. 347 BCE), several times in Isocrates (early to mid-4th century), and in Theopompus (late 4th to early 3rd century), but these casual references suggest <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> already routine. The same standard line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as page numbers became more common.|$|E
5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders. The Navy experimented with {{a device to}} transfer coal from colliers to warships while underway in 1907, though <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> not put into general use. Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least , {{more than enough to}} operate in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The {{last heir}} {{apparent}} to the French throne to be crowned during his father's lifetime was the future Philip II, while the only crowned heir apparent to the English throne was Henry the Young King, who was first crowned alone {{and then with}} his wife, Margaret of France. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an heir apparent, {{with the exception of}} investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, was the coronation of the future Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria as junior King of Hungary in 1830.|$|E
5|$|The {{throne of}} Badrinath {{was named after}} the {{presiding}} deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> continued until the late 19th century. During the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued {{as the chairman of}} the management committee.|$|E
5|$|Translations of Falun Gong teachings began {{appearing}} in the late 1990s. Although <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> beginning to attract an overseas constituency, it remained relatively unknown in the Western world until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage. With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China. Following {{the launch of the}} Communist Party's persecution of Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice's resistance in China and its continued survival.|$|E
