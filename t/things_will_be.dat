25|$|Bart D. Ehrman {{argues that}} {{different}} parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. Apocalyptic parts, including the New Testament, see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> set right.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

5000|$|Intensional {{attributes}} can resemble, but are {{not identical}} to, the properties perceived by the five senses. Attributes are names of properties. When, even partially, the properties of a thing match the attributes of that thing {{in the mind of}} the one making the judgment, the <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> said to have [...] "value".

Pinkner has stated that the first six episodes of season one served as a prologue, and that the following episodes, beginning with [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones", would be the [...] "next chapter" [...] in the story. Pinkner further described the episode as [...] "foundational," [...] as it will set up [...] "a lot of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> set up which will come to pay off {{over the next several}} weeks".|$|E
500|$|George and Nico quickly {{arrive at}} the power site, which had been located in Glastonbury, as bad storms across the world begin to strike; the town is badly flooded when they reach the area. As Nico confronts Petra, George tries to stop the Grand Master, {{arriving}} {{in time to see}} the Grand Master absorb the energy at the site, turning him into a dragon and causing the ground beneath them to collapse. George finds a sword in the cavern he lands in, which he uses to slay the dragon and save the world. [...] As Nico arrives to congratulate him, Petra dying from the dragon's death, George tosses the sword into the floodwaters, as the pair wonder how <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in the future.|$|E
500|$|They quickly {{find the}} pirates, who are shocked {{that anyone would}} knowingly venture into their base. The pirates decide to ransom the boys to the first European vessel they find. The boys {{confidently}} go with them, believing they are being taken to a pirate ship, but are once again disappointed when they are taken to a small motorboat. Eventually, the pirates find a French schooner and demand a ransom of five thousand euros {{in exchange for the}} boys' lives. Meanwhile in South Park, Kyle happily claims partial credit for sending Cartman to Somalia and expects <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> better without Cartman around. But when his parents discover a farewell letter from Ike, Kyle realizes his brother has run off with Cartman to Somalia, and he sets off for Mogadishu to bring his brother home. Back in Somalia, the ransom is paid and the boys are surrendered. Once on board, however, Cartman assumes control of the schooner and orders the crew to get onto the lifeboat. Although the captain initially refuses, Kevin brandishes a toy lightsaber, frightening the French crew into abandoning ship. Cartman and the boys return to Mogadishu with the captured vessel, giving several bundles of Euros to the pirates. The pirates are initially shocked, but begin to respect Cartman. Unimpressed by their lack of [...] "pirate" [...] traits, he in turn leads them in raiding ships via a traditional sea shanty called [...] "Somalian Pirates, We", and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical pirate crew.|$|E

500|$|Under Section 30(2), {{fair dealing}} using any {{work for the}} purpose of {{reporting}} current events, with sufficient acknowledgement, is a valid exception to copyright. Photographs are excluded, however; Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin write that this is [...] "in order to preserve the full value of holding a unique visual record of some person or event". A crucial element of the [...] "current events" [...] exception {{is whether or not the}} reporting covers [...] "current" [...] events. [...] "The older the issue, the less likely it is that it will be treated as having any currency". Hyde Park confirmed that, where an event that took place some time ago is still being discussed, that can be treated as [...] "current". The nature of [...] "events" [...] must also be confirmed; while some <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> inherently considered events, such as matters of national importance, major sporting contests or important political occasions, others may not be. Matters that are [...] "trivial, ephemeral or immaterial" [...] may not be treated as events, although it has been confirmed that media attention can transform a trivial matter into an [...] "event", as in Pro Sieben. The copyrighted works must also directly deal with the current events; Associated Newspapers v News Group Newspapers, for example, concerned the republication of correspondence between Wallis Simpson and her husband on the occasion of Simpson's death. It was held that the correspondence did not relate closely enough to the death for the fair dealing exception to apply.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Spain {{suffered}} from the economic consequences of its isolation from the international community. This situation ended in part when, due to Spain's strategic location in light of Cold War tensions, the United States entered into a trade and military alliance with Spain {{as part of its}} policy of containment. This historic alliance commenced with the signing of the Pact of Madrid in 1953. Spain was then admitted to the United Nations in 1955. American poet James Wright wrote of Eisenhower's visit: [...] "Franco stands in a shining circle of police. / His arms open in welcome. / He promises all dark <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> hunted down." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – Qatar was {{reported}} to be unhappy over the move after it spent about US$10 billion in financial aid towards the Morsi government; while they were said to also be unhappy about the closure of Al Jazeeras offices in Cairo. Yet the new emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, sent [...] "a cable of congratulations" [...] to the new interim president. The Foreign Ministry released a statement that read: [...] "Qatar will continue to respect the will of Egypt and its people across the spectrum." [...] After a month of protests and international mediation efforts, Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiya said that he {{had not been able to}} meet all those he was promised he could meet and that [...] "my wish for the brothers in Egypt is to release the political prisoners as soon as possible because they are the key to unlocking this crisis.

2500|$|If {{there is}} any word which might serve {{as a key to}} the {{philosophical}} and practical aims of Þeyr it is [...] "symmetry". They combine their belief in an inherent structure behind the manifestation of matter with intense experimental fervour that aims at unravelling at least a few practical applications of this [...] "divine proportion" [...] that determines the extent and amplitude of our aesthetic experience [...] The second study deals with the harmonic build up of music, and this has led to a study of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) whose work aimed at breaking up all classical rules of harmonic composition and ultimately at the founding of a new music that would escape the straitjacket of the 12-tone scale [...] He further sought to unite sensations such as smell, sight and hearing into one, and some of his later works were interpreted in colour as well as sound. This fascinating study is being pursued by Þeyr whose concerts have been known to reek of exotic incense and to be lighted by a certain blending of root colours. Ultimately these <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> married under the one heading which forms their third study, FOURIER. The Fourier as they jokingly refer to it is basically a machine that is being worked upon by one of the bands members who has a background in theoretical mathematics, physics and electrical engineering. However it has through time of construction (several proto-types of its main parts have already been constructed and some already discarded in favour of new ideas currently being worked on) come to represent an entirely new approach to the basic laws which underlie natural structures as ranging from the formation of crystals to harmonic scales that can be worked out of logarythmic spirals, these building in the scales 12. 17, 31, 55...n. making use of the basic laws and axioms supplied by the French mathematician and physicist J. B. Fourier. He {{has come up with a}} machine that makes use of the newest advances in computer technology but is controlled through a simple set of symbols which are ultimately part of the Fourier philosophy (as they jokingly refer to it) that is slowly but steadily being constructed by the band. The future user of the Fourier will need and extensive background in the writings of such diverse personalities as R. Buckminster Fuller, Giordano Bruno, the alchemical writings of Newton, not to mention Nyquist, Walsh and others which have worked upon the mathematics of music. See also under Life Transmission for their earlier explanation.|$|E
