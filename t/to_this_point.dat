5|$|The road existed prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> as a {{northern}} development road. However, on April1, 1937, the DND merged into the DHO. As a result, numerous highways were assumed {{in the northern}} regions of Ontario in mid-1937.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of {{the proximity of the}} enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|Belgian Eddy Merckx was the {{dominant}} figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968; another triumph in 1970 {{was followed by}} three successive victories from 1972 to 1974, which is {{the record for the}} most successive victories in the Giro. Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> had won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964.

5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in the season: he threw three interceptions and {{was held to}} only 84 yards rushing.

The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game {{in front of his}} home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} dropped for the ODI series, playing {{in only one}} match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs. However, he did manage to post his first ODI half-century, scoring 64, defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213, sealing a 106-run loss. Greg Chappell became {{the coach of the}} Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder.
