5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> for {{shooting}} the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount}} of work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E

40|$|Using micro {{data from}} the Austrian Labor Force Survey, this paper explores how {{decreases}} in the gender differential in participation rates together with increasing differentials {{in the incidence of}} part-time jobs and stable or rising levels of occupational segregation by gender affect <b>the</b> gender <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor.</b> To so so, we propose an index for <b>the</b> gender <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> based on <b>the</b> Mutual Information index. Our main results show that <b>the</b> gender <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> is very stable along the 16 -year period.

In the model above, relationships were explored between perceived fairness and twenty independent variables. The data are based on a survey administered to 600 employed wives from three different kinds of workplaces in Bangkok, Thailand: Government sector (n= 214), quasi-government sector (n= 191) and private sector (n= 195). Employed wives were recruited by purposive sampling from each workplace. In addition qualitative interviews were used with a convenience sample of 30 employed wives selected by purposive sampling from the large sample of 600. The interview data suggest explanations for wives' perceived fairness in <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care. Stepwise multiple regression was used to develop {{a model of the}} determinants predicting wives' perceived fairness in <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care. Findings are that perceived fairness was positively correlated with feeling appreciated, marital happiness, within-gender comparisons, spending time together, work hours/day, family harmony, and wife's ascription to traditional women's roles; but was negatively correlated with wife's value of housework and men's incompetence at housework. The results of the stepwise multiple regression on perceived fairness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> indicated that only 9 of 20 independent variables (predictors) enter the regression model at the. 05 level of significance or above, accounting for 32...|$|R

25|$|In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen writes {{critically}} of {{conspicuous consumption}} and its function in social-class consumerism and social stratification. Reflecting historically, he traces said economic behaviors {{back to the}} beginnings of <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor,</b> or during tribal times. Upon {{the start of a}} division of labor, high-status individuals within the community practiced hunting and war, notably less labor-intensive and less economically productive work. Low-status individuals, on the other hand, practiced activities recognized as more economically productive and more labor-intensive, such as farming and cooking. High-status individuals, as Veblen explains, could instead afford to live their lives leisurely (hence their title as the leisure class), engaging in symbolic economic participation, rather than practical economic participation. These individuals could engage in conspicuous leisure for extended periods of time, simply following pursuits that evoked a higher social status. Rather than participating in conspicuous consumption, the leisure class lived lives of conspicuous leisure as a marker of high status. The leisure class protected and reproduced their social status and control within the tribe through, for example, their participation in war-time activities, which while they were rarely needed, still rendered their lower social class counterparts dependent upon them. During modern industrial times, Veblen described the leisure class as those exempt from industrial labor. Instead, he explains, the leisure class participated in intellectual or artistic endeavors to display their freedom from the economic need to participate in economically productive manual labor. In essence, not having to perform labor-intensive activities did not mark higher social status, but rather, higher social status meant that one would not have to perform such duties.|$|E
500|$|Feminist economists also examine early {{economic}} thinkers' interaction or lack {{of interaction}} with gender and women's issues, showing examples of women's historical engagement with economic thought.

She finds that through his writings, Smith typically supported the status quo on women's issues and [...] "lost sight of <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> in the family and the contribution of women's economic work." [...] In response, she points to Mary Collier's works such as The Woman's Labour (1739) to help understand Smith's contemporaneous experiences of women and fill in such gaps.|$|E
