The voters of Columbus were considering a referendum {{to build a}} publicly financed arena, a major step toward approval of their NHL bid. When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus {{to meet with the}} community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern that the voters might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman {{that they would not be}} willing <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.|$|E
500|$|On 2 December 2005, {{tensions}} between King's and the London School of Economics (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in Aldwych near the Strand Campus) diverted {{off from the}} annual [...] "barrel run" [...] and caused an estimated £32,000 of damage to the English department at King's. The Times reported that LSE director Howard Davies attended the fun run event, while LSE claimed that Davies only attended for a short time. King's principal, Sir Rick Trainor, deplored the behaviour, appealed to King's students to remain calm and called for no retaliation. The LSE Students' Union later on 6 December issued a formal apology, condemned the actions, as well as promising <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the damage repair.|$|E
500|$|A {{measure of}} the upset he caused to the Dutch {{authorities}} can be gauged by {{the contents of a}} letter from VOC Governor-General Anthony van Diemen to VOC headquarters in Amsterdam in 1636, expressing his concern about plans to send a highly paid lawyer to Batavia to draw up a legal code: [...] Nuyts was held under house arrest by the Japanese from 1632 until 1636, when he was released and sent back to Batavia. During this period he passed the time by mining his collection of classical Latin texts by writers such as Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus to write treatises on subjects such as the elephant and the Nile Delta, exercises which were designed to display rhetorical flair and high style. He also further annoyed Dutch authorities by spending lavish sums on clothing and food, things for which the VOC had <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{committees}} in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining {{funds for the}} construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and {{of the fact that the}} gift required Americans <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. Harper's Weekly declared its wish that [...] "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances." [...] Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Keith Meatto of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as [...] "a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss, life and death, humanity and divinity". Entertainment.ie's Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as [...] "a strange one, that's for sure, {{but he may}} just be a genius". Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either [...] "one {{of the most important}} songwriters of his generation" [...] or [...] "just an infuriating, neurotic show-off". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album [...] "goes a bit barmy and over-the-top" [...] there are some [...] "incredible tune" [...] that are [...] "not only genuinely remarkable, but genuinely enjoyable". Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album [...] "conjures just enough moments of heart-stopping gorgeousness <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for its dizzying excesses". Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point: that the album is [...] "suffused with individual moments of brilliance", but overall it is [...] "let down by its self-conscious incoherence".|$|E

In the next box was the King, who from accounts {{was more interested in}} flirting with Nell than watching the play. Charles invited Nell and her escort (a Mr. Villiers, a cousin of Buckingham's) to supper, along with his brother the Duke of York. The anecdote turns charming if perhaps apocryphal at this point: the King, after supper, discovered that he had no money on him; nor did his brother, and Gwyn had <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> [...] "Od's fish!"

2500|$|Eleven {{days before}} the {{scheduled}} walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. [...] Official permits {{had not yet been}} granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. [...] Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. [...] The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. [...] To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> [...] Permits were issued the next day. [...] However, two {{days before the}} event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, [...] "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." [...] However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were [...] "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. [...] Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.|$|E
2500|$|That {{dispersion}} of power, though seen by many, then and later, {{as a major}} weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the [...] "True Freedom"). We have already seen that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. [...] "True Freedom" [...] implied the rejection of an [...] "eminent head", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, and they looked askance at such designs by the other provinces, because they knew they were likely to have <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation.|$|E

50|$|By {{the second}} half of 1950 the western powers were caught up in a major {{rearmament}} drive. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 at first threatened US loss of South Korea (which was seen as vital for the defence of Japan), and by the autumn threatened to escalate into a general war between the USA and Communist China. There were also very real worries that the Soviets might invade western Europe (which was unarmed, with strong communist influence in many countries) and that the USA would not help Britain if she did not help herself. The crushing of democracy in Czechoslovakia had been as recent as 1948.

50|$|What brought Brown to the {{forefront}} of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown. Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S.

Hasting brought Brown and Edison together and was in continual contact with Brown. Edison Electric seemed <b>to</b> be <b>footing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for some of Browns publications on the dangers of AC and Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of Scranton, Pennsylvania, recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC. Some of this collusion would be exposed in letters stolen from Brown's office and published in August 1889.|$|R

His goal was to provide a rigorous classical education to minority students and the less fortunate, heavy on history, English, and writing; Merrill himself taught Bible class to the entire class of ninth graders, not from a religious perspective but from a humanistic one. He also maintained the principles of Yankee frugality, requiring students to participate in the upkeep of the school, from bussing tables and washing dishes at lunch to emptying trash baskets {{at the end of the}} day.

It was reported in 2015 that the Nigeria Police Force, Railway Command in Lagos State, arrested 58 out of about 200 sighted suspected hoodlums in just one evening around 8  pm for riding on the rooftop of moving trains [18, 19]. Again, 105 rooftop riders were arrested in November 2016 out of which 36 were arraigned in court [21]. Many times, the rooftop riders resist arrest and even fight back. For instance, Aderibigbe [22] reported that in an attempt to resist arrest in the Agege area of Lagos in November 2016, rooftop riders unleashed mayhem as the train approached, throwing stones and other objects at the police officers. In the process, a baby strapped to her mother’s back was hit on the head and died the following morning. Irate Agege youths stormed the station, destroying properties of NRC and demanding a stop of train services until rooftop riding was eradicated.

50|$|WrestleMania VII was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but the WWF decided to move the event to the adjacent Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The WWF's stated reason for the venue change was that it had security concerns in the wake of Sgt. Slaughter's portrayal of an Iraqi sympathizer during the Gulf War. This was dismissed by outlets such as SLAM! Sports of Canada, who chalked up the venue change to poor advanced ticket sales, and the company having difficulty filling the estimated 100,000 seats available. According to former WWF executive Bruce Prichard, both were accurate statements. In his podcast, Something to Wrestle With, Prichard said that even if the WWF had sold out the Coliseum the scope of the event was too large for police to ensure its security.
