5000|$|A kuliglig is {{a vehicle}} {{composed}} of a two-wheeled trailer pulled by a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> similar to a rotary tiller. It is powered by multi-purpose diesel or gasoline engine, commonly used in the provinces of the Philippines. The kuliglig traces its etymology from the Filipino term kuliglig, meaning [...] "cicada" [...] (a type of insect) which was adopted by one manufacturer as a brand.|$|E
50|$|The LeTourneau name became {{synonymous with}} {{earthmoving}} worldwide. LeTourneau was {{largely responsible for}} the invention and development of many types of earthmoving machines now widely used. He designed and built machines using technology that was years, sometimes decades, ahead of its time and became recognized worldwide as a leader in the development and manufacture of heavy equipment. The use of rubber tires in earthmoving; numerous improvements relating to scrapers; the development of low-pressure, heavy-duty rubber tires; the <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> unit ("Tournapull"); electric wheel drive, and mobile offshore drilling platforms, are all attributed to LeTourneau’s ingenuity.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1911, Benjamin Franklin Gravely of Charleston West Virginia began with {{connecting}} the Indian motorcycle to a manually operated push plow. In 1916 he incorporated and, after obtaining partners, began producing single-wheel tractors and attachments {{under the name}} Gravely Tractor. The Model [...] "D" [...] Gravely Power Plow, like the prototype, was a single-wheeled affair, with a [...] air-cooled engine. It wasn't until 1937 that Gravely would introduce the Model L <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with a [...] engine. Through the 20th century, Gravely became arguably {{one of the most}} successful and recognizable two-weeled tractors produced in the United States, at one point offering 120 individual attachments for their all-gear drive machines.|$|E
50|$|Simplicity Manufacturing Company is an American {{company based}} in Port Washington, Wisconsin that builds lawn and garden {{equipment}} under various brands. The company was founded by William J. Niederkorn in 1922, and started building walk-behind <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractors</b> in 1939. Between 1941 and 1945, due to World War II, Simplicity Manufacturing temporarily halted production of lawn and garden products, and manufactured electric fence controllers and external surface grinders to satisfy the War Production Board. Simplicity built is first riding tractor in 1957 which was the model Wonderboy. Allis-Chalmers purchased the company in 1965, and Simplicity's management bought it back in 1983. Simplicity Manufacturing celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1997 with a special 75th anniversary tractor model. The tractor featured a special blue paint scheme with chrome Harley-Davidson lights and muffler.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, Wijewardene {{designed}} a <b>two-wheeled,</b> walking <b>tractor</b> to help small {{farmers in the}} tropics to mechanise their work. An early attempt to mechanize farm labour during the Green Revolution, it was manufactured and marketed worldwide by the Landmaster company in Nottingham, UK. Having promoted the tractor with farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America for a decade, Wijewardene later questioned its value addition to poor farmers cultivating small holdings in the developing world.|$|R
40|$|Labour and labour {{conditions}} in Dutch forestry and in management of Dutch wildlife areas are studied by literature review, evaluation of workplaces and questionnaires. In the Netherlands, very few statistics are available about labour and absence through illness in forestry {{and management of}} wildlife areas. In this study, mainly based on data concerning the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, {{it is estimated that}} about 3867 people work in these sectors, and this number will probably rise. Absence trough illness was about 7 %; this was more than the Dutch overall average of 5. 5 %. The most important reasons for sick leave were pain in the back or in the limbs, due to frequent lifting, lugging, pushing, pulling and exposure to vibrations. Cutting or pruning trees using chain saws and mowing using <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractors</b> or portable mowers were activities causing the most physical load. Forestry is known to be a dangerous sector compared to others, but national statistics concerning accidents are not available. Hygiene is amore important topic than in most other sectors, since often no sanitary facilities are available. Lyme-disease, caused by ticks, is a typical occupational disease in this sector. Also the mental load of workers in this sector is substantial. Forest workers have to observe many rules and laws, and have to deal with involvement of the general public and public opinion. Also workers in wildlife areas have to be good at handling the general public and public opinion, but additionally have to deal with changing objectives of the organization they work for. Beside of the traditional nature protecting tasks, they now also have to educate the visitors. Staatsbosbeheer and other organizations watching over forest or wildlife areas have taken initiatives to improve {{labour conditions}} for their employees. Initiatives, which are usable for others, are entered in the recommendations of this study...|$|R
50|$|Two-wheel tractor {{or walking}} tractor motoculteur Einachsschlepper oder Bodenfräse are generic terms {{understood}} in the USA and in parts of Europe to represent a single-axle tractor, which is a tractor with one axle, self-powered and self-propelled, which can pull and power various farm implements such as a trailer, cultivator or harrow, a plough, or various seeders and harvesters. The operator usually walks behind it or rides the implement being towed. Similar terms are mistakenly applied to the household rotary tiller or power tiller; although these may be wheeled and/or self-propelled, they are not tailored for towing implements. A <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> specializes in pulling any of numerous types of implements, whereas rotary tillers specialize in soil tillage with their dedicated digging tools. This article concerns two-wheeled tractors as distinguished from such tillers.|$|E
40|$|Comparative Study of Four Traction Power Levels for Seed Bed Preparation in Small-scale Vegetable Production. The {{effects of}} four {{different}} traction power categories on soil structure {{was measured in}} the field during seed bed preparation experiments in a sandy clay soil and a clayish sand soil used for vegetable production. The power categories investigated corresponded to a standard tractor of 59 kW, a medium power tractor of 33 kW, a low power tractor of 22 kW and a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> of 6 kW. In each experiment, seed bed preparation was carried out using a mouldboard plough and a rotary cultivator, respectively. Soil structure was characterised by measuring the resistance against vertical penetration of a cone {{by means of a}} penetrometer and the apparent dry density by means of a cylindrical densimeter. For both soils, the results showed a porous soil state without any significant difference among the four power levels. All different methods of tillage used were giving the same structure in the top layer. The soil crumbling was done using a PTO driven cultivator. Also, the measured parameters did not differ significantly over the depth of the worked area. Also the differences in work speed and equipment used don't have any influences on the measured parameters. The complexity asks for a detailed technical-economical investigation in order to define {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of small power mechanisation for seed bed preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{strategic}} {{roles of}} agriculture are provider {{of food and}} raw material for the industry, as well as contributor of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), foreign exchange earnings, and the main employer. Based on the total GRDP of agriculture, food crops have the highest value compared to other subsectors. However, {{when compared to other}} sectors, the the total GRDP of the agricultural sector inin East Java is still lower than that of the manufacturing and trade sectors. To increase its contribution,  agricultural sector needs policies, regulations, programs and specific intervention for food crops performance in each district. The objectives of the study were to analyze factors affecting the GRDP of food crops sub-sector in East Java, and to analyze the efficiency level of the food crop sub-sector in the districts/cities in East Java. The research method was the Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Front 4. 1 application. The dependent variable was GRDP of  food crops, and the independent variables consist of irrigated land, dry land area, the number of agricultural labors, the number of subsidized fertilizer, the subsidized of two-wheel tractors, and water pump. Based on the survey, the factors that significantly influence the GDP were irrigated land area, dry land area, number of employees, and subsidized <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>tractors.</b> The findings suggested that the area of irrigated land, dry land, the number of labor, and the subsidized two-wheel tractor had significant effect towards the GRDP of the food crops sub-sector. However, the amount of subsidized fertilizer and water pump assistance did not significantly affect the GRDP of the food crops sub-sector. The average efficiency level of the food crops sub-sector in East Java was 0. 77 with a minimum efficiency of 0. 44 in Mojokerto City and the maximum efficiency in Gresik was  0. 96. The central regions of the food crop sub-sector had an average of high efficiency, while the low-efficiency regions were the urban areas...|$|R
40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a <b>two-wheeled</b> winch <b>tractor</b> on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a winch tractor, a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the winch drum on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the winch drum. The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its winch drum the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the winch tractor permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.

5000|$|The Allis 6-12 {{entered the}} market {{at a time when}} the {{mechanization}} of agriculture was underway but was far from complete. Tractors had not yet managed to completely replace the horse team for all farm tasks. The product category of row-crop tractors as we know them today had not yet been developed, and the Allis 6-12 had a very attractive value proposition. Unfortunately that proposition was also suspiciously similar to that of the Moline Universal tractor, which had been on the market for about 2 years before the Allis 6-12 appeared. Moline Plow considered the Allis 6-12 a patent-infringing copy. The late 1910s were a period when various <b>two-wheeled</b> and three-wheeled <b>tractors</b> were on the U.S. market. Moline Plow had by no means invented such configurations. However, the Allis 6-12 was especially similar to the Moline Universal, lending credibility to Moline Plow's assertion that it was a copy.|$|R
