2500|$|In September 2007, Emin {{announced}} {{she would be}} exhibiting new sculpture work in the inaugural Folkestone Triennial {{which took place in}} the Kent town from June until September 2008. In June 2008 Emin discussed the Folkestone sculptures, stating the [...] "high percentage" [...] of teenage pregnancies in the Kent town had inspired this latest work. Emin said her contribution would be different pieces placed around the town, [...] "I'm going to be making very tiny bronze-cast items of baby clothing. It's baby clothes that I have found in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>like</b> a mitten or a sock." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sheaffe {{decided that}} the battle was lost and ordered the regulars to retreat, setting fire to the wooden bridge over the River Don east of the town to thwart pursuit. The militia and several {{prominent}} citizens were left [...] "standing in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a parcel of sheep". Sheaffe instructed the militia {{to make the best}} terms they could with the Americans, but without informing the senior militia officers or any official of the legislature, he also dispatched Captain Tito LeLièvre of the Royal Newfoundland to set fire to the sloop of war [...] under construction in the dockyard, and to blow up the fort's magazine.|$|E
6000|$|HOXTON. [Recovering his feet.] Wrong? Great Scott! Constable! Why do you {{let things}} lie about in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> this? Look here, Wellyn! ...|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. That's right. I can't {{carry the}} girl through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> a {{blooming}} monkey, can I? I {{put it to}} you.|$|R
25|$|Many non-Clique {{individuals}} and small groups known as Schyssdräggziigli also wander through <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Cliques, they play music with piccolos and drums.|$|R
50|$|George {{is reduced}} to his {{underwear}} by the bad guys and complains he cannot walk around <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> that as he'll be mistaken for Gandhi.|$|R
60|$|We made a breakfast, {{never to}} be forgotten; paid our bill with a flourish, and sallied into <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>like</b> two goodly galleons of gold, bound from Acapulco to Old Spain.|$|E
6000|$|Bertram's countenance fell. [...] "And if I'm seen in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] he asked, [...] "will they do {{anything}} to me? Will the guardians of the peace--the police, I mean--arrest me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's Uncle Sweeney, an' that settles it; spring's comin' sure!" [...] said Troutt, {{pointing}} {{at an old}} man much bent, hobbling down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a symbolic figure of the old year.|$|E
5000|$|Clive Mantle - Bobby a {{physically}} large neighborhood bully {{who was arrested}} by Rebecca a week prior for brawling in <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>likes</b> bragging about fighting ...|$|R
60|$|The way seemed interminable, and <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> black web of some {{sprawling}} spider. The monotony became unbearable, and, as {{the mist}} thickened, he felt afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} in his favour. I dislike him particularly. For {{anything}} I know he {{may have}} sold pencils about <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> any other Jew-boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{others were}} about to follow, when a shrill [...] "Hi, hi, boys, hold on!" [...] made them turn about to behold Billy Barton tearing down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a runaway colt, waving a long strip of paper as he ran.|$|E
6000|$|... “Spread yourselves, men,” he cried, as {{he passed}} the ladies, his heavy feet {{sounding}} along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> the tread of a dozen; “spread yourselves; to the mountains; they’ll be in the mountains in {{a quarter of an}} hour, and then look out for a long rifle.” ...|$|E
60|$|He couldn't {{enjoy the}} play at all, 'e was so upset, {{and he began}} to see more than ever 'ow wrong he 'ad been in taking Bob's gal away from 'im. He walked downstairs into <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a man in a dream, with Gerty {{sticking}} to 'is arm and young Ted treading on 'is heels behind.|$|E
6000|$|And you, {{are their}} father? Now, why don't {{you keep your}} little girls at home. How is it you leave them to wander about <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> this? ...|$|R
6000|$|One day M. Myriel was in Paris. This angel {{used to walk}} about <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> {{any other}} man. He was not proud, though fine-looking. Well, three gamins de Paris called him bad names. Says one,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} go! I tell you what. I'll come, too.... Why! There's your leg, old man! Clean forgot it! You can't go through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> that. I'll sew up the tear. And {{meanwhile}} have another whiskey." ...|$|R
60|$|Taken {{completely}} by surprise, bewildered by the suddenness and {{fury of the}} onslaught, appalled by the terrific war yells, smitten down by the rain of missiles from the Aztecs, the Spaniards fell into confusion, and were swept down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> foam {{on the crest of}} a wave. In vain their leaders attempted to rally them. Their voices were drowned in the din, and their followers, panic stricken, now thought only of preserving their lives.|$|E
60|$|The {{lawyer and}} the hotel-keeper retired first. Owen, {{gathering}} {{up as much}} of his sister's clothing as lay about the room, took her upon his arm, and followed them. Edward, to whom she owed everything, who had been left standing in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a dog without a home, was utterly forgotten. Owen paid the landlord and {{the lawyer for the}} trouble he had occasioned them, looked to the packing, and went to the door.|$|E
60|$|To a {{young fellow}} of Arthur's temperament, {{the novelty of}} being turned away into <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a penniless vagabond, at every house where {{he asked for a}} lodging, {{presented}} itself in the light of a new and highly amusing piece of experience. He went on with his carpet-bag in his hand, applying for a bed at every place of entertainment for travelers that he could find in Doncaster, until he wandered into the outskirts of the town.|$|E
6000|$|The weavers {{make the}} clothes of men [...] And coats for everyone; [...] They walk <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> sunset clouds; [...] But we have woven and spun [...] In scarlet or in golden-green [...] The gay coats of the sun.|$|R
50|$|Iranian {{opposition}} leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, {{as well as}} commentators asserted that the Iranian regime has stepped up executions {{in a bid to}} intimidate and silence the Iranian opposition from taking to <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> 2009-2010 Iranian election protests.|$|R
6000|$|Teddy, {{plunged into}} a very [...] "Slough of Despond," [...] was {{suffering}} himself to be taken through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> a criminal, when he was startled by hearing a hoarse whisper directly behind him; {{at the same instant}} his hand was grasped by another.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aha! Now you'll catch it,' I said, as the herald gusts set the big drum {{rolling down}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a box-kite. Up and up yearned the dark cloud, till the first {{lightning}} quivered and cut. Deborah cowered. Where she flew, there she fled; where she was, there she sat still; and the solid rain {{closed in on}} her as a book that is closed when the chapter is finished. By the time it had soaked to my second rug, Penfentenyou appeared at the window, wiping his false mouth on a napkin.|$|E
60|$|With Mary, {{procedure}} was always plain sailing. Either {{she was in}} love and wanted to marry, or she wasn't. Her ideals changed comparatively little, and were healthily commonplace. Her friendships were quick, warm and stable. She was the country girl in the city, and would be so until death. If she felt disposed, she chewed gum or ate an apple on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a boy, and she walked on the Lake Shore Sunday evening with Owen, unconscious (and uncaring) of the servant-girls and their lovers seated on every bench.|$|E
60|$|But {{he could}} not linger forever over a glass of ice-cream soda, while he did not dare ask for a second glass. So he left her {{to remain in the}} shop in a waking trance, and went away himself down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a somnambulist. Genevieve dreamed through the {{afternoon}} and knew that she was in love. Not so with Joe. He knew only that he wanted to look at her again, to see her face. His thoughts did not get beyond this, and besides, it was scarcely a thought, being more a dim and inarticulate desire.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970 novel The Chinese Agent {{by author}} Michael Moorcock, a world-renowned jewel-thief more than meets his match when he {{attempts}} to swipe a brooch from a Portobello Road market stall, and is hunted down through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> a dog by the sharp-eyed market traders.|$|R
50|$|Around one {{thousand}} performance artists called 1000 Gestalten covered themselves in grey pigment and slowly walked through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> zombies. This performance {{was done to}} draw awareness of political apathy. After walking, they all removed their grey clothes. Underneath were colourful clothes that symbolized becoming engaged and awake.|$|R
60|$|So {{the days}} went on, each day {{lessening}} {{the number of}} the inhabitants of the town. Fever and famine were making terrible ravages, and the survivors moved about <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> living skeletons, so feeble and weak, now, that they could scarce bear the weight of their arms.|$|R
60|$|Upon that {{establishment}} of state, the Merdle establishment in Harley Street, Cavendish Square, {{there was the}} shadow of no more common wall than the fronts of other establishments of state {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>Like</b> unexceptionable Society, the opposing rows of houses in Harley Street were very grim with one another. Indeed, the mansions and their inhabitants were so much alike in that respect, that the people were often to be found drawn up on opposite sides of dinner-tables, in the shade of their own loftiness, staring at the other side of the way with the dullness of the houses.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a bright}} {{intelligent}} little street-Arab {{on the opposite side}} of the way, who observed Giles with mingled feelings of admiration, envy, and hatred, as he strode sedately along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> an imperturbable pillar. He knew Number 666 personally; had seen him under many and varied circumstance, and had imagined him under many others-- not unfrequently as hanging by the neck from a lamp-post--but never, even in the most daring flights of his juvenile fancy, had he seen him as he has been seen by the reader in the bosom of his poor but happy home.|$|E
60|$|But it was better, {{grim and}} sombre in the shade, than when, the day being more advanced, it stood confessed {{in the full}} glare and glory of the sun, with its black paint blistering, and its nooses {{dangling}} in the light like loathsome garlands. It was better in the solitude and gloom of midnight with a few forms clustering about it, than in the freshness and the stir of morning: the centre of an eager crowd. It was better haunting <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>like</b> a spectre, when men were in their beds, and influencing perchance the city's dreams, than braving the broad day, and thrusting its obscene presence upon their waking senses.|$|E
60|$|To make a {{story from}} Robert Raikes seeing dirty {{children}} at play, in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of London, and inquiring of a woman about them. She tells him that on Sundays, {{when they were not}} employed, they were a great deal worse, making <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> hell; playing at church, etc. He was therefore induced to employ women at a shilling to teach them on Sundays, and thus Sunday schools were established.|$|R
5000|$|... 20th Century Fox Film Noir {{refers to}} a {{collection}} of films released on DVD by 20th Century Fox. The series, a spinoff of the earlier Fox Studio Classics line, was premiered in March 2005, {{with the release of}} the inaugural titles Call Northside 777, Laura and Panic in <b>the</b> <b>Streets.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> earlier Studio Classics line, Fox Film Noir DVDs are numbered on their spines.|$|R
5000|$|Billboard gave Red Umbrella a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It's {{a positive}} love song that is uplifting and sweet, but doesn't venture too far into saccharine territory. And just when you'd think the world's songwriters might {{have run out}} of new ways to describe love, here's a fresh analogy: 'Your love is like a red umbrella/Walk <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>like</b> Cinderella/Everyone can see it on my face.' Hill's performance is perfection." ...|$|R
