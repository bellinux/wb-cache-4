5|$|By {{the time}} the series started {{broadcasting}} on ATV in September 1967, principal photography had been completed for the first 20 episodes. In general, turnaround for completing all the puppet shots for each episode was <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> 11 working days. It was originally predicted that shooting would be wrapped within eight months, but filming overran until late October due {{to the demands of}} the Thunderbird 6 shoot. While production on the next Supermarionation series, , began in November it was not until early 1968 that the last episodes of Captain Scarlet were edited and completed for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

25|$|The microfilariae {{circulate}} in {{the bloodstream}} {{for as long as}} two years, waiting for the next stage in their lifecycles in the gut of a bloodsucking mosquito. When ingested by a mosquito, the microfilariae undergo a series of molts to the infective third larval stage, and then migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito, where they wait to infect another host. The incubation period required to reach the stage where the microfilariae become transmittable to another host can be as little as <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> as long as six weeks, depending on the warmth of the climate, and the larval lifecycle ceases entirely if the ambient temperature drops below 14°C (57°F).|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} usually laid in March and April. The adult female will lay {{up to five}} masses of eggs which contain 2 to 250 eggs each. The eggs are {{deposited}} {{at the base of}} the dwarf plantain plant or less frequently the owl's clover or paintbrush. The eggs take about ten days to hatch and upon emergence from the eggs the larvae grow for a period of <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> more during which they shed their skin until they reach their fourth instar. Any larvae that successfully enters the fourth instar enter a period of diapause that lasts through the entire summer. During diapause they spend time under rocks or within cracks in the soil. When the diapause ends they resume activity, feeding and move to complete their development into adult Bay checkerspot butterflies.|$|E
25|$|On the downside, {{cartridges}} {{took longer}} to manufacture than CDs, with each production run (from order to delivery) taking <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> more. This meant that publishers of Nintendo 64 games had {{to attempt to}} predict demand for a game ahead of its release. They risked being left with a surplus of expensive cartridges for a failed game or a weeks-long shortage of product if they underestimated a game's popularity. The cost of producing a Nintendo 64 cartridge was also far higher than for a CD. Publishers passed these expenses onto the consumer. Nintendo 64 games cost an average of $10 more when compared to games produced for rival consoles. The higher cost also created the potential for much greater losses to the game's publisher {{in the case of}} a flop, making the less risky CD medium tempting for third party companies.|$|E

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E
500|$|It {{was a time}} of {{problems}} and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> so, according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were [...] "outrageous emotional interventions" [...] {{in order to make the}} group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine's creative control over a [...] "successful formula", so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona. The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios (Tempe) in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May- this studio is often the location for scenes in the Evolver video.|$|E
500|$|Females perform most of {{the care}} of eggs and nestlings, though males take a minor share of {{incubation}} and brooding. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring [...] and with red-brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. The female incubates the eggs for 30days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For the first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> so the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. The female does no hunting at all {{for the first three}} weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week or two, at which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36days, and the post-fledging period at least 36days with parental feeding for at least 22days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks' wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own.|$|E
