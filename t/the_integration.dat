40|$|In the {{calculation}} of cross sections for infrared-safe observables in high energy collisions at next-to-leading order, one approach is to perform all of <b>the</b> <b>integrations,</b> including <b>the</b> virtual loop <b>integration</b> numerically.

The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>integration</b> of the mitochondria, {{the product of an}} endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{in applied}} ethics is a {{descriptive}} ethical analysis of <b>the</b> current <b>integration</b> policy in <b>the</b> Netherlands. The main {{purpose is to}} describe and critically discuss <b>the</b> Dutch <b>integration</b> policy.

This thesis contributes with a characterization of <b>integration</b> by <b>the</b> United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, European Commission and within the Dutch context, particularly a characterization of values and ideals in integration policies. Also, an attempt is made to analyze what the underlying motives and core values are, and which values should be fostered. Moreover, an overview is given of the various dimensions of <b>integration.</b> <b>The</b> second part of this thesis explores <b>the</b> Dutch <b>integration</b> policy in light of the European Commission's eleven common basic principles for immigrant <b>integration</b> policy in <b>the</b> European Union. In addition, ethical implications concerning <b>the</b> Dutch <b>integration</b> policy will be stated. Finally, the consequences of failing integration will be identified and some practical recommendations for <b>the</b> Dutch <b>integration</b> policy will be provided...|$|R

The British attitude has however responded to the dynamical development of <b>the</b> political <b>integration</b> in Europe. <b>The</b> aim of the thesis is to assess Britain's {{attitude towards}} <b>the</b> political <b>integration</b> in Europe and to prove that, despite its dynamical development, the elements of Euroscepticism prevail over the elements of Europeanization. With respect to the aim, the thesis is divided into three chapters. The first one explains <b>the</b> political <b>integration</b> and charts its development and defines the modern concept of Euroscepticism and Europeanization. The second chapter deals with Britain's attitude towards <b>the</b> European <b>integration,</b> its historical background and its development immediately after the Second World War.
