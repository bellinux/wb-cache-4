5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, {{and ground}} crew {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, where he was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|Battle Hill was {{the site}} of {{especially}} brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.|$|E

5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Despite missing {{much of the}} {{qualifying}} {{campaign with}} a shoulder injury, Solo {{was named to the}} U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany. After keeping clean sheets in group C wins over North Korea and Colombia, Solo conceded two goals in the 2–1 loss to Sweden which consigned <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> second place in the group and a quarterfinal meeting with Brazil.|$|E
5|$|May's {{squadron}} {{was attached}} as a direct-reporting unit {{to the newly}} promoted General Twiggs' 1st Texas Division, {{which was to be}} committed to the north side of Monterrey. On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> avert disaster, and after some intense urban fighting, General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans. Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E
50|$|Kirk Bloodsworth was <b>the</b> first <b>American</b> <b>to</b> {{be freed}} from death row {{as a result}} of exoneration by DNA fingerprinting. Ray Krone is <b>the</b> 100th <b>American</b> <b>to</b> have been sentenced to death and then later exonerated.|$|R

5|$|Parise next {{represented}} the United States at the under-20 level, {{playing at the}} 2003 World Junior Championships. Team USA finished in fourth place and Parise scored four goals and added four assists to finish eighth in tournament scoring. The following year, at the 2004 World Junior Championships, Parise led <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> their first-ever {{gold medal at the}} tournament. He scored five goals and added six assists and was awarded the Tournament MVP, Best Forward and was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with {{no alternative but to}} wait for <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> make the first move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish forces {{expected}} <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> {{attack the}} northern {{region of the}} island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. The Spanish government was also aware of a planned landing by the Americans at Fajardo, located {{on the east coast}} and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.|$|E

5000|$|In 1776, hostess Mary Lindley Murray entertained British {{officers}} {{at her home}} long enough for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> troops <b>to</b> escape.

5|$|Thơ {{then began}} to put try to put {{pressure}} on <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> influence Diệm. During a fact-finding mission by General Maxwell Taylor, the chief of the U.S. military, and Walt Rostow, Thơ and Minh complained of Diệm's autocratic ways and religious favoritism towards his fellow Catholics to the disadvantage of the majority Buddhist populace. In 1962, he told senior U.S. Embassy official Joseph Mendenhall that Diệm's military subordinates invented arbitrary and falsely inflated figures of Viet Cong fighters.|$|E
5|$|Vandegrift {{ordered the}} {{withdrawal}} {{because of the}} receipt of intelligence from coastwatchers, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent. Indeed, the Japanese {{were in the process}} of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> stop this reinforcement attempt resulted in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement effort was turned back.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces.|$|E
25|$|Cooper piloted {{the longest}} and final Mercury spaceflight in 1963.

5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> surrender, which was refused.|$|E
5|$|General Carleton {{arrived in}} Trois-Rivières {{late in the}} action. A {{detachment}} of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière-du-Loup, a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence. Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw, allowing most of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> escape, either because {{he did not want to}} deal with large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further. A significant number of Americans did not make it that far, and were captured. These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers. It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers. In all, 236 captives were taken. Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle, while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> then-new <b>American</b> president, Richard Nixon, {{started a}} process of Vietnamization <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} from Vietnam. One of the tenets of Vietnamization was responsible government in South Vietnam. <b>To</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> from installing their own government, a conference was held on June 6-8, 1969, off Route 22 in Cambodia's Fishhook area.|$|R
5|$|In 1762 Crillon {{moved to}} Spain, {{where he served}} as a lieutenant-general – the highest rank in the Bourbon armies – and was made a Knight of the Order of Charles III in 1780. During the Anglo-Spanish War, when Spain and France allied with <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> fight Britain, he was given command of a Spanish army tasked with {{capturing}} Minorca from the British. The army landed on the island on 19 August 1781 and laid siege to the British garrison in Fort St. Philip at Mahon. The siege was concluded successfully on 5 February 1782 when the British surrendered, for which Crillon was made a grandee of Spain and took the title of Duke of Crillon-Mahon. He was subsequently put in charge of the joint French and Spanish force that had been besieging Gibraltar since 1779. Despite his efforts, Gibraltar proved impregnable and peace was restored in 1783.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops who}} were not killed or {{captured}} escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, in a move considered controversial to this day, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy {{in control of the}} East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.|$|E
