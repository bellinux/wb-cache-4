Two sites {{have recently been}} tested in France, the first one paved with a five years old VTAC 0 / 4 and the second one paved {{with a one year}} old VTAC 0 / 6. The measurement campaign included tyre/road noise testing as well as assessment of <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> properties like 3 D texture and sound absorption. Close-ProXimity (CPX) and Coast-By (CB) tyre/road noise measurements were performed simultaneously over a distance of 20 meters long. The test vehicle was a passenger car fitted with patterned tyres. Several runs were performed at steady speed from 40 km/h up to 110 km/h, leading to the estimation of CPX and CB noise levels and spectra at different reference speeds. The 3 D texture of the <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> was evaluated with a newly developed device involving a 2 D laser sensor. The texture sample size was about 0. 35 m by 1. 5 m with a sampling interval of 0. 1 mm. A specific protocol was used to record four aligned texture samples with overlapping zones, leading to a final complete surface of about 6 m by 0. 35 m. Texture data were processed to get the height probability densities, the mean texture depth as well as the raw and the enveloped longitudinal texture spectra. Sound absorption was also measured following ISO 13472 - 1 leading to absorption peaks around 1000 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 4 and around 800 Hz for the VTAC 0 / 6. The CPX and CB noise results of the <b>tested</b> <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> are compared to results for reference <b>road</b> <b>surfaces,</b> i. e. a VTAC 0 / 6 and a DAC 0 / 10 located on a reference test track.

This report is a literature study mainly based on available literature from the period 2005 - 2011.   Focus has been on available data of tyre noise levels on ISO tracks, on other <b>test</b> track <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> and on <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> representative of pavements used in the Nordic countries. The main results are that the spread in noise levels on rough-textured <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> commonly found in Sweden and Norway is much less than found on ISO surfaces.

40|$|In {{order to}} get a view on the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> {{condition}} the Swedish Road Administration (SRA) uses both objective measurement mehods, mainly measurements of rut depth and unevenness, and road users, opinions on the roads condition. Objective measurements show that <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> condition in general has not changed to any greater extent during the latest years. Road user surveys show, however, that the road users, and not least the professional drivers, have become less satisfied with the operation and maintenace of the roads. To try to understand the cause of this discrepancy it is of interest to closer analyse the road users assessment of <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> condition. The report presents a driving simulator study, which is divided into two experiments. In the first experiment the importance of different impressions, i. e. visual appearance, noise and vibrations, is <b>tested</b> on a <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> with ruts as well as on a <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> with patchings/repairs. The analysis was based on driving data and on the drivers´ opinions on how comfortable and safe, respectively, the road was to drive on. The conclusion from the first experiment was that the visual apppearence alone does not influence speed, but lateral position. Noise has an influence on the variance of speed, and vibration has an influence on the variance of lateral position. Noise and vibration have an influence on speed in interaction with the visual appearance. The results of the drivers´ assessments of comfort and safety show a clear pattern where the visual appearance, the sound and the vibrations separately and in an additional way have an influence on the subjective experience of comfort and safety.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic rolling radius and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic rolling radius for low-profile radial tires <b>tested</b> on rigid <b>road</b> <b>surfaces.</b> On this basis, the classical slip calculation method was modified.

The main objective is to estimate local water depths trapped between the tire and the road asperities and to define a so-called “critical” water depth which can be used for driver assistance systems. Tests are performed in laboratory and on test tracks. It was found that the friction-water depth curves have an inverse-S shape and present an initial constant-friction part before decreasing to a minimum value.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the synthesis of compressed vibration test profiles representing much longer time histories obtained in <b>road</b> <b>testing</b> of ground vehicles. Vibration test profiles are defined as those related directly to operational <b>testing</b> on specific <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> and which summarise the input to the vehicle in the given conditions. The method extends classical Fourier transform technique by means of bump event correction in the background Fourier signal where the bump event term implies a high-amplitude transient event of the shock type. The orthogonal wavelet decomposition {{was used as a}} specific filtering tool facilitating bump event identification. Examples of seat guide vertical acceleration have been considered. Calculated probability density functions suggest the ability of the bump correction method to improve the statistical accuracy of the final vibration test profile with respect to the original road data. Test profiles obtained by means of Fourier transform synthesis with subsequent reinsertion of bump events from separated frequency bands were more accurate than those obtained by Fourier synthesis alone. Further developments led to advanced bump reinsertion with synchronisation of events occurring in different frequency bands at the same moment of time. Test profiles generated in this way have provided better accuracy compared to the non-synchronised algorithm...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany active vehicle {{safety systems}} such as {{electronic}} stability control (ESC), rollover prevention, and lane departure avoidance could benefit from knowledge of the vehicle slip angle. However, {{it is a challenge}} to design an observer to estimate slip angle reliably under a wide range of vehicle maneuvers and operating conditions. This is due especially to nonlinear tire characteristics and system models which have nonlinear output equations. Hence this paper develops an extended H_∞ circle criterion observer for state estimation in systems with nonlinear output equations. The observer design approach utilizes a modified Young’s relation to include additional degrees of freedom in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) used for observer gain design. This enhanced LMI is less conservative than others proposed in the literature for Lipschitz nonlinear systems, both with and without nonlinear output equations. The observer is applied to slip angle estimation and utilizes inexpensive sensors available in all modern vehicles. Finally, experimental tests on a Volvo XC 90 sport utility vehicle are used to evaluate the developed approach. The experimental results show that the slip angle estimates for a variety of <b>test</b> maneuvers on <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> with different friction coefficients are reliable...|$|R

Besides, if the heat stored is released, it can supply heat for buildings or raise the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperature for snow melting in winter. A road-solar energy system was built in this study, and the heat transfer mechanism and effect of the system were analyzed according to the monitored solar radiant heat, the solar energy absorbed by road and the heat stored by soil. The results showed that the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperature was mainly affected by solar radiation, but the effect is hysteretic in nature. The temperature of the solar <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> was 3 °C– 6 °C lower than that of the ordinary <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> The temperature of the solar road along the vertical direction was 2 °C– 5 °C lower than that of the ordinary road. The temperature difference increased as the distance to the heat transfer tubes decreased. The average solar collector efficiency of the system was 14. 4 %, and the average solar absorptivity of <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> was 36 %. Zhihua Zhou, Shan Hu, Xiaoyan Zhang, Jian Zu...|$|R
