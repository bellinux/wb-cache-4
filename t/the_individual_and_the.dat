5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions regarding <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ambient environment, {{this phenomenon}} {{has not been}} studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E

5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> self. The first such film, No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values {{in a time of}} political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E

On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage.

Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of karma to causality {{is a central}} motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought.

Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions {{do not have the}} same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.|$|E
