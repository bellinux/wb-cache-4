5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has {{operated}} forty-eight Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The type entered Australian service in December 1958, when No.36 Squadron accepted {{the first of}} <b>twelve</b> C-130As, replacing its venerable Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by <b>twelve</b> C-130Es, which equipped No.37 Squadron. The C-130As were replaced by <b>twelve</b> C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by <b>twelve</b> C-130J Super Hercules in 1999. No.37 Squadron became the RAAF's sole Hercules operator in 2006, when No.36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to converting to Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIII heavy transports. The C-130Hs were retired in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the only model in Australian service.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} to purchase another <b>twelve</b> C-130s {{was announced in}} November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the Vietnam War. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order <b>twelve</b> C-130E Hercules {{as part of a}} package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that also included ten Lockheed P-3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S-2 Tracker maritime patrol aircraft, as well as <b>twelve</b> Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965. In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the Australian Army, demonstrated by the first <b>twelve</b> aircraft. The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; <b>twelve</b> C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.|$|E
