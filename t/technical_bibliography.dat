40|$|Sinusoidally fed {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) fulfill the special features required for traction motors {{to be applied}} in electric vehicles (EV). Among them, axial flux {{permanent magnet}} (AFPM) synchronous motors are especially suited for in-wheel applications. Electric motors used in such applications must meet two main requirements, i. e. high power density and fault tolerance. This paper deals with the optimal design of an AFPM for in-wheel applications used to drive an electrical scooter. The single-objective optimization process carried out in this paper is based on designing the AFPM to obtain an optimized power density while ensuring appropriate fault tolerance requirements. For this purpose a set of analytical equations are applied to obtain the geometrical, electric and mechanical parameters of the optimized AFPM and several design restrictions are applied to ensure fault tolerance capability. The optimization process {{is based on a}} genetic algorithm and two more constrained nonlinear optimization algorithms in which the objective function is the power density.

The finding about the perception of the D 3 motorway in the affected municipalities were based on detailed analysis of statistical data and in-depth analysis of the interviews.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evaluation of}} correlations for calculation of concrete compression strength using nondestructive testing parameters for both impact and ultrasonic pulse methods, as listed in EN 13791 : 2007. This standard indicates procedures relating to compression strength determination in construction and building elements. These procedures relate to compression strength evaluation based either on test specimens (drill cores) or combination of NDT and drill core testing. These nondestructive methods {{are not covered}} by procedures taking into account only nondestructive testing parameter pursuant to common calibration correlation. Correlation based on Schmidt impact hammer rebound does not respect various positions of this instrument although positioning of the same is essential for rebound value. No specific type of impact hammer is given for particular calculation correlation. In addition, another challenge is preparation of test surface along with evaluation of impact hammer measurement according to EN 12504 - 2 as compared with EN 13791. Dispersion of significant values varies between 15 % and 50 % depending upon specific values of impact hammer rebound.

40|$|The thermostructural {{response}} of carbon phenolic components in a solid rocket motor (SRM) {{is a complex}} process. It involves simultaneous heat and mass transfer along with chemical reactions in a multiphase system with time-dependent material properties and boundary conditions. In contrast to metals, the fracture of fiber-reinforced composites {{is characterized by the}} initiation and progression of multiple failures of different modes such as matrix cracks, interfacial debonding, fiber breaks, and delamination. The investigation of thermostructural responses of SRM carbon phenolics is further complicated by different failure modes under static and dynamic load applications. Historically, there have been several types of post-firing anomalies found in the carbon phenolic composites of the Space Shuttle SRM nozzle. Three major failure modes which have been observed on SRM nozzles are pocketing (spallation), ply-lift, and wedge-out. In order to efficiently control these anomalous phenomena, an investigation of fracture mechanisms under NASA/MSFC RSRM (Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor) and SPIP (Solid Propulsion Integrity Program) programs have been conducted following each anomaly. This report reviews the current progress in understanding the effects of the thermostructural behavior of carbon phenolics on the failure mechanisms of the SRM nozzle. A literature search was conducted and a <b>technical</b> <b>bibliography</b> was developed to support consolidation and assimilation of learning from the RSRM and SPIP investigation efforts. Another important objective of this report is to present a knowledge-based design basis for carbon phenolics that combines the analyses of thermochemical decomposition, pore pressure stresses, and thermostructural properties. Possible areas of application of the knowledge-based design include critical material properties development, nozzle component design, and SRM materials control...|$|E

The theoretical part dealt with questions of those factors which influence the nurse - patient interrelation. The thesis tried to describe {{the most important factors}} which effect the establishing of the patient [...] nurse interrelation; it tried to describe nurses points of view as well as patients points of view because their views can be fundamentally different and in a way they can zoom in some out-patients aspects. The length of waiting time for treatments, overall impressions related to their visits in emergency rooms, patients characters and the level of emergency room nurses stress play significant roles. Two targets were set in the practical part of my thesis. The first target was to map factors which take share in forming a positive client [...] nurse relation in emergency room care. The second target of my thesis was to map factors which take share in forming a positive nurse [...] client relation in emergency room care. Furthermore, five hypotheses were set. The first hypothesis was: "Waiting time before treatment influences nurse - client relation. q The second hypothesis was: "Women are more willing to cooperate than men. q The third hypothesis was: "The shorter the clients waiting time for treatment, the more willing s/he is to cooperate. q The fourth hypothesis was: "Emergency room nurses high stress influences her relation to clients. q The fifth hypothesis was: "A large number of clients waiting for treatment are a strong stress factor for nurses. The qualitative method with the anonymous questionnaire technique was used for the real status discovery. Two kinds of questionnaires were used. The patients questionnaire contained 24 questions. The questions were closed ones and half-open ones - for amending of brief answers. The introductory questions were identifying ones. The other questions were focused on positives and negatives which are closely connected with visits in emergency rooms. Nurses questionnaire contained 29 questions, which were closed ones and half-open ones - for amending of brief answers and one question was open one - for expressing of their own opinion. The introductory questions in the questionnaires were identifying ones. The other questions were focused on positives and negatives which are connected with providing care to patients who come into emergency rooms for treatments. Treated patients, emergency room nurses and ordination nurses in Písek, Strakonice and Brno were my research population. 200 questionnaires were distributed; 100 questionnaires were distributed to emergency room nurses and 100 questionnaires were distributed to patients who were treated in emergency rooms.
