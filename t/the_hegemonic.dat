40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore the {{relationship}} between geopolitical codes and hegemonic cycles as two crucial concepts {{in the context of}} the geopolitical world order.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the dynasty, the Chinese empire {{continued}} to be <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> power in East Asia. Although there was no formal ministry of foreign relations, the Lifan Yuan was responsible for relations with the Mongol and Tibetans in Central Asia, while the tributary system, a loose set of institutions and customs taken over from the Ming, in theory governed relations with East and Southeast Asian countries. The Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) stabilized relations with Czarist Russia.|$|E
25|$|After the Napoleonic Era, {{nationalism}} {{emerged as}} the dominant ideology in Europe. In Italy several intellectuals and groups began to push {{the idea of a}} unified nation-state (see Risorgimento). At the time, the struggle for Italian unification was largely waged against the Austrian Empire, which was <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> power in Italy and the single most powerful adversary to unification. The Austrian Empire vigorously repressed the growing nationalist sentiment among Italian elites, most of all during 1848 revolution and the following years. Italy finally attained independence in 1861; Venetia was annexed in 1866, and Latium, including Rome, in 1870.|$|E
25|$|The Aztec empire was an {{informal}} or hegemonic empire {{because it did}} not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. <b>The</b> <b>hegemonic</b> nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were paid.|$|E

Blackface is used as a way to connect with African-Americans and <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> racial structure that exists in the United States. Japan is seen as a homogenous and insular group, and the use of blackface shows that the youth of Japan are not only concerned with Japanese issues, but issues on a global level.|$|E
25|$|The period {{beginning}} in 1990 marked {{a shift in}} the politics of Mexico which would change the country from <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> control of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 1989, the first governorship in the country in 60 years, passed from the PRI to a National Action Party (PAN) candidate. That event was followed in 1997 by PRI's loss of control of the lower house and in 2000, loss of the presidency. The impact that end of the virtual one-party-rule would have on women in Mexico was an open question. 1990 also saw the birth of Debate Feminista (Feminist Debate) a publication founded by Marta Lamas and aimed connecting academic feminist theory with the practices of activists in the women’s movement.

25|$|The {{tribes that}} were to {{comprise}} the Khazar empire were not an ethnic union, but a congeries of steppe nomads and peoples who came to be subordinated, and subscribed to a core Türkic leadership. Many Turkic groups, such as the Oğuric peoples, including Šarağurs, Oğurs, Onoğurs, and Bulğars who earlier formed part of the Tiĕlè (鐵勒) confederation, are attested quite early, having been driven West by the Sabirs, who in turn fled the Asian Avars, and began to flow into the Volga-Caspian-Pontic zone from {{as early as the}} 4th century CE and are recorded by Priscus to reside in the Western Eurasian steppelands as early as 463. They appear to stem from Mongolia and South Siberia {{in the aftermath of the}} fall of the Hunnic/Xiōngnú nomadic polities. A variegated tribal federation led by these Turks, probably comprising a complex assortment of Iranian, proto-Mongolic, Uralic, and Palaeo-Siberian clans, vanquished the Rouran Khaganate of <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> central Asian Avars in 552 and swept westwards, taking in their train other steppe nomads and peoples from Sogdiana.|$|E
25|$|Europe's {{access to}} a larger {{quantity}} of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it a distinct advantage through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their colonies, including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought a distinct advantage to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to proto-industrialize, they would turn to import substitution, depriving <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, {{they were able to}} prevent this from happening. Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from India. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier. Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century. The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.|$|E
25|$|As the 16th {{century had}} worn on, {{inflation}} in Spain (a result of state debt and, more importantly, {{the importation of}} silver and gold from the New World) triggered hardship for the peasantry. The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable {{when compared to the}} 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution. Spain, which along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an inclosure movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. The higher inflation, the burden of the Habsburgs' wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns. Another factor was the militaristic nature of the Castilian nobility, which had developed during the centuries of the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula. They preferred careers in the government bureaucracy, the military, or the church, shunning economic activities. This militarism also meant that Spain exhausted its wealth and manpower in near-continuous wars. Under Philip II, these wars {{had much to do with}} combating Protestantism, but in the 17th century it became clear that the world that had existed before 1517 could not be restored. Spain's wars during that century became increasingly more to do with preserving <b>the</b> <b>hegemonic</b> power of the Habsburg alliance in Europe; although it should be noted that the Habsburg alliance was successful in buttressing the Catholic Church against the rise of Protestantism.|$|E

40|$|While <b>the</b> {{notion of}} <b>hegemonic</b> masculinity has {{received}} a lot of attention in recent scholarship, hegemonic femininity remains largely underdeveloped.

The specific femininities that are considered to be hegemonic are highly context-dependent, and, unlike masculinities, the hegemony of femininities is a matter of internal degree—that is, certain femininities take hegemonic status compared to other femininities but do not take a dominant position in <b>the</b> gender order.

While the North Korean leaders enthusiastically welcomed the plan, it soon foundered on Hanoi’s opposition.

[...] Indeed, the issue of Vietnamese versus Chinese hegemony over Indochina greatly influenced the attitude Hanoi adopted towards Moscow in the early and mid-1970s. During the Cambodian civil war, the Soviet leaders, ready to acquiesce in Hanoi’s dominance over Laos and Cambodia, actually insisted on sending their aid shipments to the Khmer Rouge through the DRV, whereas China firmly rebuffed Hanoi's proposal that Chinese aid to Cambodia be sent via North Vietnam. Facing Chinese competition and Soviet acquiescence, the North Vietnamese leaders found the Soviet option more advantageous to their interests, a calculation that played a major role in the gradual pro-Soviet shift in Hanoi's foreign policies.|$|E
