He reacted to the award by stating: [...] "A few <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I've had these experiences that are just kind of too big to process and this looks like it's {{going to be one of}} those times." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kim Newman in his book, Nightmare Movies, when Reeves made a {{suggestion}} on the set, Price objected {{and told the}} director: [...] "I've made 87 [...] films. What have you done?" [...] And Reeves responded: [...] "I've made three good ones." [...] "Reeves hated me," [...] Price later recalled. [...] "He didn't want me at all for the part. I didn't like him, either. It {{was one of the}} first <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that I've been in a picture where the director and I just clashed." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he socialized {{with his}} {{teammates}} and sometimes gambled, Sunday {{was never a}} heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, [...] "I never drank much. I was never drunk but four <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> ... I {{used to go to}} the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade." [...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E

500|$|In August 2000, Gingrich married Callista Bisek {{four months}} after his divorce from Marianne was finalized. He and Callista live in McLean, Virginia. In a 2011 {{interview}} with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Gingrich addressed his past infidelities by saying, [...] "There's no question at <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked too hard and things happened {{in my life that}} were not appropriate." [...] In December 2011, after the group Iowans for Christian Leaders in Government requested that he sign their so-called [...] "Marriage Vow", Gingrich sent a lengthy written response. It included his pledge to [...] "uphold personal fidelity to my spouse".|$|E
500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> the hair on my arms has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, Aaliyah {{finished}} {{recording the}} album after having filmed her part in Queen of the Damned for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> [...] I {{just want to be}} by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally." [...] Aaliyah was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
