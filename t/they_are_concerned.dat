25|$|Logic is {{concerned}} with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a metaphysician does. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.|$|E

Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|Summing up the {{experience}} of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development. It must be admitted, however, that the pattern of development is complex and the effect upon it of foreign assistance is still not clearly determined. But the limited evidence available suggests that the forms in which foreign resources have been extended to Africa over the past twenty-five years, insofar as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> with economic development, are, to a great extent, counterproductive.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they are comfortable with their own genitals, or because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} main {{windows in the}} choir aisles, two on each side, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> with the four Gospels. [...] The windows {{on the north side}} are original, but those on the south side were {{destroyed}} by bombing and were renewed. [...] In the renewal, the central mullion of these windows was widened, and the design of the glass was simplified and made more vibrant. [...] Each window, known by its predominant colour, shows the author of the gospel at the top with his symbol. [...] Below are figures linked with {{the subject matter of the}} gospel. [...] The windows on the north side are by Brown, the left window, the Sapphire window, represents Saint Matthew and shows a depiction of the Nativity on one side, and the Epiphany on the other. [...] The 'Gold' window commemorates Saint Luke and shows the Feeding of the Five thousand, and the Raising of Jairus' daughter. [...] The windows on the south side are by Hogan. [...] The Ruby window represents Saint John and includes biblical scenes together with the Old Testament figures of Daniel, Ezekiel, Jonah, and Job. [...] Saint Mark is in the Emerald window, with scenes of the Baptism of Jesus and the Transfiguration. [...] Also included are the disciples Saint Simon and Saint Andrew, and the Old Testament figures, Noah, Zechariah, Enoch, and Malachi. [...] At the east ends of the aisles are rose windows by Brown. [...] The window in the north aisle relates to [...] "journeys across the sea and undertaken in faith", namely Moses crossing the Red Sea, Saint Paul's journey to Rome, SaintColumba planting a cross on Iona, and missionaries of the Melanesian Mission landing in the Solomon Islands. [...] The images in the rose window in the south aisle show instances of God's power being demonstrated through water, namely Noah holding a model of the ark, Jesus calming the disciples in a storm, Jesus walking on water, and Saint Paul after his shipwreck in Malta.|$|E
