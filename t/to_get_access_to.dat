The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads.

5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E
5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line.|$|E

5|$|Series 4, Episode 8 is {{the final}} episode of the fourth series of the British comedy-drama {{television}} series Cold Feet. It was written by Mike Bullen, directed by Ciaran Donnelly, and was first broadcast on the ITV network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) travel to Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod (Gary Sweet) suspects that Pete is only marrying her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets cold feet and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been {{having an affair with}} her colleague Mark (Sean Pertwee) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.|$|E

In {{the second part of the}} paper we explore models of occupational attainment among immigrants and the native born. Our findings suggest that, contrary to what is observed for natives, immigrants' human capital does not contribute <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> high-paying occupations...|$|R
25|$|An achilles {{heel of the}} Indian {{nuclear power}} programme, however, {{is the fact that}} they are not signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

25|$|The Caledonian Railway had {{intended}} to lease, or absorb, the Scottish Central Railway (SCR), which obtained its Act of Parliament {{on the same day}} as the Caledonian. The SCR needed a partner railway <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the rival Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E) would provide that. The SCR opened from Greenhill Junction with the E to Perth on 22 May 1848, and the Caledonian opened its branch to reach Greenhill Junction on 7 August 1848. The SCR remained independent for some time, mainly because of Parliamentary opposition to proposed mergers. The SCR built Perth General station, which became the focus of several railways at that traffic centre, and a Joint Committee managed the station.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, Buell's army, {{in pursuit}} of Bragg, converged on the small {{crossroads}} town of Perryville in three columns. Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general, on Peters Hill, when the Confederate infantry arrived. Both sides were desperate <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> fresh water. The next day, at dawn, fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike, halting just before the Confederate line. After noon, a Confederate division struck the Union left flank—the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook—and forced it to fall back. When more Confederate divisions joined the fray, the Union line made a stubborn stand, counterattacked, but finally fell back with some units routed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} key drivers of Sino-foreign {{alliance}} formation {{from the perspective}} of both Chinese and Western alliance partners.

In analyzing the differences among Chinese and Western alliance motives, this paper shows how the initial deficiencies in the Chinese institutional environment has shaped the strategic motives of local companies and consequently lead to the diverging alliance formation motives in Sino-foreign alliances. ...|$|R

Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.|$|E
