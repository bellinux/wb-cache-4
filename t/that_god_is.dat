5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> infinite. His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's goodness is limitless, and as God's goodness is essential, God is also limitless.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{conceptual}} truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being {{that can be}} imagined).|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E
5000|$|Hellenic Christians {{and their}} medieval successors then applied this Form-based {{philosophy}} to the Christian God. Philosophers {{took all the}} things that they considered good, Power, Love, Knowledge and Size, and posited <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> [...] "infinite" [...] in all these respects. They then concluded <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent. Since <b>God</b> <b>was</b> perfect, any change would make him less than perfect, so they asserted <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> unchanging, or immutable.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day he found his mind still further changed. He no longer felt <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> in Pall Mall or St. James's Park, whither he resorted to walk and muse. He felt now <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> somewhere about the horizon....|$|R
60|$|Thus Abimelech saw <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> with Abraham (Gen 21:22). Thus Abimelech saw <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> with Isaac (Gen 26:20,29). Pharaoh knew <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> with Joseph (Gen 41:38). Saul 'saw {{and knew}} that the Lord was with David' (1 Sam 18:28). Saul's servant knew that the Lord was with Samuel (1 Sam 9:6). Belshazzar's queen knew, also, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> with Daniel. Darius knew, also, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> with Daniel. And when the enemy saw the boldness of Peter and John, 'they took {{knowledge}} of them {{that they had been}} with Jesus' (Acts 4:13). The girl that was a witch, knew that Paul was a servant of the most high God (Acts 16:17). There is a glory upon them <b>that</b> have <b>God</b> with them, a glory that sometimes glances and flashes out into the faces of those that behold the people of God; 'And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly upon him, saw Stephen's face, as it had been the face of an angel'; such rays of Divine majesty did show themselves therein (Acts 6:15).|$|R
5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings state <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> {{too great}} {{for humans to}} fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.|$|E
60|$|He {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> helping him; {{therefore he}} {{had no need to}} oppress or overreach any man. He believed <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> eye <b>was</b> on him; therefore he dared not oppress or overreach any man.|$|R

25|$|Gödel was a {{convinced}} theist, in the Christian tradition. He {{held the}} notion <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> personal.|$|R
5|$|Therefore I shall again {{repeat the}} {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, as it is positively affirmed in Scripture: <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> there expressed in three different names, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghost: that each of these is God, and that there is but one God. But this union and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind.|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E

5000|$|He wrote a {{book titled}} [...] "Baptism and Infant Baptism" [...] (Swedish: Dop och Barndop). But perhaps his {{greatest}} legacy is his understanding of Justification and Atonement. He rejected that the prevailing notion <b>that</b> <b>God's</b> wrath <b>was</b> satisfied by the cross because it made God the object of reconciliation and lacked scriptural support. He instead asserted <b>that</b> humanity, not <b>God,</b> <b>was</b> {{the object of the}} Atonement; <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> the initiator, not the recipient, of the work of reconciliation in Christ.|$|R
2500|$|Hermann Cohen {{rejected}} Spinoza's idea <b>that</b> <b>God</b> can <b>be</b> {{found in}} nature, but agreed <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>was</b> not a personal being. Rather, he saw God as an ideal, an archetype of morality. Not only can <b>God</b> not <b>be</b> identified with nature, but <b>God</b> <b>is</b> also incomparable to {{anything in the}} world. This <b>is</b> because <b>God</b> <b>is</b> “One,” unique and unlike anything else. One loves and worships God through living ethically and obeying His moral law: “love of <b>God</b> <b>is</b> love of morality.” ...|$|R
5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} argues <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> not omnipotent: {{rather than}} coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5000|$|A {{commonly}} held [...] understanding in Kabbalah {{is that the}} concept of tzimtzum contains a built-in paradox, requiring <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>be</b> simultaneously transcendent and immanent.|$|R

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: <b>that</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
