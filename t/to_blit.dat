5000|$|Blitting {{moves the}} same types of {{patterns}} about the screen, but does so by writing into the same memory {{as the rest of the}} display. This means every time the pattern is placed on the screen, the display [...] "under" [...] it is overwritten, or [...] "damaged". It is up to the software to clean this damage up by blitting twice, once to remove the damage, and then again to place the bit in its new location. However, there are several ways to optimize this. If large areas of the screen are taken over by the patterns, it may be more efficient <b>to</b> <b>blit</b> the background to the screen instead of erasing each pattern individually. A variation involves dividing the screen into segments and erasing only the segments where patterns have been drawn on. This technique is known as dirty rectangles.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{windowing}} systems allow graphics {{applications to}} directly access the {{graphics processing unit}} (GPU) for fast rendering. However, application tasks that render frames on the GPU contend heavily with the windowing server that also accesses the GPU <b>to</b> <b>blit</b> the rendered frames to the screen. This resource-sharing nature of direct rendering introduces core challenges of priority inversion and temporal isolation in multi-tasking environments. In this paper, we identify and address resource-sharing problems raised in GPU-accelerated windowing systems. Specifically, we propose two protocols that enable application tasks to efficiently share the GPU resource in the X Window System. The Priority Inheritance with X server (PIX) proto-col eliminates priority inversion caused in accessing the GPU, and the Reserve Inheritance with X server (RIX) protocol ad-dresses the same problem for resource-reservation systems. Our design and implementation of these protocols highlight the fact that neither the X server nor user applications need modifications to use our solutions. Our evaluation demon-strates that multiple GPU-accelerated graphics applications running concurrently in the X Window System can be correctly prioritized and isolated by the PIX and the RIX protocols. ...|$|E
50|$|Modern {{computer}} graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, {{due to the}} relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for blitting operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated <b>to</b> <b>blitting</b> {{is known as a}} Blitter chip.|$|R
50|$|MicroAngelo also {{supported}} a light pen, connected through input terminals {{on the top}} of the card. The Screenware software automatically converted the coordinates into the card's coordinates. Screenware also included routines for drawing movable cursors in hardware (as opposed <b>to</b> bit <b>bliting),</b> and the cursor could be made to follow the light pen simply by reading the pen coordinates and feeding them into the cursor.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, after 2 and a {{half years}} of debate and protest, the University of Delaware's {{administration}} reached a settlement that once again allowed Gottfredson and Jan <b>Blits</b> <b>to</b> continue receiving research funding from the Pioneer Fund.|$|R
50|$|When it {{is turned}} on, the Copper has three states; either reading an instruction, {{executing}} it, or {{waiting for a}} specific video beam position. The Copper runs a program called the Copper list in parallel with the main CPU. The Copper runs {{in sync with the}} video beam, and {{it can be used to}} perform various operations which require video synchronization. Most commonly it is used to control video output, but it can write to most of the chipset registers and thus can be used <b>to</b> initiate <b>blits,</b> set audio registers, or interrupt the CPU.|$|R
50|$|As {{one might}} imagine, this makes {{blitting}} significantly slower than sprite manipulation. However, blitting has one very big advantage: {{there is no}} physical limit {{to the number of}} patterns you can <b>blit,</b> or <b>to</b> the size of the patterns. Thus you can use <b>blitting</b> <b>to</b> display anything on the screen, including simulating sprites (through the double-write pattern noted above), or even text.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Increasingly, a {{small number}} of low-wage {{countries}} such as China and India are involved in incremental innovation. That is, they are responsible for resolving production-line bugs and suggesting product improvements. We provide evidence of this new phenomenon and develop a model {{in which there is a}} transition from old-style product-cycle trade to trade involving incremental innovation in low-wage countries. The model explains why levels of involvement in incremental innovation vary across low-wage countries and across firms within each low-wage country. We draw out implications for sectoral earnings, living standards, the capital account and, foremost, international trade in goods. Key words: international trade, low-wage country innovation jel classification: f 1 ∗ We are thankful <b>to</b> Joel <b>Blit</b> for research assistance.

5000|$|Monster Maker's blitter engine used {{a custom}} sprite codec that was highly {{optimized}} for unique content aspects of monster parts. Each part in Monster Maker used a special palette that had four [...] "part colors" [...] and four [...] "sticky colors". The part colors could be changed during <b>blit</b> <b>to</b> allow {{the user to}} change the color of parts on the screen. The sticky color could also be changed during the blit, {{and it would take}} on the part color of whatever the part was stuck to. For example, an arm could take on the color of whatever body it was stuck to.|$|R
50|$|While early accelerators {{focused on}} {{improving}} {{the performance of}} 2D GUI systems, most modern accelerators focus on producing 3D imagery in real time. A common design is to send commands to the graphics accelerator using a library such as OpenGL or Direct3D. The graphics driver then translates those commands to instructions for the accelerator's graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU uses those microinstructions to compute the rasterized results. Those results are bit <b>blitted</b> <b>to</b> the framebuffer. The framebuffer's signal is then produced in combination with built-in video overlay devices (usually used to produce the mouse cursor without modifying the framebuffer's data) and any analog special effects that are produced by modifying the output signal. An example of such analog modification was the spatial anti-aliasing technique used by the 3dfx Voodoo cards. These cards add a slight blur to output signal that makes aliasing of the rasterized graphics much less obvious.|$|R
25|$|The 256-element free Boolean algebra {{on three}} {{generators}} is deployed in computer displays based on raster graphics, which use bit <b>blit</b> <b>to</b> manipulate whole regions consisting of pixels, relying on Boolean operations to specify how the source region should {{be combined with}} the destination, typically {{with the help of}} a third region called the mask. Modern video cards offer all 223=256 ternary operations for this purpose, with the choice of operation being a one-byte (8-bit) parameter. The constants SRC = 0xaa or 10101010, DST = 0xcc or 11001100, and MSK = 0xf0 or 11110000 allow Boolean operations such as (SRC^DST) (meaning XOR the source and destination and then AND the result with the mask) to be written directly as a constant denoting a byte calculated at compile time, 0x60 in the (SRC^DST) example, 0x66 if just SRC^DST, etc. At run time the video card interprets the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression.|$|R
