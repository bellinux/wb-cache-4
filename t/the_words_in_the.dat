5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E
25|$|Pick-a-Tune—Each tune would {{feature a}} list of words which {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tune's title. Contestants eliminated words so that only <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> title remained. This game was featured early in the first season of the 1974 syndicated series.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{literature}} uses several {{words in}} its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew language compared to the words in Koine Greek, the language of both the Septuagint and the New Testament. While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the Aramaic language, some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages {{in each of these}} languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbers are}} written after some of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tables.

Notice that the type of accentuation of a word is shown by the place in the table and the number added means only an alternative accentuation type, which is not necessarily the main one. Some of the alternative accentuation patterns of a word are used equally (then they are given not in brackets here), some are known from dialects, not preferred (then they are given in brackets).|$|E
25|$|Translation {{has given}} rise to a number of issues, as the {{original}} languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. While the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy states that inerrancy applies only to the original languages, some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the King-James-Only Movement. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because some of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.|$|E

25|$|The {{database}} {{draws upon}} some 4,300 Hebrew sources, from the classic Rabbinic literature period (2nd century BCE) through the Geonic period (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the Dead Sea Scrolls, inscriptions, Talmud and Midrash, Geonic literature, prayer and piyyut, Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> database and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, {{as well as}} of specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre. It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue when}} using n-gram {{language}} models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered {{in computational linguistics}} and natural language processing when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, {{it may be necessary}} to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vocabulary even if they were not observed.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E

25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold {{than the}} real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impugned publication or speech are to be looked at alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] {{opens the}} album with the lines [...] "If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream/ Where {{immobile}} steel rims crack, and the ditch {{in the back}} roads stop [...] ", which according to Erik Hage shows Morrison had [...] "once and for all pulled neck and neck with Dylan as a lyricist". [...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs {{where you can see}} {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on it any more than that." [...] <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived.

500|$|Potter {{completed}} {{the text of}} Timmy Tiptoes but decided it was too long. She was also uncertain exactly how to put the bird calls into print.

The songs of the little birds will be easier to judge as to spelling when one sees it in type." [...] The illustrations presented another problem. For her earlier productions, Potter was able to observe the species concerned in the wild, and kept specimens at home as pets and models. For Timmy Tiptoes however, she was unable to do so. Instead, she relied on specimens in the London Zoological Gardens as models, and checked photographs in reference books including one from the firm of taxidermist Rowland Ward. [...] "The book obtained from Rowland Ward will be very useful," [...] she wrote.|$|E

During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994). <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as [...] "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical".

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song.

Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I {{got a lot of}} great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
