5|$|Ramprasad is {{credited}} with creating a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk. His songs are sung <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit ("Songs of Ramprasad")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal.|$|E

25|$|Gatwick {{has been}} {{included}} {{in a number of}} reviews of airport capacity in southeastern England. Expansion options have included a third terminal and a second runway, although a 40-year agreement not to build a second runway was made in 1979 with West Sussex County Council. Expanded operations would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new terminal between two wide-spaced runways.

25|$|Aleppo {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{stations}} of Syria that has been connected with the Baghdad Railway in 1912, within the Ottoman Empire. The connections to Turkey and onwards to Ankara still exist <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twice weekly train from Damascus. It is perhaps for this historical reason that Aleppo is the headquarters of Syria national railway network, Chemins de Fer Syriens. As the railway is relatively slow, much of the passenger traffic to the port of Latakia had moved to road-based air-conditioned coaches. But this has reversed in recent years with the 2005 introduction of South Korean built DMUs providing a regular bi-hourly express service to both Latakia and Damascus, which miss intermediate stations.|$|E

25|$|Between November 1939 and March 1940 pilot {{ratings were}} revised to the {{permanent}} three-tier system with objective standards that exists <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total of eight ratings overall. Graduation from Advanced Flying School {{was required to}} be rated a Pilot; ten years service and 1,800 hours of military flight for Senior Pilot rating; and either 15 years service with 3,000 hours, or 20 years service with 2,000 hours, to become a Command Pilot. For both advanced ratings, hours as a pilot or navigator (a specialization then performed only by rated pilots) were calculated at 100%, but military flight hours in any other capacity were calculated at a 50% rate. The Air Corps also divided the former Airplane Observer rating into that of Combat Observer and Technical Observer.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, the South Engine Drain was routed {{under the}} Torne through a syphon, {{and became the}} third of the Three Rivers. The 1887 Ordnance Survey map shows only the Torne flowing eastwards from Pilfrey Bridge. As it {{approaches}} Althorpe, it splits into two, and uses both of the sluices into the Trent. The Folly Drain turns {{to the south and}} joins the Trent at Derrythorpe. By 1946/51, maps show a connection between the Torne and the middle of the Three Rivers, with a connection between the middle channel and the east channel downstream of Pilfrey Bridge. By 1966, the channels are inter-connected much as they are <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sluice between the Folly Drain and the South Engine Drain, and the sluices at Althorpe and Derrythorpe no longer used.|$|E

25|$|A forced {{marriage}} may {{be regarded as}} a form of slavery by {{one or more of the}} parties involved in the marriage, as well as by people observing the marriage. People forced into marriage can be required to engage in sexual activity or to perform domestic duties or other work without any personal control. The customs of bride price and dowry that exist in many parts of the world can lead to buying and selling people into marriage. Forced marriage continues to be practiced in parts of the world including some parts of Asia and Africa. Forced marriages may also occur in immigrant communities in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. Marriage by abduction occurs in many places in the world <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> national average of 69% of marriages in Ethiopia being through abduction.|$|E
25|$|When Buddhism was {{introduced}} through China in the Asuka period (6th century), rather than discarding the old belief system, the Japanese tried {{to reconcile the}} two, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (寺, tera) were attached to local Shinto shrines (神社, jinja) and vice versa and devoted to both kami and buddhas. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never quite fused, but remained however inextricably linked {{all the way to}} the present day, always interacting. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen for example in the fact that much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines we see <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large worship hall and religious images, are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century, and in many ways the blending of the two still continues.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recorded}} in the Post Office archives that the first box in the UK was erected in Botchergate, Carlisle in 1853. This fact is commemorated <b>today</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> replica Penfold box, located between the Market Cross and the Old Town Hall, in Carlisle city centre. The first six in London were installed on 11 April 1855. The earliest surviving UK designs are four Butt boxes made in Gloucester for the Western Area. These are at Barnes Cross, near Sherborne, Dorset, inside the former Britannia Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth, in the Haverfordwest town museum (formerly at Merlin's Bridge) and in the British Postal Museum & Archive store at Debden (formerly at Ventnor railway station, Isle of Wight). All date from 1853–59, with Barnes Cross {{being one of the}} later batch. The oldest pillar boxes still in use by the Royal Mail are at Framlingham in Suffolk. This pair were founded by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby in 1856. They are at Double Street and College Road. A third octagonal pillar of this type was at Gobweston in Lincolnshire and is now in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. 1856 also saw various designs introduced in Scotland and the Midlands. The postbox believed to be the oldest in Scotland, is a wall box which sits {{on the front of the}} Golspie Inn (formerly the Sutherland Arms Hotel). It carries the Royal Cypher of Queen Victoria and dates back to 1861.|$|E

500|$|The {{working or}} draught type {{is the oldest}} of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own {{separate}} breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though {{the oldest of the}} Finnhorse types, it is rare <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the working section as of 2004. Draught-type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger draught breeds. An average [...] horse in draught work is capable of pulling about 80percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110percent. In work horse competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200percent of their own body weight.|$|E
