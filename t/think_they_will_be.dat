500|$|Kevin McHale deemed [...] "Wheels" [...] the [...] "most serious" [...] {{episode of}} Glee so far. He enjoyed Artie's {{character}} {{development in the}} episode, explaining {{that when he was}} cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him. He believed that Artie became paralysed later in life, rather than being born that way, which was proven correct in [...] "Wheels". Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina, McHale opined: [...] "I think Tina and Artie will be together. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a couple for a long time." [...] He explained that {{from the beginning of the}} show's production, creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure [...] "why he was being so dramatic". He concluded however: [...] "I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do." [...] McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple, as they are best friends in real life.|$|E
2500|$|King {{played a}} major {{diplomatic}} role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805). With that in mind, {{he was able to}} successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty being an avid supporter of it. King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, [...] "I certainly do not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country." [...] Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.|$|E
2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the albums {{name is a}} pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the [...] "666 sect"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention {{to the topic of}} vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message. [...] "It's the only song I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to play on the radio" [...] said Ogre, continuing [...] "I hope they do play it because it's {{the only way we can}} go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message". [...] "Testure" [...] also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988, scoring thirteenth place in the magazine's year end list.|$|E

5000|$|The Blue Lamp premiered on 20 January 1950 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and the {{reviewer}} for The Times {{found the}} depiction of the police work very plausible and realistic, and praised the performances of Dirk Bogarde and Peggy Evans, but found Jack Warner's and Jimmy Hanley's two policemen portrayed in a too traditional way: [...] "There is an indefinable feel of the theatrical backcloth behind their words and actions ...
