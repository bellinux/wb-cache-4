Here we describe <b>Tweek,</b> a conserved protein that is required for synaptic vesicle recycling. <b>tweek</b> mutants show reduced FM 1 - 43 uptake, cannot maintain release during intense stimulation, and harbor larger than normal synaptic vesicles, implicating it in vesicle recycling at the synapse. Interestingly, the levels of a fluorescent PI(4, 5) P 2 reporter are reduced at <b>tweek</b> mutant synapses, and the probe is aberrantly localized during stimulation. In addition, various endocytic adaptors known to bind PI(4, 5) P 2 are mislocalized and the defects in FM 1 - 43 dye uptake and adaptor localization are partially suppressed by removing one copy of the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, suggesting a role for <b>Tweek</b> in maintaining proper phosphoinositide levels at synapses.

Allahabad and Nainital stations were in 100 % and 85 % of the totality paths. Observations suggest that about 30 - 40 % obscuration of solar disc {{can lead to}} the <b>tweeks</b> occurrence which otherwise occur only in nighttime. A total of 148 <b>tweeks</b> at Allahabad and 20 <b>tweeks</b> at Nainital were recorded with some of them up to 3 rd harmonics. The World Wide Lightning Location Network data indicated that <b>tweeks</b> observed were generated by lightning's located in the partial eclipse area of Asia-Oceania region. The changes in D-region ionospheric VLF reflection height and electron density (similar to 22 - 23 cm(- 3)) during eclipse have been estimated from the first cut-off frequency of the <b>tweeks.</b> The reflection height increased from similar to 89 km from the first occurrence of <b>tweek</b> to about 91 - 92 km at the totality and then decreased to similar to 87 km {{at the end of the}} eclipse, suggesting a change of about 5 km in the reflection height during eclipse. The reflection heights are lower by 2 - 3 km as compared to normal nighttime <b>tweek</b> reflection heights.
