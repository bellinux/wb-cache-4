5|$|The western mid-stream pier was rebuilt in 1804. Further {{alteration}} {{took place}} in 1895, when the western pavilion was moved {{for the construction of}} the Grand Parade. The appearance changed yet again when the current weir, the scene of Javert's suicide in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Les Misérables, was constructed between 1968 and 1972 as part of a flood-prevention scheme. Further restoration was undertaken in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Although Murphy was {{initially}} reluctant {{to appear as}} himself in To Hell and Back, <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his book, he eventually agreed to do so. Terry Murphy portrayed his brother Joseph Preston Murphy at age four. The film was directed by Jesse Hibbs with an on-screen introduction by General Walter Bedell Smith. Susan Kohner, daughter of Murphy's agent Paul Kohner, made her acting debut in the film. The finale shows Murphy being awarded the Medal of Honor while images of his unit's casualties pass across the screen.

5|$|Manne {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was {{released}} in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. The film débuted at number one {{at the box office}} and held that position for two weeks. It made a total of $796.7million worldwide, which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind Shrek 2. However, among all eight entries in the Harry Potter franchise, Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the lowest. The film ranks at number 471 in Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the novel}} {{has not been}} the only movie to have a {{character}} borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode's similar hairstyle in The Incredibles has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour's last name homophonous with 'Winter', while Sommers' is homophonous with 'Summer'.|$|E
5|$|The other {{theory to}} gain support {{was that it}} was viral {{marketing}} to promote an upcoming movie or video game. A Redditor noted that <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Dan Brown's novel Inferno was beginning production at that time for a late 2016 release. In the story, a rich villain makes a video warning of his plans to release a virus in order to reduce population growth.

50|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein {{personally}} oversaw <b>the</b> <b>film</b> {{to prevent}} <b>the</b> studio from making {{changes of the}} kind that were then typical of stage-to-film musical adaptations - such as putting in new songs by different composers.

50|$|Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror (1922) was <b>the</b> first <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Dracula. Although it {{followed}} the same basic plot as the novel, names were changed: Van Helsing is Professor Bulwer and appears only in a few scenes. Unlike the book, he is a friend <b>of</b> Thomas Hutter (<b>the</b> <b>film's</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Jonathan Harker) before he meets Count Orlok (a renamed Count Dracula) and never meets the vampire face to face.|$|R
5|$|Among {{her most}} famous roles were Anna Leonowens in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and {{opposite}} Cary Grant as his shipboard romantic interest Terri McKay in the bittersweet love story An Affair to Remember (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle {{for a romantic}} comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of}} the cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
5|$|Evancho saw <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the musical}} The Phantom of the Opera and liked {{it so much}} that her mother {{purchased}} the DVD; Evancho began singing the songs at home. Her parents have said that they did not recognize that her voice was unusual until her first talent competition, which she entered just before her 8th birthday. In the competition, Kean Idol, Evancho finished in second place. She began taking voice lessons and singing at various events, churches and nursing homes, mostly in Pennsylvania.

5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her {{time and money to}} helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the limited}} series Green Hornet: Parallel Lives by writer Jai Nitz, {{will serve as}} a prequel to the 2011 Green Hornet <b>film,</b> {{exploring}} <b>the</b> backstory for <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Kato.|$|R

5|$|In 1997 Hollywood {{producers}} {{were working}} on developing a film version of To the Stars. Producers Barbara Boyle and Michael Taylor were preparing to bring the book to the film screen for Touchstone Pictures, a division of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Boyle and Taylor had previously worked with actor John Travolta on the film Phenomenon, and the project was planned {{to be part of}} Travolta's vision to make films out of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novels. Hubbard's novel Battlefield Earth was first on his list, and Travolta starred in and helped fund <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the book which was released in 2000. A film version of To the Stars had not yet begun production as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less {{for the remainder of}} the decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was {{released}} in 1984 and starred Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. A year later, in 1985, Atari Games capitalized on the franchise by releasing the initial version of the game on arcade machine. This version was a platform and fighting game and featured theme music and sound clips from the actual film. The game takes place over three zones {{that are based on}} the movie's plot, where the objective is to free the slave children and recover the Sankara stones. This version was also the first translated from any of the movies in the Indiana Jones series into an arcade game, although Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600 and Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom for the Commodore 64 had come out in 1982 and 1985 respectively.|$|E
