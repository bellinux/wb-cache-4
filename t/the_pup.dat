5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, New Zealand carried two aircraft, a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter, on flying-off ramps fitted {{on top of}} 'P' and 'Q' turrets. <b>The</b> <b>Pup</b> was {{intended}} to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common, and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant.|$|E
50|$|The {{day before}} the competition, Bodi sends his pups to {{a day in the}} spa, but after <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> finish, a man wearing a spa worker's uniform takes them, along with an Australian dog who was also part of the competition. The evil man is Henkles, Hans's helper. He locks the four of them away with two big German Shepherds who were pretending they were going to eat <b>the</b> <b>pups.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> get scared, but the shepherds say that they were only messing with them. They help <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> escape by using a sort of seesaw which <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> made: one pup would be on one side while one of the shepherds would jump onto the other so that <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> would fly away. All four escape and return to Bodi's home, though they are very dirty. He cleans all four of them and grandpa calls the Australian dog's owner, so that dog goes home.|$|R

40|$|Serotonin:acetyl {{coenzyme}} A N-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 5) Activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats {{which were}} born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N-Acetyltransferase activity in <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> raised under diurnal lighting showed a rhythmic pattern, with high enzyme activity during dark period. <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> raised in continuous darkness also showed a rhythmic pattern, the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 -week-old pups; the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase began in the evening in 12 -day-old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every week. <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every week. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> were born, their pups again showed a rhythmic pattern. These observations indicate that the biological clock for N-acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the rhythmic pattern in their pups was inverted 180 degrees from that of pups born of diurnal mothers. When <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase in <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> {{was similar to that}} of their mothers. It is suggested that in the absence of light-darkness cycle, the mother rat sets the rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> to synchronize with her own rhythm. When pups were reared by a foster mother with a different rhythmic pattern from that of their original mother, the rhythmic phase in <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> was closer to that of the original mother, suggesting that the original mother plays the predominant role setting the rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>pups...</b>|$|R
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{pinnipeds}} have fur coats, {{the exception}} being the walrus, {{which is only}} sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most land mammals. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species molt; phocids molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only {{a thin layer of}} blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued <b>the</b> <b>pup.</b> Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5000|$|The average dog book {{refers to}} dogs as [...] "den dwelling" [...] animals and presumes that {{confining}} imparts {{a feeling of}} security to a puppy. Dogs, in fact, are not den dwelling animals, although {{in a variety of}} canids the dam will construct a nest (often underground) for <b>the</b> <b>pups.</b> <b>The</b> nest is a defense against predators and protection against inclement weather. <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> use it as a [...] "home base" [...] from which they explore, investigate and play. There is no door on the den which encloses <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> for many hours.|$|R
50|$|Rats {{that are}} {{raised in a}} laboratory, or are bred for selling purposes, are usually weaned {{at the age of}} 3 weeks. If <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> were left with their mother then weaning would not occur until they were older. This can have some health and {{behavioral}} benefits in the rats. The main reason that pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age is because often the mother is pregnant again, especially in a laboratory setting or if owned by a rat breeder, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> must be weaned off the mother before the next litter is born. By doing this it will prevent trampling of <b>the</b> <b>pups,</b> as well as over crowding, which can easily, especially if the mother is being kept in a monogamous pairs. Generally <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are separated by sex when weaning occurs, but are never housed alone. After weaning has begun, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> should be fed a supplemented diet for at least a month, but can be done up to 13 weeks.|$|R
50|$|Baikal seal pups are weaned after 2-2.5 months, {{occasionally}} up to 3.5 months. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> {{can increase}} their birth weight five-fold. After <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are weaned, <b>the</b> mother introduces them to solid food, bringing amphipods, fish, and other food into the den.|$|R
5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped <b>the</b> <b>pup</b> he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

500|$|Coyote pups {{are born}} in dens, hollow trees, or under ledges, and weigh [...] at birth. They are altricial, and are {{completely}} dependent on milk {{for their first}} 10 days. The incisors erupt at about 12 days, the canines at 16, and the second premolars at 21. Their eyes open after 10 days, by which point <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> become increasingly more mobile, walking by 20 days, and running {{at the age of}} six weeks. The parents begin supplementing <b>the</b> <b>pup's</b> diet with regurgitated solid food after 12–15 days. By the age of four to six weeks, when their milk teeth are fully functional, <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are given small food items such as mice, rabbits, or pieces of ungulate carcasses, with lactation steadily decreasing after two months. Unlike wolf pups, coyote pups begin seriously fighting (as opposed to play fighting) prior to engaging in play behavior. A common play behavior includes the coyote [...] "hip-slam". By three weeks of age, coyote pups bite each other with less inhibition than wolf <b>pups.</b> By <b>the</b> age of four to five weeks, pups have established dominance hierarchies, and are by then more likely to play rather than fight. The male plays an active role in feeding, grooming, and guarding <b>the</b> <b>pups,</b> but abandons them if the female goes missing before <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> are completely weaned. The den is abandoned by June to July, and <b>the</b> <b>pups</b> follow their parents in patrolling their territory and hunting. Pups may leave their families in August, though can remain for much longer. <b>The</b> <b>pups</b> attain adult dimensions at eight months, and gain adult weight a month later.|$|R

25|$|A bonnethead, a type {{of small}} hammerhead shark, {{was found to have}} {{produced}} a pup, born live on 14 December 2001 at Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. <b>The</b> <b>pup</b> was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenic means. The shark pup was apparently killed by a stingray within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in <b>the</b> <b>pup.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pup</b> was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA ("automictic parthenogenesis").
