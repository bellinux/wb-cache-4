40|$|Abstract—Before {{designing}} safety- or mission-critical real-time systems, a {{specification of}} the required behavior of the system should be produced and reviewed by domain experts. After the system has been implemented, it should be thoroughly tested {{to ensure that it}} behaves correctly. This is best done using a monitor, a system that observes the behavior of a target system and reports if that behavior is consistent with the requirements. Such a monitor can be used both as an oracle during testing and as a supervisor during operation. Monitors should be based on the documented requirements of the system. If the target system is required to monitor or control real-valued quantities, then the requirements, which are expressed in terms of the monitored and controlled quantities, will allow a range of behaviors to account for errors and imprecision in observation and control of these quantities. Even if the controlled variables are discrete valued, the requirements must specify the <b>timing</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Because of the limitations of the devices used by the monitor to observe the environmental quantities, there is unavoidable potential for false reports, both negative and positive.

Additional criteria for the ground terminals will be to maintain clock sychronization with the system and burst time integrity to within a matter of nanoseconds, to process required order-fire information, to provide adaptive data scrambing, and to compensate for variations in the user input output data rates, and for changes in range in the satellite communications links resulting from satellite perturbations in orbit. To achieve the required adaptability of a ground terminal to the above mentioned variables, programmable building blocks can be developed that will meet all of these requirements. To maintain system synchronization, i. e., all bursted data arriving at the satellite within assigned TDMA windows, ground terminal transmit data rates and burst timing must be maintained within tight tolerances.

This capability allows LDPC-coded schemes to employ lower transmission energies than uncoded schemes, {{at the cost}} of introducing a significant processing energy consumption during LDPC decoding. Traditional energy-reduction techniques, such as voltage and clock scaling can be employed for reducing the LDPC decoder’s energy consumption.

40|$|Channel codes such as Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes may be {{employed}} in wireless communication schemes for correcting transmission errors. This tolerance to channel-induced transmission errors allows the communication schemes to achieve higher transmission throughputs, {{at the cost of}} requiring additional processing for performing LDPC decoding. However, this LDPC decoding operation is associated with a potentially inadequate processing throughput, which may constrain the attainable transmission throughput. In order to increase the processing throughput, the clock period may be reduced, albeit this is at the cost of potentially introducing timing errors. Previous research efforts have considered a paucity of solutions for mitigating the occurrence of timing errors in channel decoders, by employing additional circuitry for detecting and correcting these overclocking-induced timing errors. Against this background, in this paper we demonstrate that stochastic LDPC decoders (LDPC-SDs) are capable of exploiting their inherent error correction capability for correcting not only transmission errors, but also timing errors, even without the requirement for additional circuitry. Motivated by this, we provide the first comprehensive tutorial on LDPC-SDs. We also propose a novel design flow for timing-error-tolerant LDPC decoders. We use this to develop a timing error model for LDPC-SDs and investigate how their overall error correction performance is affected by overclocking. Drawing upon our findings, we propose a modified LDPC-SD, having an improved <b>timing</b> error <b>tolerance.</b> In a particular practical scenario, this modification eliminates the approximately 1 dB performance degradation that is suffered by an overclocked LDPC-SD without our modification, enabling the processing throughput to be increased by up to 69. 4 %, which is achieved without compromising the error correction capability or processing energy consumption of the LDPC-SD...|$|R
