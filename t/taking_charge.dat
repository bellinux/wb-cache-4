5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, <b>taking</b> <b>charge</b> of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E

When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E

5|$|After the 1954 World Cup, the {{selection}} committee resumed their duties, continuing until {{the appointment of}} Matt Busby in 1958.

Busby only took charge of two Scotland matches, but he did give a young Denis Law his first Scotland cap. In March 1959, Andy Beattie became Scotland manager for a second time. During his second spell as Scotland manager, Beattie combined those duties with managing a football club. He resigned in November 1960 in order to manage English club Nottingham Forest on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Following Tipu's fall, {{a part of}} {{the kingdom}} of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The {{remaining}} territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, Krishnaraja III, was installed on the throne with chief minister (Diwan) Purnaiah, who had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and Lt. Col. Barry Close <b>taking</b> <b>charge</b> as the British Resident. The British then took control of Mysore's foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. As Diwan, Purnaiah distinguished himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from service in 1811 (and died shortly thereafter) following the 16th birthday of the boy king.|$|E

Birmingham reached the 2001 Football League Cup Final under Trevor Francis, whose successor as permanent manager, Steve Bruce, twice achieved promotion to the Premier League. Birmingham won the League Cup for the second time under Alex McLeish in 2011. The 1966 World Cup-winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, took charge of the club briefly in 1977.|$|E

On 14 November 2005, Gannon confirmed his resignation from Dundalk after his position had been called into question as his chief supporters, vice-chairman Tom Baldwin and chief executive Sean Connolly, left the club. This left Dundalk without a manager for their final match of the 2005 season, {{in which they had}} already secured a comfortable mid-table position in Ireland's second tier of association football.

The final of the five, Frank Clark, saw out the season but did not last much longer, losing his job in February 1998 with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football. Joe Royle was unable to prevent relegation, but subsequently achieved successive promotions to restore top flight status, though relegation a year later resulted in his sacking.|$|E
