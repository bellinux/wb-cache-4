The various responses to this crisis of baselines will to a significant extent determine the future direction of nature conservation.

40|$|AbstractAs for {{extending}} real-valued continuous functions or continuous pseudometrics on a subspace to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> space, <b>notions</b> of z -, C∗ -, C -, P - and Pγ -embeddings are known. As {{a cardinal}} generalization of z -embedding, Blair defined in 1985 {{the notion of}} zγ -embedding with γ≥ω, where zω -embedding coincides with z -embedding. On the other hand, since Pω -embedding equals C -embedding, Pγ -embedding can be also regarded as a cardinal generalization of C -embedding. Recently Ohta asked if a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding can be defined so that this property plus Uω -embedding is equal to Pγ -embedding, and it is itself equals C∗ -embedding in case γ=ω. In this paper, we give a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding, called (P∗) γ -embedding, and answer this problem. As a characterization of (P∗) γ -embedding, we show that (P∗) γ -embedding naturally admits its description by using continuous maps from a subspace into the hedgehog with γ spines. We also give a new extension-like property called weak zγ -embedding, with which z - (respectively C∗ -, C - or Uω -) embedding equals zγ - (respectively (P∗) γ -, Pγ - or Uγ -) embedding...|$|R

It would permit Christ to be crucified if it was necessary to His Divine nature, but it would ask in the name of good taste why He could not be crucified in a private room. It would declare that the act of a martyr in being torn in pieces by lions was vulgar and sensational, though, of course, it would have no objection to being torn in pieces by a lion in one's own parlour before a circle of really intimate friends.|$|E

The Londoners liked Gloucester and hated the Woodvilles, and all belonging to them, and after some sermons and speeches of this sort, there were so many people inclined to take as their king the man rather than the boy, that the Duke of Buckingham led a deputation to request Richard to accept the crown in his nephew's stead.

60|$|Now it is {{this simple}} truth which, like many others, is too simple for our {{scientists}} to see. This is where they go wrong, not only about true religion, but about false religions too; so that their account of mythology is more mythical than the myth itself.

I say that even if Adonis was a god of vegetation, they have got <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>notion</b> of him wrong. Nobody, to begin with, is sufficiently interested in decaying vegetables, as such, to make any particular mystery or disguise about them; and certainly not enough to disguise them under the image of a very handsome young man, which is a vastly more interesting thing. If Adonis was connected with the fall of leaves in autumn and the return of flowers in spring, the process of thought was quite different. It is a process of thought which springs up spontaneously in all children and young artists; it springs up spontaneously in all healthy societies. It is very difficult to explain in a diseased society.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest {{in the concept of}} wellbeing in the academic literature. Likewise, Government strategies are increasingly being aligned with the promotion of positive mental health, as opposed to merely the treatment of illness. Experiencing wellbeing in later life has, however, been labelled by some as a ‘paradox’, as the conditions of older age are assumed to be negative and thus at odds with those which sustain wellbeing. On <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of wellbeing as applied to older adults has been defined by ‘experts’, and the small number of studies that have examined this from the perspective of older adults have often reduced this to the life domains which support or undermine quality of life. Therefore, in order to gain a richer understanding of this topic, the aim {{of this study was to}} further explore older adults’ perceptions and experience of wellbeing. In this qualitative study, a combination of narrative inquiry and photographic methods were used to elicit wellbeing stories from older adults. Thirteen participants aged 56 – 82 years took photographs of the factors they associated with their wellbeing, which they discussed in narrative interviews. Analysis of these data revealed that there were six ‘narrative types’ present in the stories told by participants; namely Continuity, Proactivity, Opportunity, Recovery, Acceptance and Disruption. These findings were considered in relation to the narrative elements of tone, plot, agency, temporality and pace. Comparisons were made between the six ‘narrative types’ and the ‘narrative of decline’ which is assumed to shape the stories told by older adults. It emerged that, on <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> narratives which were present in my study were positive in tone, had plots of stability or progression, displayed high levels of agency in the storytellers, were placed in the present and within a coherent life story, and revealed a busy pace of life. The ‘narrative of decline’ was found to have little influence over the stories which were told. In addition, it seemed that there may be a new ‘wellbeing’ narrative which is more pertinent to those in younger-old age. Thus my findings suggest that wellbeing can be experienced in later life and that the ‘narrative of decline’ should no longer be automatically cited as the one which shapes the stories older adults can tell about their lives...|$|R

[...] But I will go further, and confess my belief that the (so-called) Ebionites of the first and second centuries, who rejected the 'Christopædia', and whose Gospel commenced with the baptism by John, were orthodox Apostolic Christians, who received Christ as the Lord, that is, as Jehovah 'manifested in the flesh'.

To gratify Jansenius I waived this objection, and only interfered to save him from being fleeced and fooled by an unnecessary West End middleman, who, as likely as not, would have eventually employed the very man to whom I gave the job. Even the epitaph was not mine.
