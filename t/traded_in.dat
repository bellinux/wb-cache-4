40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, it {{examines}} the trend and nature of East Asian trade.

It shows that the increasing importance of East Asia as a trading region is due at least partially to the rising <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts. Next, it tries to find out if foreign direct investment plays a role in the import and export behavior of East Asian intra-regional trade. Using a gravity model, it evidences that in general FDI is important in explaining imports and exports of intra-East Asian <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> particular, FDI is especially important <b>in</b> explaining <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts, followed by <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> capital goods.
