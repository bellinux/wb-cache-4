5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two lines in <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{a few yards}} apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|During the protest, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured {{personnel carrier}} {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> By the end of the afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> regained their resolve and, as {{the body}} marched near Harrison and Frederick streets, they were {{attacked}} in the rear and made to halt by the pressing of <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Without orders, some soldiers fired on <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> killing one and wounding between one and three. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> shrank back and the soldiers were allowed continue until they had advanced to {{the offices of the}} newspaper, the Baltimore American, near Holliday Street, where an order was given to halt and two volleys fired into <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> They were forced to halt a third time as they turned onto Charles Street, and again fired on <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> near Light Street. There two men and one boy were killed. From there they followed Charles to Camden Street and on to the station.|$|E

30|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} “wisdom” of an average <b>crowd</b> member, <b>the</b> platform often leverages the wisdom of <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> by, for example, instituting a “provision point mechanism” such that project creators will not receive funds unless the target investment is reached (Agrawal et al. 2013; Belleflamme and Lambert 2014). Crowdfunding platforms allow individual investors to leverage the wisdom of <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> through observational learning (Zhang and Liu 2012), by highlighting the number of existing investors and overall progress towards the funding goal (Ahlers et al. 2015).

5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building.

Owing to their flexibility, their conformations are expected to be particularly sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> cellular environment. Here we use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to quantify <b>the</b> effect of <b>crowding</b> as mimicked by commonly used biocompatible polymers. We observe a compaction of IDPs not only with increasing concentration, but also with increasing size of <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> agents, at variance with the predictions from scaled-particle theory, the prevalent paradigm in the field. However, the observed behavior can be explained quantitatively if the polymeric nature of both the IDPs and <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> molecules is taken into account explicitly. Our results suggest that excluded volume interactions between overlapping biopolymers and the resulting criticality of the system can be essential contributions to the physics governing <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> cellular milieu...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and noise from <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> He dedicated the ball {{used to make}} the game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> was dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E
