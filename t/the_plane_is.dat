5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Briggs {{uses his}} CIA {{credentials}} to have Fisher {{sent to the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, allowing him to continue interrogating Nouri. Nouri confirms that Sadiq {{is head of the}} Engineers, and says that Sadiq knows the identities of the Fourth Echelon leaders. Escaping from the prison, Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> attacked by a Mexican drug cartel. Fourth Echelon restarts the plane with Kobin's help, and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York. He watches another {{man on the}} plane {{who seems to be}} following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when he comes back out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the head}} of Merpati stated that the spareparts delay and the tragedy of Flight 5601 was totally {{different}} and stated that if <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> flying at <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> airworthy.|$|R
50|$|Three of <b>the</b> Farman <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> christened Aetos, Gyps, and Ierax. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> {{paid for}} by money donated by a poet named Matsoukis.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{lifted off}} <b>the</b> runway, the C829 circuit breaker was closed, and {{the landing gear}} was extended, using the {{alternate}} system. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then towed to the LOT maintenance hangar, for repairs and further investigation.|$|R
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to {{find the}} pieces of the map {{scattered}} throughout the big City and bring them to him. Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> {{involved}} in <b>the</b> crash was a Yakovlev Yak-40 which bore a Russian registration of RA-87468. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> manufactured in Saratov Aviation Plant on 11 November 1974 with {{a serial number}} of 9441337. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> re-registered as CCCP-87468 and was {{handed over to the}} Ministry of Civil Aviation of the USSR. On November 16 <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> sent to <b>the</b> Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration. Fourteen years later, on 16 November 1988, the 87468 was operated by the Krasnoyarsk Civil Aviation Administration. Cheremshanka Airlines later retrieved <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> on 1993.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then sold to a private owner in 2013 registered XA-MHA.|$|R
50|$|He was {{drifting}} {{and sitting}} {{out on the}} floats. All of a sudden <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> gave a big jerk and knocked him off <b>the</b> floats. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> towed off and he barely made it to shore. He walked for miles while <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> towed around <b>the</b> lake.|$|R
5|$|The {{events of}} the game see Sonic and Tails chasing Robotnik through West Side Island, and {{eventually}} up to the Death Egg, pursuing him with Tails' biplane, the Tornado. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> damaged after being shot at, but Sonic still manages to infiltrate the Death Egg, alone. Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant mech. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic {{falls to the ground}} and is saved by Tails in the Tornado. If the player has collected all of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic, in his Super Sonic form, flies alongside it.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{shot down}} mid-air, {{separating}} Nate from Elena when they parachute out. He tracks {{her to an}} old fort controlled by pirates led by Eddy Raja (James Sie), an old enemy of Drake's working for Roman who traps him and demands that he help him find the treasure. Elena arrives in a stolen jeep and breaks him out, but {{they are unable to}} outrun Eddy's men. Stalling for time, Nate manages to drive the jeep over a cliff and into a lake surrounding the colony's port. Tired, injured, and grieving Sully's death, Nate decides to give up and return home. Elena convinces him to see Drake's work through, and the two work together to reach the crumbling customs house, where Nate is able to trace the statue to an inland monastery. While on reconnaissance, they discover that Roman has also found the statue with help from the supposedly-dead Sully. While in pursuit, Elena falls through a bridge and reluctantly discards her camera so that Nate can save her. Nate subsequently catches up to Sully and accuses him of betrayal, to which Sully reveals that he was only pretending to help, having survived Roman's bullet because of Drake's notebook in his shirt's breast-pocket preventing a fatal wound.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of various {{characters}} during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the heads up display, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner. The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> destroyed. The main campaign features 30 collectible pieces of intel that award the player with game cheats and visual filters such as infinite ammunition, cluster grenades, and increased contrast.|$|E
5000|$|Later <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} a short time by an Aviation Club of the PWS factory. It took part in some {{competitions}} in Poland, without much success, only in June 1933 J. Szałowski won the 3rd place in PWS-50 in the 1st Flight of North-Western Poland. During a contest in autumn 1930 <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> damaged and later repaired. In 1932 <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> received a name [...] "Podlasianka" [...] (a female of Podlasie region). In late June 1933 <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> damaged in a crash in Warsaw, and then was broken up.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.|$|R
50|$|Footage {{from the}} crash site, {{taken from a}} helicopter, shown that the front part of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{completely}} destroyed. <b>The</b> empennage of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> crushed severely while the tail was relatively intact. Dead bodies, alongside with their belongings, were strewn in a large grassy area near the wreckage of <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R
25|$|In topology, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} {{as being the}} unique contractible 2-manifold.|$|E
25|$|The Moser spindle, a seven-vertex graph used {{to provide}} a lower bound for the {{chromatic}} number of <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>is</b> claw-free.|$|E
25|$|In polar coordinates, {{every point}} of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} by its distance r from {{the origin and}} its angle θ from the polar axis.|$|E
50|$|Examination on the {{wreckage}} of Flight 812 concluded that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> didn't break up in flight, as the debris of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>were</b> concentrated in a specific area, rather than dispersed. The NTSB didn't find engine malfunctions, and added that they didn't find evidence that may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> not airworthy.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> ready. Andrew Baird was ready.|$|R
50|$|A general {{rotation}} is not simple, and has {{the maximum}} number of planes of rotation as given above. In the general case the angles of rotations in these <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> distinct and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> uniquely defined. If any of the angles are the same then <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> not unique, as in four dimensions with an isoclinic rotation.|$|R
25|$|Due to this construction, the Fano {{plane is}} {{considered}} to be a Desarguesian plane, even though <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> too small to contain a non-degenerate Desargues configuration (which requires 10 points and 10 lines).|$|E
25|$|In early July 2008, Flybe International {{announced}} {{the naming of}} one of their new Bombardier Q400 aircraft in honour of Keegan's service to Newcastle United, both as a player and as manager. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> used on the regular service from Newcastle International Airport to London's Gatwick Airport.|$|E
25|$|In more {{familiar}} terms, if ' is the contact lift of a curve ' in the plane, then the preferred cycle at each {{point is the}} osculating circle. In other words, after taking contact lifts, much of the basic theory of curves in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> Lie invariant.|$|E
50|$|Any two ternary {{rings of}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> isomorphic.|$|R
25|$|Drawings on {{surfaces}} {{other than}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> also studied.|$|R
50|$|By 1941 <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> ostensibly {{assigned}} {{to defend the}} Manfred-Weiss plant, but were actually used for training. When the Allied bomber raids started {{in the spring of}} 1944 <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> no longer airworthy, and it appears all were destroyed in a massive raid on the Budapest-Ferihegy airport on 9 August.|$|R
25|$|West and Watson argued as {{well over}} lesser issues, such as state aid for {{municipal}} sewer projects, a state college for Rock Hill, and anti-pollution guidelines. Watson vowed if elected {{to sell the}} $600,000 governor's jet, which cost more than $150,000 per year to operate, but West countered that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> needed for industrial recruitment.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of the plane in space, precisely {{the attitude of the}} plane (or alternately the rotation, geometric orientation or gradient of <b>the</b> <b>plane),</b> <b>is</b> associated with the ratio of the bivector components. In particular the three basis bivectors, e23, e31 and e12, or scalar multiples of them, are associated with the yz-plane, xz-plane and xy-plane respectively.|$|E
25|$|Another {{piece of}} public {{art is a}} Hawker Hunter jet fighter mounted on a pole roughly ten metres tall {{situated}} outside the Big Apple family entertainment complex. This is the last Hunter built and was used to promote the previous Planets family entertainment complex. Originally black, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> now finished in all-over silver.|$|E
