5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began <b>to</b> <b>strangle</b> Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
