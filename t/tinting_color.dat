5000|$|Product dyeing, {{also known}} as garment dyeing, {{is the process of}} dyeing {{products}} such as hosiery, sweaters, and carpet after they have been produced. This stage of dyeing is suitable when all components dye the same shade (including threads). This method is used to dye sheer hosiery since it is knitted using tubular knitting machines and then stitched prior to dyeing. Tufted carpets, with the exception of carpets produced using solution dyed fibers, are often dyed after they have been tufted. This method is not suitable for apparel with many components such as lining, zippers, and sewing thread, as each component may dye differently. The exception is tinting jeans with pigments for a “vintage” look. In <b>tinting,</b> <b>color</b> is used, whereas in other treatments such as acid-wash and stone-wash, chemical or mechanical processes are used. After garment construction, these products are given the [...] "faded" [...] or [...] "used" [...] look by finishing methods as opposed to dyeing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} {{preparation of}} color separations, a red keyline {{on the black}} line art marked the outline of solid or <b>tint</b> <b>color</b> areas. In some cases a black keyline was used when it served as both a color indicator and an outline to be printed in black. Because usually the black plate contained the keyline, the K in CMYK represents the keyline or black plate, also sometimes called the key plate.|$|R
50|$|As Portrait of Jennie was a fantasy, Selznick {{insisted on}} filming on actual Massachusetts (The Graves Light) and New York City {{locations}} (Central Park, The Cloisters, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art) {{as opposed to}} studio sets, which dramatically increased the film's production costs. The film's major overhaul came when Selznick added a <b>tinted</b> <b>color</b> sequence for the final scenes. The final shot of the painting, appearing just before the credits, is in full Technicolor.|$|R

500|$|The {{game was}} not commercially successful; later sources have termed it as [...] "arousing {{little more than}} controversy", though one source claims it sold 3,000 units. In {{addition}} to the main black-and-white game, limited runs were produced of a <b>tinted</b> <b>color</b> version and a true multi-color version of the game; the latter {{is believed to be}} the first color arcade game. Gotcha inspired an enhanced version featuring cops and robbers titled Maze Craze for the Atari 2600 in 1977, which was more popular than the original.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{industry}} is a highly energy consuming process which also facing huge challenges as the global demand of paper products constantly decreasing. Therefore, the importance of energy optimizing the process {{becomes more and more}} crucial. The purpose of this work was to contribute to the energy optimization work at Kvarnsveden paper mill in Borlänge by mapping the energy consumption and analyzing particular areas with potential of optimization. Furthermore, analysis of the process parameters <b>tinting</b> <b>colors,</b> moisture profile and the pulp refiners in order to decrease the material losses were performed. The results from the analysis of <b>tinting</b> <b>colors</b> and moisture profiles provided the operators with reference intervals which stated how to run the parameters in order to produce paper of approved quality. The purpose of analyzing the refiners was to investigate if the quality of the mass could be predicted by specific energy instead of Freeness and average fiber length, which is the method used today. The result of this analysis shows that this is not possible today. However, specific energy is a valuable parameter in order to predict process malfunctions. The result of the energy mapping shows that the total specific energy consumption to produce one ton paper is 4, 1 MWh/ton. Furthermore the energy mapping shows that every ton of paper that doesn’t clear the quality control and has to be re-produced consumes additional 1, 3 MWh/ton of energy, which means that the total amount of energy for reproduced paper is 5, 4 MWh. The amount of energy that is necessary to re-produce shows the importance of producing quality approved paper the first time, and since PM 12 is capable of producing 1 ton/min at normal operating speed, the amount of paper that has to be re-produced can increase very fast. Hopefully, the results from the analysis of <b>tinting</b> <b>colors</b> and moisture profile will contribute to a decreased amount of papers that has to be re-produced. Furthermore the energy mapping shows some areas with energy optimization potential. Partly by maintenance and repairs of heat exchangers and steam condensers and partly by terminate the heating of buildings that has no use in the production today. ...|$|R

5000|$|Venetian plaster can be <b>tinted,</b> or <b>colored</b> using {{natural or}} {{synthetic}} colorants. The ability to tint Venetian plaster is especially helpful when a specific color of [...] "marble" [...] is desired, {{or when a}} color that does not exist naturally is wanted.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} tinting was laborious, {{although}} simple in principle. Editing {{was done in}} rolls based on <b>tint</b> <b>color,</b> with numbered frames of film in between scenes for later assembly. Once these rolls were printed and processed from the negative, they were immersed in aniline dyes, specified to the colors that were listed in the script or continuity. Hardening fixer was not used on the film {{in order for the}} dye to be imbibed into the emulsion quicker and with better results. Once the film had dried on large film drums, it would be assembled in correct order and rewound onto reels for shipping. Toning was similar, but instead of aniline dyes, the film was immersed in chemicals to change the silver image into colored salts.|$|R

5|$|In an August 3, 1973, {{memo to the}} Atari {{engineering}} department, co-founder Nolan Bushnell {{laid out}} plans {{for the company to}} create a prototype 20-player version of Gotcha in time for a trade show later that year, though no such game was ever made. Instead, released {{at the same time as}} Gotcha and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a <b>tinted</b> <b>color</b> overlay, and a true multi-color version of Gotcha with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|R
50|$|The façade was {{originally}} {{decorated with a}} cornice of feigned battlements, its surface smoothly stuccoed and decorated with geometric designs of highly colorful imitation marbles, which have been lost, lending a somewhat dour public face to Palazzo Schifanoia {{that was not what}} Borso d'Este intended. The rich white marble entrance door survives, though its <b>tinted</b> <b>colors</b> have weathered away and art historians disagree whether it is to be attributed to the painter-designer Francesco del Cossa or to Biagio Rossetti. Above the arched door, flanked by pilasters, the Este arms are displayed and the unicorn, a symbol of ducal benevolence and the source of patronage. In 1493 the terracotta cornice was added to designs by Biagio Rossetti, who was also commissioned by Ercole I d'Este to extend the palace.|$|R

50|$|A Translight or Translite {{is a large}} {{illuminated}} film backing {{typically used}} as a backdrop in the film and TV industry. The name of Translite originally came from the black-and-white display film made by the Eastman Kodak Company. Pacific Studios in Los Angeles was the sole producer of Translites from about 1950 until about 1979. Technicians there projected images in a darkroom onto the film in strips, which were then removed and processed by hand in tanks by the darkroom crew. The strips were seamed with tape; then oil paint {{was applied to the}} assembled picture for a <b>tinted</b> <b>color</b> effect. The name gradually was applied to any transparency lit from behind and used as a background picture for feature films or television production. Full-color printing of a Translight was first used on the motion picture One from the Heart.|$|R

The 40th Anniversary special editions were different in the Japan and North American markets. The Japanese version came in Marble White as an homage to the Mazda Cosmo Sport, which was initially only available in white. The North American version came in Metropolitan Grey Mica exterior with the interior clad in special Cosmo Red leather. It also had wheels of a new design that were later incorporated in the 2009 facelift, however the <b>tinted</b> <b>color</b> of the wheels remained exclusive to the 40th Anniversary Edition. Exclusive sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein dampers were added along with an enhanced urethane foam injected front cross member intended to improve steering feel. In North America, this special edition was available only in 2008.|$|R
