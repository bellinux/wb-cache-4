40|$|In a plain-vanilla New Keynesian {{model with}} two-period {{staggered}} price-setting, discretionary monetary policy leads to multiple equilibria. Complementarity between pricing decisions of forward-looking firms underlies the multiplicity, which is intrinsically dynamic in nature. At each point in time, <b>the</b> discretionary monetary <b>authority</b> optimally accommodates <b>the</b> level of predetermined prices when setting {{the money supply}} because it is concerned solely about real activity. Hence, if other firms set a high price in the current period, an individual firm will optimally choose a high price because it knows that <b>the</b> monetary <b>authority</b> <b>next</b> period will accommodate with a high money supply. Under commitment, the mechanism generating complementarity is absent: <b>the</b> monetary <b>authority</b> commits not to respond to future predetermined prices. Multiple equilibria also arise in other similar contexts where (i) a policymaker cannot commit, and (ii) forward-looking agents determine a state variable to which future policy responds.
