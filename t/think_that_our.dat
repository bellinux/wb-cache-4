25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E

[...] Significantly, even the keyboard parts are played live in the studio, with The Quietus noting that the [...] "interplay between electronics and amps is comparatively untouchable."

2500|$|On 25 August 2005, Eitam {{was quoted}} as {{explaining}} that the reason there was no violence was not the security forces, but the settlers' own restraint and decision not to use violence. Eitam rebuked those {{who said that the}} settlers didn't use violence because they were afraid from the multitude of officers, and said: [...] "We were not afraid from the multitude of cops and horses, it is ridiculous to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> people, with swift boys, war-though men and its wives and men are scorned by mortar shells, explosive charges and graves, will be afraid of physical confrontation with the cops.

2500|$|However, {{the fact}} that it was likely that Northern Ireland would choose not to remain part of the Irish Free State after its {{foundation}} and remain in the United Kingdom, gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were [...] "glad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> decision [...] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack." [...] Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick's Saltire in favour of a new flag derived from the coat-of-arm of the Burkes, Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England's St George's Cross.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Luther {{also took}} note of the {{similarities}} between Islam and Protestantism in the rejection of idols, although he noted Islam was much more drastic in its complete rejection of images. In On War against the Turk, Luther is actually less critical of the Turks than he is of the Pope, whom he calls an anti-Christ, or the Jews, whom he describes as [...] "the Devil incarnate". He urges his contemporaries to also see the good aspects in the Turks, and refers to some who were favourable to the Ottoman Empire, and [...] "who actually want the Turk to come and rule, because they <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> German people are wild and uncivilized - indeed that they are half-devil and half-man".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 RTL interview, Le Pen {{stated that}} her {{strategy}} {{was not about}} changing the FN's program but about showing it as it really is, instead of the image given to it by the media in the previous decades. The media and her political adversaries are accused of spreading an [...] "unfair, wrong and caricatural" [...] image of the National Front. She refuses the qualification of far-right or extreme-right, considering it a [...] "pejorative" [...] term: [...] "How am I party of the extreme right? ... I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> propositions are extreme propositions, whatever the subject". However, the radical far-right (e.g., Minute, Rivarol, Patrick Buisson, Henry de Lesquen) reproached her for abandoning or softening her stances on immigration, gay marriage and abortion. In her speech in Lyon on 10 December 2010, she mentioned the fate of gays living in difficult neighbourhoods, victims of religious laws replacing the republican law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the study were {{politically}} sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications {{on the eve of a}} contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq.

He struggled on despite rarely being able to write free of stomach pains for more than twenty minutes at a stretch, and made drastic revisions which left Murray with a huge £72 bill for corrections. Murray upped the print run to 1,250 copies, with a publication date in November. A copy was sent to Lyell, with a [...] "foolishly anxious" [...] Darwin hoping that he would [...] "come round". An eager Lyell gave Darwin [...] "very great kudos", though he was still concerned that [...] "the dignity of man is at stake".

2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E
