Yūhei, who stays at Seishu despite having {{been on the}} former first-string team, moves in with Ko's family after the first-stringers' {{dormitory}} is closed.

5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following {{an analysis of the}} germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E

25|$|Dan <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{explain how}} the spirit of anger works. It covers your eyes, and distorts your vision. Through this you do not {{recognise}} people for who they really are. In the case of Joseph, Dan speaks from experience. Furthermore, it disturbs the mind so that the Lord departs from it and Beliar inhabits it.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} {{argues that}} Judah {{had sex with}} Tamar and his wife due to drunkenness, and that he bribed his wife's father {{in order to be}} allowed to marry her. It <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> instruct that the role of a king is lesser than that of a priest, and that Levi is more important, clearly pointing to the theocratic attitude of the author.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{reaching}} 50 runs in an innings {{is known}} as a half-century; if the batsman <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> score a century, the half-century is succeeded in statistics by the century.

25|$|Maimonides, one of Judaism's most {{important}} theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus {{was wrong to}} create Christianity and why Muhammad was wrong to create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say that both faiths {{can be considered a}} positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{encyclical}} {{opens with}} an assertion of the competency of the magisterium of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should {{limit the number}} of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in procreation. Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{has made}} few fictional appearances, {{but she is}} a major {{character}} in Graham Shelby's The Knights of Dark Renown (1969) and its sequel The Kings of Vain Intent (1970). Shelby idealises her marriage to Humphrey, depicting them as his young romantic leads. He <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> depict her being beaten and raped by Conrad in a sadistically abusive relationship. This sensationalist depiction is not supported by any evidence. Shelby implies that Isabella plotted Conrad's murder in revenge for his abuse, and depicts her as mentally numbed and indifferent to Henry.|$|E

25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries <b>then</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government}} to issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E

At the story’s end the Avengers consider reviving Barton by placing his brain patterns {{in the body of the}} android Vision.|$|E

A golden age ensued where the Æsir had plenty of gold and happily constructed temples and made tools. But then three mighty giant maidens came from Jötunheimr and the golden age came to an end. The Æsir then created the dwarves, of whom Mótsognir and Durinn are the mightiest.|$|E
