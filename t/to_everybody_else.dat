25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

Andrés {{maintains}} his friendship with two high-school classmates: Benjamín [...] "Tuca" [...] Pardo (Mex Urtizberea) and Verónica Diorio (Julieta Ortega), who runs a radio station which plays 1980s Argentine rock music. María Laura keeps {{in touch with her}} best friend in high school: psychiatrist Victoria Lauría (Paola Barrientos), a single woman looking for a couple with whom to have a surrogate child. Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro), another classmate, takes a job at McCan and comes out during a meeting of the graduates. Clemente's wife Patricia is, unknown <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> another classmate. Obese at school, she lost weight and changed her face and name.|$|E
2500|$|Self-esteem is {{important}} because it shows ourselves how we view the way we are and the sense of our personal value. [...] Thus, it affects the way we are and act {{in the world and the}} way we are related <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the June 2006 {{issue of}} Ladies' Home Journal, {{she said she}} still loved Cruise: [...] "He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> he is huge. But he was lovely to me and I loved him. I still love him." [...] In addition, she has {{expressed}} shock about their divorce. In 2015, former Church of Scientology executive Mark Rathbun claimed in a documentary film that he was instructed to [...] "facilitate [...] breakup with Nicole Kidman". Cruise's auditor further claimed Kidman had been wiretapped on Cruise's suggestion.|$|E
2500|$|Conservative {{columnist}} Charles Krauthammer {{argued that}} between $60–200 {{billion per year}} could be saved through tort reform. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform {{is not part of}} the bills under consideration: [...] "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruise met {{his second}} wife, actress Nicole Kidman, {{on the set}} of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella and Connor Antony. In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The {{pregnancy}} ended with a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, [...] "It was wrongly reported," [...] and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy. Before Kidman's next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: [...] "He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him." ...|$|E

6000|$|This {{explanation}} was, of course, ample. [...] "Midnight," [...] repeated everybody <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> [...] "is exactly midday in Allahabad."

5000|$|John Wemmick {{is a bill}} {{collector}} for {{the lawyer}} Mr Jaggers. The job requires a demanding, uncaring attitude, a personality the working Wemmick takes on. To impress {{and stay in the}} favour of his boss, Mr Jaggers, he berates Jaggers's clients with disdain. He is described as having [...] "the same air of knowing something <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> disadvantage, as his master had". His professional attitude contrasts with Wemmick's more outwardly pleasant home and personal life. Jaggers was a self centered man who did not seem to pay Wemmick well, and when Pip tried to buy a boat he had made fun of him, calling the young boy poor.|$|R
50|$|Axel's {{left arm}} gets trapped under {{rocks in the}} cave-in at the end.

60|$|But {{perhaps you}} would say that his adulatory manner was {{originally}} adopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly over-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the unreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf will shout <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
60|$|Betty {{continued}} to regard him steadfastly. The shock {{of his words}} had to some extent numbed her. At this moment she was merely thinking, quite dispassionately, what a singularly nasty little man he looked, and wondering--not for the first time--what strange quality, invisible <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> {{it had been in}} him that had made her mother his adoring slave during the whole of their married life.|$|E
5000|$|The Nazis {{entered this}} war under the rather childish {{delusion}} {{that they were}} going <b>to</b> bomb <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, and half a hundred other places, they put that rather naïve theory into operation. They sowed the wind, and now, they are going to reap the whirlwind.|$|R
60|$|The {{friend of}} the family was in that stage of tender passion which bound him <b>to</b> regard <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> as the foe of the family. He put the round head of his cane in his mouth, like a stopper, when he sat down. As if he felt himself full to the throat with affronting sentiments. And he eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes.|$|R
60|$|If I {{had been}} an ancient Briton, I would not have {{contented}} myself with blue paint, but I would have bankrupted the rainbow. I so enjoy gay clothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me when I go to the opera to see that, while women look like a flower-bed, the men are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress. These are two or three reasons why I wish to wear white clothes: When I find myself in assemblies like this, with everybody in black clothes, I know I possess something that is superior <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's.</b> Clothes are never clean. You don't know whether they are clean or not, because you can't see.|$|R

6000|$|When he went home, at two, he {{was fully}} {{a member of}} the Bunch, and all the week {{thereafter}} he was bound by the exceedingly straitened conventions, the exceedingly wearing demands, of their life of pleasure and freedom. He had to go to their parties; he was involved in the agitation when everybody telephoned <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> that she hadn't meant what she'd said when she'd said that, and anyway, why was Pete going around saying she'd said it? ...|$|E

5000|$|Later in 2015, {{reacting}} to an ordinance in Houston, Texas {{that would have}} permitted those who are transgender to enter a bathroom designated for the gender with which they identify, Carson proposed the idea of transgender bathrooms, saying: [...] "It is not fair for them <b>to</b> make <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> uncomfortable. ...

6000|$|... 'Upon my life,' says Mortimer languidly, 'I find it immensely {{embarrassing}} {{to have the}} eyes of Europe upon me to this extent, and my only consolation is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in your secret hearts when you find, as you inevitably will, the man from Somewhere a bore.

6000|$|... "Of course {{hard times}} came to Mr. Weasel at last, just as <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> but they didn't worry him much. You see, {{he knew all}} about the secret hiding-places in which some of his neighbors had stored away food, so when he was hungry, {{all he had to}} do was to help himself. So Mr. Weasel became a thief, and still no one {{suspected}} him. Now one bad habit almost always leads to another. Mr. Weasel developed a great fondness for eggs. Our whole family has always had rather a weakness that way." ...|$|E
60|$|Business led me out {{sometimes}} {{to the other}} end of the town, even when the sickness was chiefly there. And as the thing was new to me, as well as <b>to</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> it was a most surprising thing to see those streets, which were usually so thronged, now grown desolate, and so few people to be seen in them, that if I had been a stranger, and at a loss for my way, I might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street, I mean of the by-streets, and see[38] nobody to direct me, except watchmen set at the doors of such houses as were shut up; of which I shall speak presently.|$|E
50|$|In {{a lot of}} my work I’m {{trying to}} make a {{commentary}} about humans encroaching on nature through their presence. But I’m not so naïve as to think that my own presence is not an impact on the animals and plants and landscapes that I happen to enter. What I can do as a photographer, hopefully, is <b>to</b> help <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> see their impact in a way that maybe they hadn’t before.|$|R
5000|$|John Leonard of The New York Times said, [...] "Morgan, like a novelist, wants <b>to</b> be <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> {{in order}} <b>to</b> look at himself through {{innocent}} eyes, to be charmed....Miss Tyler, witty, civilized, curious, with her radar ears and her quill pen dipped on one page in acid {{and on the}} next in orange liqueur, is asking whether art is adequate to the impersonations life insists on, death absolves. She is a wonderful writer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} much about it before, but now dying doesn't seem dreadful at all--only solemn and beautiful. Somehow <b>everybody</b> seems <b>to</b> love <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> more for it, {{and try to be}} kind and good and pious. I can't say what I mean, but you know, mother;" [...] and Frank went pacing on again with the bright look his eyes always wore when he listened to music or read of some noble action.|$|R
