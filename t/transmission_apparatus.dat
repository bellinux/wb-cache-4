40|$|Performance {{assessment}} and large-scale monitoring of terrestrial {{digital video broadcasting}} (DVB-T) <b>transmission</b> <b>apparatuses</b> are currently a pressing need due to {{the rapid growth of}} related broadcasting networks in many countries. Power measurements, in particular, play a very important role since RF and IF signal power, RF channel power, RF and IF power spectrum, noise (or unwanted) power, and power efficiency are relevant parameters to be measured as accurately as possible. Although modern spectrum analyzers and high-performance vector signal analyzers exhibit satisfying accuracy and repeatability, their cost, weight, and size make them unsuitable for the purpose. This paper is focused on the design and realization of a digital signal processing-based meter for power measurement in DVB-T systems that is capable of granting good accuracy, satisfying repeatability, reduced measurement time, and cost effectiveness. This paper deals with the digital signal processing algorithm to be implemented in the meter, paying attention to parametric power spectral density (PSD) estimators for their reduced memory requirement and potentially limited computational burden. In particular, a parametric estimation algorithm that is capable of assuring a fast measurement rate is implemented and made operative. The simulation and emulation stages are properly designed to regulate the most relevant parameters of the adopted PSD estimators according to the specific features of the signals involved; a number of experiments on actual DVB-T signals are conducted, the results of which are compared to those provided by competitive measurement solutions...|$|R

There are numerous investigations of interior noise control devoted to aircraft panels; however, practical realization is a potential challenge since physical boundary conditions are uncertain at best. In most prior studies, pinned or clamped boundary conditions were assumed; however, realistic panels likely display a range of boundary conditions between these two limits. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a challenge for control system designers, {{both in terms of}} the compensator implemented and the location of transducers required to achieve the desired control. The impact of model uncertainties, specifically uncertain boundaries, on the selection of transducer locations for structural acoustic control is considered herein.

Sec 8 overexpression significantly promotes oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation and myelin-like membrane formation in vitro; conversely, siRNA-mediated interference with Sec 8 expression inhibits this process, and anti-Sec 8 antibody induces a reduction in oligodendrocyte areas. In addition, Sec 8 colocalizes, coimmunoprecipitates and cofractionates with the major myelin protein OSP/Claudin 11 and with CASK in oligodendrocytes.

Muscle diseases, such as the muscular dystrophies, in which the force <b>transmission</b> <b>apparatus</b> is compromised, have devastating effects on muscle function and quality of life. Mechanical signals activate intracellular signaling to maintain function. ERK 2 {{has been shown to be}} quickly and strongly upregulated following stretch, leading to cell proliferation. Stretch has been shown to cause deformation of caveolae, invaginations of the plasma membrane that inhibit ERK signaling. This leads to the hypothesis that stretch induced deformation of caveolae may initiate mechanotransduction by activating ERK 2. Reducing caveolin- 3 expression via siRNA knockdown eradicated the stretch-induced effect on ERK 2 activation, indicating that caveolin is required for the stretch response. Stabilizing caveolae structure by temperature reduction or destabilizing caveolae by cholesterol depletion resulted in changes consistent with the hypothesis that proper caveolae structure plays an important role in inhibition of signaling molecules and that deformation mediates mechanotransduction, resulting in changes in activation of ERK 2.

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model of the genetic information storage and transmission system and investigate its properties. Breaking with tradition, whereas the genetic information storage and <b>transmission</b> <b>apparatus</b> is conventionally modelled as an engineering communication system with the DNA sequence as the input and the amino acid chain as the output, in this paper the genetic communication model is viewed as one between proteins. A connection {{in a series of}} protein communication systems is equivalent to a channel through time: the Channel of Evolution. We investigate the dynamics of the channel of evolution in both cases of a constant and time-variant point mutation rates. We prove that the distribution of amino acids converges geometrically to a specific distribution which matches nearly perfectly an estimate of the natural abundance of amino acids in Nature today. Moreover, based on the highly redundant structure of the encoded genetic message (i. e., DNA), we demonstrate that the role of introns in eukaryotic genomes is to maintain a fine balance between two competing yet complementary forces: stability and adaptability. The stability role is evaluated by showing that introns play the role of a decoy in absorbing mutations. We derive the optimal exon length distribution, which minimizes the probability of error in eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, to understand how Nature can physically achieve such a distribution, we propose a diffusive random walk model for exon generation throughout evolution. This model results in an alpha stable distribution, which is asymptotically equivalent to the optimal distribution. Experimental results on various eukaryotic organisms spanning the phylogenetic tree from unicellular organisms to plants to vertebrates show that both distributions accurately fit the biological data...|$|E

40|$|The actual keen about redox signal {{development}} at the plastid photosynthetic <b>apparatus,</b> <b>transmission</b> and the reply to the signal was highlighted by the contribution of three review article to this work. Pfannschmidt et al. 2008 summarizes {{short and long term}} acclimation responses (STR and LTR respectively) to redox signals of the Plastoquinone (PQ) pool and the involvement of putative phosphorylation cascades and thioredoxins as well as the influence of the redox state on primary target genes in plastids and nucleus. Further on experimental approaches for the generation of a defined redox state at the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain was discussed. Dietzel et al. 2008 reviews the different types of retrograde signals between plastids and nucleus as well as the complexity and interaction of the signaling cascades and networks and in Pfalz et al. 2012 the environmental influences on gene expression and recent findings within plastid redox signaling were discussed. For a detailed investigation of the adaption of plastid gene expression responding to plastid redox signals the gene expression machinery of chloroplasts itself was studied. An experimental approach was used for the generation of a defined redox signal in mustard cotyledons, the following isolation of its chloroplasts and further on the nucleotide binding sub-proteome using heparin-Sepharose (HS) (Steiner et al. 2009; Schröter et al. 2010). The characterization and comparison of mustard cotyledons acclimated to redox signal inducing Light-qualities with Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons was important for the integration of new findings within Sinapis alba into established models (Steiner et al. 2009). An effect on the transcriptional regulation of the two plastome-encoded genes psaAB and psbA was studied here concerning promoter recognition and specificity (Steiner et al. 2009). The impact of phosphorylation events on gene expression was surveyed and confirmed by determination of the phosphorylation state of the HS fractions, the endogenous kinase activity and the cooperative influence of kinase activity and thiol redox state on Chloroplast transcription (Steiner et al. 2009). HS proteins fractions contain a high degree of DNA and especially psaA and psbA binding proteins which were identified using mass spectrometry and Brassicales databases (Steiner et al. 2009; Schröter et al. 2010; Steiner et al. 2011). Special emphasis was on the analysis of the essential subunits of the plastid-encoded plastid RNA-polymerase (PEP) which was well to prepare by 2 dimensional (2 D) blue native (BN) gel electrophoresis (Schröter et al. 2010; Steiner et al. 2011). The degree of proteins involved in gene expression was strongly increased by the use of a second chromatographic step with Phosphocellulose (PC) additional to HS (Schröter et al. 2014). Visualization and identification of this nucleotide binding sub-proteome was the aim of the last publication included into this work giving access to a precise view on the gene expression related proteome of mustard plastids (Schröter et al. 2014). Drei review Artikel beleuchten das aktuelle Wissen über die Redoxsignalentwicklung im plastidären Photosyntheseapparat, die Signalübermittlung und –beantwotung. Pfannschmidt et al. 2008 fasst Kurzzeitund Langzeitantworten auf Redoxsignale des Plastochinonpools zusammen und darüberhinaus die Einbeziehung von Phosphorylierungskaskaden und Thioredoxinen sowie den Einfluss des Redoxstatus auf primäre Zielgene in Plastiden und dem Zellkern. Desweiteren wurden experimentelle Ansätze für die Erzeugung eines definierten Redoxstatus in der photosynthetischen Elektronentransportkette diskutiert. Dietzel et al. 2008 fasst die verschiedenen Typen retrograder Signale zwischen Plastiden und Zellkern zusammen sowie die Komplexität und Interaktion der Signalkaskaden und –netzwerke und in Pfalz et al. 2012 werden die Umwelteinflüsse auf die Genexpression und aktuelle Erkenntnisse über Redoxsignale diskutiert. Für eine detailierte Untersuchung der Genexpressionsadaption als Antwort auf plastidäre Redoxsignale wurde die Genexpressionsmaschinerie der Chloroplasten direkt studiert. Ein definiertes Redoxsignal wurde in Senfkeimlingen generiert, anschließend die Chloroplasten und schließlich die nukleotidbindenden Proteine mittels Chromatographie über Heparinsepharose (HS) isoliert (Steiner et al. 2009; Schröter et al. 2010). Der Vergleich und die Charakterisierung der Senfkeimlinge, die an das Redoxsignal induzierende Licht akklimatisiert waren, mit Arabidopsis thaliana Keimlingen war wichtig für die Integration neuer Erkenntnisse über Sinapis alba in etablierte Modelle (Steiner et al. 2009). Der Effekt auf die transkriptionale Regulierung der zwei plastomkodierten Gene psaAB und psbA wurde hinsichtlich Promotererkennung und –spezifität untersucht (Steiner et al. 2009). Die Auswirkung von Phosphorylierungen auf die Genexpression wurde, durch die Bestimmung des Phosphorylierungsgrades der HS Fraktionen, der endogene Kinaseaktivität und des kooperativen Einflusses der Kinaseaktivität und des Thiolredoxstatus auf die Chloroplastentranskription, untersucht (Steiner et al. 2009). HS Fraktionen besitzen einen hohen Grad an DNA- und speziell psaA- und psbA-bindenden Proteinen, die durch Massenspektrometrie und Analyse mit Brassicales-Datenbanken identifiziert werden können (Steiner et al. 2009; Schröter et al. 2010; Steiner et al. 2011). Der Schwerpunkt lag bei der Analyse der essentiellen Untereinheiten der plastidenkodierten plastidären RNAPolymerase (PEP), die gut durch 2 dimensionale (2 D) blue native (BN) Gelelektrophorese präpariert werden konnte (Schröter et al. 2010; Steiner et al. 2011). Der Anteil an Proteinen der Genexpression konnte durch eine zweite Chromatographie über Phosphocellulose (PC) zusätzlich zur HSChromatographie erzielt werden (Schröter et al. 2014). In der letzten Publikation dieser Arbeit geht es vorrangig um die Visualisierung und Identifizierung dieses nukleotidbindenden Teilproteoms, wodurch ein Zugang zu einem detaillierteren Einblick in das genexpressionsrelevante Proteom der Senfplastiden erzielt wurde (Schröter et al. 2014) ...|$|R
