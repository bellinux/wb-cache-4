5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton at the top of <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field. On <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E

50|$|Camping is {{not allowed}} at <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> area (which is {{normally}} called Baldy Point area). Camping is available at Quartz Mountain park campground, about 3 mi from <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> area, where there are 100 RV hookups plus a number of tent sites.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>climbing</b> {{fiber input}} to the {{cerebellum}} from the inferior olive {{is thought to}} act as a teacher whose activity controls the induction of motor learning. We designed training conditions that did not elicit instructive signals in <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fibers, but nevertheless induced robust and consistent motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex of rhesus monkeys. Our results indicate that instructive signals in <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fibers are not necessary for cerebellum-dependent learning. Instead, instructive signals carried by either <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fibers or Purkinje cell simple spikes may be sufficient to induce motor learning, with additive effects occurring when both instructive signals are present during training...|$|R
50|$|The 4x4 Cross edition, {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>Climbing,</b> {{features}} differently shaped {{front and rear}} lights and additional side cladding.

5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> to the finish. At {{the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed {{as they approached the}} line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|On the Côte de Peille, Contador {{attacked}} in the peloton. He quickly built an advantage, with Kiserlovski and Trofimov dropping {{back from the}} breakaway to assist him. They built a lead of around a minute, but Team Sky pulled the lead back and Contador's group was caught by {{the foot of the}} Col d'Èze, with only Tim Wellens (Lotto–Soudal) ahead. Romain Bardet attacked, but Contador chased him down. Contador himself attacked several times, with Sky's Sergio Henao and the Orica–GreenEDGE team chasing him down; Thomas appeared to be struggling. In the final part of <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> Contador got away, initially with Majka and then with Richie Porte. At the top of <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> they caught Wellens and had a 30-second advantage over the chasing group.|$|E
5|$|Some of the fauna {{reported}} on <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> {{to the summit}} include black bears, marmots, mule deer, pikas, and pocket gophers; there are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey and bighorn sheep {{are present in the}} area during the summer.|$|E
50|$|The peak can {{be reached}} on foot from two directions, {{starting}} <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> from <b>the</b> Valley of the Kings or near Deir el-Medina. <b>The</b> <b>climbing</b> takes an hour to {{an hour and a}} half and the same time to get back.|$|R

40|$|The {{inferior}} olivary nucleus provides {{one of the}} {{two main}} inputs to the cerebellum: <b>the</b> so-called <b>climbing</b> fibers. Activation of climbing fibers is generally believed to be related to timing of motor commands and/or motor learning. Climbing fiber spikes lead to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, overriding any other ongoing activity and silencing these cells for a brief period of time afterwards. Empirical evidence shows that <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber can transmit a short burst of spikes {{as a result of an}} olivary cell somatic spike, potentially increasing the information being transferred to <b>the</b> cerebellum per <b>climbing</b> fiber activation. Previously reported results from in vitro studies suggested that the information encoded in <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber burst is related to the occurrence of the spike relative to the ongoing sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation of the olivary cell, i. e. that the phase of the oscillation is reflected in the size of <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber burst. We used a detailed three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell to further investigate the possible factors determining the size of <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber burst. Our findings suggest that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited and that charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber burst. From our findings it follows that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a big effect on <b>the</b> <b>climbing</b> fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells...|$|R
5|$|The breakaway's {{lead was}} reduced to {{less than two minutes}} {{at the foot of the}} first climb. Howes {{attacked}} alone, with Madrazo following. On the descent, however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which had caught the remainder of the breakaway. On the flat section that followed <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After the descent, the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>climb</b> up or {{down from}} the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground. There {{have been a number}} of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it as dangerous as Striding Edge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} moment {{came in the}} approach to the Collada de Beixalis, the first climb of the day. Chris Froome hit a wooden barrier and then a wall, injuring his left shoulder and knee and his right foot. He was dropped from the lead group and, {{with the help of}} teammates, started a long chase back to the leading group. The first riders to attack were Romain Sicard (Europcar) and Darwin Atapuma (BMC); they were followed by seventeen other riders, including Fraile, the leader of the mountains classification. They led over the summit of <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> with Fraile the first over the summit to extend his lead in the classification. Froome regained contact with the main group on the descent from <b>the</b> <b>climb.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{quartet of}} riders made <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> in second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends into a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. <b>The</b> <b>climb</b> was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E

50|$|Pierre Rolland scored {{points on}} more climbs {{than any other}} rider; on a total of 18 <b>climbs,</b> {{compared}} to <b>the</b> King of the Mountains Nairo Quintana, who scored points on only 6 <b>climbs.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>climbs</b> that Quintana scored points on included all three of <b>the</b> Hors Category <b>climbs</b> that were at stage finishes - <b>the</b> <b>climbs</b> that offered <b>the</b> most amount of points. Of <b>the</b> <b>climbs</b> <b>the</b> riders placed in the points for, Quintana averaged 24.5 points per climb, compared to Rolland who averaged just 6.6 points. In total, Quintana won 97% of his points on Hors Category climbs, Chris Froome 79%, Rodriguez 92%, Riblon 88% and Nieve 86%, compared to Rolland who only won 48% of his points on HC climbs.|$|R
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up <b>the</b> <b>climb,</b> and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during <b>the</b> <b>climb.</b> Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E

5|$|Mountain {{climbing}} on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require {{two to three}} days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 to 13,000people attempt <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E
5|$|On {{the final}} climb, the Paterberg, Sagan rode away from Vanmarcke, who {{was caught by}} Cancellara {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>climb.</b> They rode in pursuit of Sagan, who had a 15-second lead at the summit. The chasing pair were unable to bring Sagan back and he rode to the finish to win his first Monument. Cancellara {{finished}} second, 25 seconds back, with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place. Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place, ahead of Luke Rowe (Sky), 49 seconds behind Sagan.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of <b>the</b> <b>climb</b> up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on <b>the</b> <b>climb.</b> Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E
