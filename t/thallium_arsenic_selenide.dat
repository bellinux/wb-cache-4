Almost every area of research has projected improvements in sensors, or even a promise for the emergence of some novel device technologies. For these applications major focuses of research are in the areas of nanoparticles and graphene. Although there are some near term applications with nanowires in photodetectors and other low light detectors, there are few papers on the growth mechanism and fabrication of nanowire-based devices.

40|$|Heavy {{metal halides}} and selenides have unique {{properties}} which make them excellent materials for chemical, biological and radiological sensors. Recently {{it has been}} shown that selenohalides are even better materials than halides or selenides for gamma-ray detection. These materials also meet the strong needs of a wide band imaging technology to cover ultra-violet (UV), midwave infrared wavelength (MWIR) to very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR) region for hyperspectral imager components such as etalon filters and acousto-optic tunable filters (AO). In fact AOTF based imagers based on these materials have some superiority than imagers based on liquid crystals, FTIR, Fabry-Perot, grating, etalon, electro-optic modulation, piezoelectric and several other concepts. For example, broadband spectral and imagers have problems of processing large amount of information during real-time observation. Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) imagers are being developed to fill the need of reducing processing time of data, low cost operation and key to achieving the goal of covering long-wave infrared (LWIR). At the present time spectral imaging systems are based on the use of diffraction gratings are typically used in a pushbroom or whiskbroom mode. They are mostly used in systems and acquire large amounts of hyperspectral data that is processed off-line later. In contrast, acousto-optic tunable filter spectral imagers require very little image processing, providing new strategies for object recognition and tracking. They are ideally suited for tactical situations requiring immediate real-time image processing. But the performance of these imagers depends on the quality and homogeneity of acousto-optic materials. In addition for many systems requirements are so demanding that crystals up to sizes of 10 cm length are desired. We have studied several selenides and halide crystals for laser and AO imagers for MWIR and LWIR wavelength regions. We have grown and fabricated crystals of several materials such as mercurous chloride, mercurous bromide, mercurous iodide, lead chloride lead bromide, lead iodide, <b>thallium</b> <b>arsenic</b> <b>selenide,</b> gallium selenide, zince sulfide zinc selenide and several crystals into devices. We have used both Bridgman and physical vapor transport (PVT) crystal growth methods. In the past have examined PVT growth numerically for conditions where the boundary of the enclosure is subjected to a nonlinear thermal profile. Since past few months we have been working on binary and ternary materials such as selenoiodides, doped zinc sulfides and mercurous chloro bromide and mercurous bromoiodides. In the doped and ternary materials thermal and solutal convection play extremely important role during the growth. Very commonly striations and banding is observed. Our experiments have indicated that even in highly purified source materials, homogeneity in 1 -g environment is very difficult. Some of our previous numerical studies have indicated that gravity level less than 10 - 4 (-g) helps in controlling the thermosolutal convection. We will discuss the ground based growth results of HgClxBr(1 -x) and ZnSe growth results for the mm thick to large cm size crystals. These results will be compared with our microgravity experiments performed with this class of materials. For both HgCl-HgBr and ZnS-ZnSe the lattice parameters of the mixtures obey Vagard's law in the studied composition range. The study demonstrates that properties are very anisotropic with crystal orientation, and performance achievement requires extremely careful fabrication to utilize highest figure of merit. In addition, some parameters such as crystal growth fabrication, processing time, resolution, field of view and efficiency will be described based on novel solid solution materials. It was predicted that very similar to the pure compounds solid solutions also have very large anisotropy, and very precise oriented and homogeneous bulk and thin film crystals is required to achieve maximum performance of laser or imagers. Some of the parameters controlling the homogeneity such as thermos-solutal convection driven forces can be controlled in microgravity environments to utilize the benefits of these unique materials...|$|E

The entire set of NMR spectra is simultaneously fitted with six distinct environments {{taking into account}} the effect of first and second neighbors on the position of the 77 Se resonance. The selenium chains are bound at each end to trivalent arsenic atoms, and the chain length distribution can be modeled with the Flory theory, which is well-known in polymer science and is used {{here for the first time}} to model the probability of finding each selenium environment in a <b>selenide</b> glass. No <b>arsenic</b> homopolar bond is detected in our experiments. ■ INTRODUCTION Chalcogenide glasses exhibit a wide range of physical properties such as infrared transparency, high refractive indices, and reversible amorphous-to-crystal transitions and can be easily shaped into optical devices. 1 − 6 Among them, the <b>arsenic</b> <b>selenide</b> glasses As x Se 1 −x are considered to be a promising family because glassy As 2 Se 3 is a good candidate for all-optical switching 7 or for use as a mid-infrared laser source; 8 in addition, <b>arsenic</b> <b>selenide</b> glasses can be used for optic fibers. 9 Recent studies also investigated the possibility of preparing these glasses using microwave heating. 10 Numerous attempts were made to draw a link between the changes in the physical properties of <b>arsenic</b> <b>selenide</b> and the evolution of its molecular structure as the arsenic content varies, both at room temperature 11, 12 and when the temperature is increased, 13 during aging of the glass, 14 or when irradiated with a laser. 15 To gain some insight into the <b>arsenic</b> <b>selenide</b> glass structures, recent studies relied on molecular dynamics 16 − 18 combined with anomalous X-ray scattering 19 or 77 Se solid-state NMR 20 − 23 to characterize the environments and connectivity of selenium and arsenic atoms. Many of these studies hint toward the existence of a small amount of As−As homopolar bond 12, 16 with tetravalent arsenic atoms linked to two arsenic and two selenium atoms. 19 Moreover, 77 Se NMR spectroscopy can quantify three distinct selenium environments (selenium atoms linked to two, one, or zero arsenic atoms) and shows that there is some disorder in the distribution of the lengths of the selenium chains that link arsenic atoms together, as opposed to what is inferred in the chain-crossing model (i. e., when the selenium chains are of similar lengths). 20, 23 Interestingly, it was suggested that the Flory model, 24 which describes the distribution of chain lengths in organic polymers, could be applied to inorganic polymers (mostly silicates) because the underlying chemical phenomena share striking similarities, especially for glasses with covalent bonds and no ionic species. 25 − 27 The Flory theory provides a very simple model for the probability, P(n), of finding a chain of length n, which is equal to np n− 1 (1 − p) 2, where p is the probability to form a linkage between two monomers and the average chain length is given by 1 + p/ 1 − p. Moreover, Flory distributions are characterized by a single parameter p and not two as is the case for Gaussian distributions (which may not correctly reproduce the chain length distributions for arsenic-rich glasses with short chain lengths) or three for skewed Gaussian distributions. Therefore, the Flory framework was applied here as a model for the distribution of chain lengths. 77 Se is a spin 1 / 2 nucleus with a 7. 63 % natural abundance, a gyromagnetic ratio equal to 19 % of γ(1 H), and a fairly large chemical shift range over 3000 ppm. 28, 29 However, as many diluted spin- 1 / 2, it usually features long longitudinal relaxation times around hundreds of seconds, which may affect the measured proportions of each selenium environment. 23 Usually, three selenium environments are distinguished depending upon the nature of the two atoms (arsenic or selenium) they are connected with. 20 However, as the 77 Se atoms are excessively sensitive to their environments, it is often observed that the chemical shifts of these broad lines vary with the composition of the sample, 20 precluding any simultaneous fitting of series of NMR spectra. Such an effect results from a dependence of th...|$|R

The content, transfer and accumulation of metals from soil to endemic species was evaluated in terms of Biological Concentration Factor (BCF), Total metal content of Zn, Ni, Cu, Ba, Tl, As,Pb, Co and Mn in soils varied between of 70 - 465 mg/kg, 17 - 190 mg/kg, 6 - 68 mg/kg, 20 - 1100 mg/kg, 98 - 154 mg/kg, 443 - 2000 mg/kg, 10 - 48 mg/kg, 8 - 217 mg/kg, 22 - 6410 mg/kg, respectively. In soil from Alshar site content of Tl (98 - 154 mg/kg) and As (443 - 2000 mg/kg), drastically exceeding the intervention value according to a New Dutch list. Mn has the highest bio-accumulation factor in comparison with other metals in both endemic species. BCF for other trace elements decreases in the order Pb> Cu> Ba> Zn> TL,> Ni> Tl> How to Violla Alsharica, and Cu> Zn> Ba> Ni> Pb> Tl> Co> As for Thymus alsharensis. The BCF values of Violla Alsharica, was highest for Pb (2, 98), Tl (1. 85) and Mn (10. 94), while Thymus alsharensis has higher BCF values for Zn (2. 93), Ba(2. 80), Cu(5. 68), Ni (2. 51) and Co (0. 73). Both endemic species have low bio-accumulation factor for As. Thumus alsharensis and Viola alsharica from Alshar site, had very high BCF values and could be useful for phytostabilization of soils contaminated with Cu, Zn, Tl, Ni and Pb...|$|R

5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and <b>arsenic,</b> <b>thallium</b> has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|R
