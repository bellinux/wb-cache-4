Thus, 22 elite football players have participated in this study. During this study in two stages, the blood sample collection was done before and after the general preparation phase, then before of the competition and the pre-seasonal matches. The collected data were studied by using the statisticalmethod of correlated t test at significance level of 0. 05 (α = 0. 05). Results showed that there was no significant reduction in amount of the musculoskeletal masses of football players before and after of the various trainings phases (general and specific exercise ahead of the matches); and, there was indeed a significant reduction in amount of the bodymass values after different <b>training</b> <b>phases</b> than before the general preparation phase.

40|$|OBJECTIVE There {{is limited}} {{research}} that describes periodisation models for football. Recent {{studies have shown}} the session-RPE method (Foster et al., 2001) to be a valid tool for quantifying training load (TL) (Foster et al., 2001; Impel-lizzerri et al, 2004). There have been no studies that have described the training loads undertaken by top level profes-sional rugby league players. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure and describe the training periodisation of a top level rugby league club during a season. METHODS Thirty eight professional players from the same club reported RPE (CR- 10) within 30 minutes of finishing each training session. The TL, monotony and strain were determined using previously described methods (Foster et al., 2001). Data was collected for each session during the distinct <b>training</b> <b>phases</b> of the season. ANOVA was used to de-termine any changes in TL during each of the <b>training</b> <b>phases.</b> RESULTS There were significant differences in the mean weekly TL and strain between the various phases of the season. The mean weekly TL’s and strain were greater in the preparation than the competition phases (P< 0. 01). The match loads during the competition phase did not significantly change.

30|$|Statistical {{analyses}} were performed using the statistical software SPSS statistics version 22 for Windows (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). p values[*]<[*] 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were performed to check for normal distributions. All parameters were normally distributed except body mass, fat mass, and FFM. To test for comparisons of subgroups, one-factorial analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with Scheffé post hoc tests (parametric) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (H-test) with Mann-Whitney U post hoc tests (non-parametric) were performed. When multiple non-parametric post hoc tests were applied, Bonferroni-adjusted alpha levels were applied.

However, the coupling between alterations of total energy expenditure (TEE), energy intake, and body composition during different seasonal <b>training</b> <b>phases</b> is unclear. So far, no systematic review has assessed fluctuations in TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition in endurance athletes across the training season. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (1) systematically analyze TEE, energy intake, and body composition in highly trained athletes of various endurance disciplines and of both sexes and (2) analyze fluctuations in these parameters across the training season. An electronic database search was conducted on the SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE (January 1990 - 31 January 2015) databases using a combination of relevant keywords. Two independent reviewers identified potentially relevant studies. Where a consensus was not reached, a third reviewer was consulted. Original research articles that examined TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition in 18 - 40 -year-old endurance athletes and reported the seasonal <b>training</b> <b>phases</b> of data assessment were included in the review. Articles were excluded if body composition was assessed by skinfold measurements, TEE was assessed by questionnaires, or data could not be split between the sexes. Two reviewers assessed the quality of studies independently. Data on subject characteristics, TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition were extracted from the included studies. Subjects were categorized according to their sex and endurance discipline and each study allocated a weight within categories based on the number of subjects assessed. Extracted data were used to calculate weighted means and standard deviations for parameters of TEE, energy intake, and/or body composition. From 3589 citations, 321 articles were identified as potentially relevant, with 82 meeting all of the inclusion criteria. TEE of endurance athletes was significantly higher during the competition phase than during the preparation phase (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and significantly higher than energy intake in both phases (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). During the competition phase, both body mass and fat-free mass were significantly higher compared to other seasonal <b>training</b> <b>phases</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).
