5|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{designated}} as a provincial highway in the 1960s, it was a paved two lane route.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolution, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} artery {{over which the}} British and the colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon {{to the top of}} a hill and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston Post Road) until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1800s, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> macadamized, and {{gradually}} came to be known as the Niagara Stone Road as the surrounding swampland was drained and farmed.|$|E
5000|$|North-east of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as a non primary route, while south-west of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified as}} a primary route. In both instances, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> operated by Carmarthenshire County Council.|$|R
50|$|Officially <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{designated}} as Aichi Prefectural Route 522. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> designated {{for motor vehicles}} only (Jidōsha Senyō Dōro) (motor vehicles must have a displacement of at least 125 cc), and the design standard of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> similar to national expressways.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} the European route E265. The {{total length}} of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 47,2 km.|$|R
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{inundated}} with floods damaging the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 {{was the center}} point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a road up Whiteface Mountain was first conceived {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries by Marcellus Leonard, an entrepreneur from Saranac Lake. The plans for the highway {{began to take shape}} in the 1920s when the land for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> given by its owner to the state of New York on the condition that it would be named after America's Great War veterans. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> later renamed to honor veterans from all wars. Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the dedication for the highway in 1929.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} {{as part of}} Pentonville, a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{famous for}} <b>the</b> antique and century old Spanish houses and Balete trees that line <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also notable for the {{haunting}} legends that it had.|$|R
50|$|In peak periods, {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>are</b> clogged with traffic, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> a {{reference}} point on Perth radio traffic reports.|$|R
50|$|D33 connects Šibenik to Drniš and Knin. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has {{junctions}} {{to major}} state roads, namely D8 in Šibenik, connecting to Biograd na Moru and Trogir, and D1 state road in Knin, {{which in turn}} connects to Sinj {{to the south and}} to Gračac to the north. The southern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> found in Vidici interchange near Šibenik. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also connected to A1 motorway in Šibenik interchange. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 73.3 km long. The northern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> at Strmica border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> proceeds to Drvar.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} designed to connect local industrial communities together in addition to bypassing London, and was constructed in the 1920s and '30s. It received significant upgrades after the Second World War, and was at one point planned to be upgraded to motorway {{as part of the}} controversial and ultimately cancelled London Ringways scheme in the late 1960s. In the early 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> extended to bypass Barking and meet the A13 north of Woolwich.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{repaired}} in 2005 following heavy rainfall, but <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> not reopened , due to {{objections from}} Angeles National Forest officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{of these}} two Indian trails later became the Chicago Road. Father Gabriel Richard, the first priest {{to serve in the}} U.S. House of Representatives, petitioned Congress to fund a highway between Detroit and Chicago in March 1824. A year later, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> established in federal law, and it was surveyed by the end of 1825. Construction started in 1829, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> finished across Michigan in 1833. The northern Indian trail was established as an unnamed territorial road in 1829.|$|E
50|$|North of its {{crossing}} point with Highway 7, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> known as Upper Dwyer Hill Road. South of its junction with Kinburn Sideroad, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> numbered as Ottawa Road #3. In total, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> about 70 km long, edging out both the Queensway and Bank Street {{for the title}} of longest <b>road</b> in <b>the</b> city.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first part}} of the E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{concurrent}} with <b>the</b> A10 was opened on December 6th 1989. The {{first part of}} the E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> concurrent with <b>the</b> A2 was opened in May 1938. The {{first part of the}} E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> concurrent with <b>the</b> A12 was opened on November 25th 1939.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{vital for}} {{servicing}} communities on the Dampier Peninsula {{and is also}} a popular tourist attraction. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> maintained by <b>the</b> Shire of Broome.|$|R
5|$|Within Almonte, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} Ottawa Street and Main Street; east of there it became March Road.|$|E
5|$|Within Gananoque, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} Stone Street North. An {{interchange}} with Highway401 lay {{just north of}} the town, north of which the former highway travelled through farmland and forests.|$|E
5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{also named}} Mjosundvegen (Mjosund <b>Road)</b> after <b>the</b> strait that it runs {{parallel}} to along its northern stretch. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> subject to landslides in places.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} being further upgraded to full Motorway standard with three new intersections being built. Upon completion <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{planned to be}} named Motorway A121.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> notable as it runs {{alongside}} Hadrian's Wall {{for much}} of its length, and long stretches of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>are</b> built on <b>the</b> foundations of the wall.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1912, the Ohio section {{of what is}} now US223 was shown on maps as SR54, however <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> not signed with the number at the time. The Michigan section carried two numbers when the signs were erected by July 1, 1919. The segment from Somerset to Adrian was M-80, and the {{remainder}} in Michigan was M-34. Ohio signed its highways, including SR54, by July 1923.|$|E
5|$|Between Webster and Provost Avenues, East 233rd Street {{was once}} part of NY22, which {{previously}} continued into Manhattan. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{also part of the}} alignment for the proposed City Line Expressway.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, {{what is now}} Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at {{a fork in the}} road. At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> R321 <b>road</b> <b>is</b> a {{regional}} <b>road</b> in central County Mayo in Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> discontinuous and it connects <b>the</b> N58 <b>road</b> at Ballylahan to <b>the</b> N5 <b>road</b> near Bohola, {{and after a}} 950m hiatus, it leaves the N5 at Toocananagh and joins the R320 in Kiltimagh. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 11.5 km long.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> officially {{designated}} as a bypass for National Route 119 (Utsunomiya Interchange to Nikkō Interchange) and National Route 120 (Nikkō Interchange to Kiyotaki Interchange). <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> designated for motor vehicles only (Jidōsha Senyō Dōro) (motor vehicles must have a displacement of at least 125 cc).
