5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road.

The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E

5|$|Ideas for Dishonored 2 began while {{developing}} the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned {{the decision to}} create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, only a child in Dishonored, was first proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the new fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented {{over the course of}} one year. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>itself</b> was based on southern European countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851.|$|E
