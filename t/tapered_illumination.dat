40|$|This paper {{analyses}} scalar scattering and diffraction from ensembles of coaxial axi-symmetric {{closed or}} open screens that are arbitrarily shaped. Plane wave and complex point source excitations are {{examined in the}} frequency domain by the semi-analytic Method of Regularisation. The Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation is reduced analytically to a well-conditioned coupled infinite system of algebraic equations. This system is then effectively solved by a truncation method with any pre-specified accuracy, strictly depending on the truncation number. Applications related to plane wave excitation include accurate studies of coupled cavity resonators, of open cavities with insertions and of configurations where targets lie in the shadow zone. Our investigation employing beam-like excitation focuses on the accurate analysis of a front-fed parabolic reflector antenna. The <b>tapered</b> <b>illumination</b> is simulated by a complex-point source, supported by a back plate. The maximum permissible extent of the supporting back plate that does not unduly compromise {{the operation of the}} reflector antenna is determined.

The methods may be applied to various geometrical and electrical parameters for reflector antennas (D/?, � 500, p = F/D � 0. 1) but they have been mainly used to perform analysis of the giant cylindrical reflector antenna (Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, MOST) of the University of Sydney, which is located in Australia near Canberra.

40|$|Abstract- In {{the design}} of Reflector antenna systems, the control of sidelobes caused from {{spillover}} of the primary pattern presents a major design challenge. The design of the illumination pattern of the reflector system is key to designing a reflector system that optimizes gain while minimizing {{the level of the}} sidelobes. The reduction of spillover sidelobes requires the use of large aperture feeds that provide a highly <b>tapered</b> <b>illumination</b> pattern. One of the traditional methods for accomplishing this design is the use of large aperture conical or corrugated horns for the feed. These designs are extremely effective for single band feeds but present problems when needed to operate over an extended frequency band. The approach presented in this paper attempts to illustrate a broadband solution to the feed pattern shaping design. The use of a doubly shaped lens placed at the aperture of a multi-band feed is investigated. The investigation is performed on a parabolic antenna system. The first surface of the lens transforms the radiation pattern into a plain wave exiting the feed aperture. The second surface then refocuses the radiation to {{the focal point of the}} reflector’s parabolic surface. This approach allows greater control of the primary pattern and allows the illumination pattern to be optimized for the antenna system design...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{derivation}} and physical interpretation of a uniform high-frequency representation of the Green's function for a large planar rectangular phased array of dipoles with weakly varying excitation. Thereby, our earlier published results, valid for equiamplitude excitation, and those for <b>tapered</b> <b>illumination</b> in one dimension are extended to tapering along both dimensions, including dipole amplitudes tending to zero at the edges. As previously, the field obtained by direct summation over the contributions from the individual radiators is restructured into a double spectral integral whose high-frequency asymptotic reduction yields a series of propagating and evanescent Floquet waves (FWs) together with corresponding FW-modulated diffracted fields, which arise from FW scattering at the array edges and vertexes. To accommodate the weak amplitude tapering, new generalized periodicity-modulated edge and vertex "slope" transition functions are introduced, accompanied by a systematic procedure for their numerical evaluation. Special attention {{is given to the}} analysis and physical interpretation of the complex vertex diffracted ray fields. A sample calculation is included to demonstrate the accuracy of the asymptotic algorithm. The resulting array Green's function forms the basic building block for the full-wave analysis of planar weakly amplitude-tapered phased array antennas, and for the description of electromagnetic radiation and scattering from weakly amplitude-tapered rectangular periodic structures. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The ESA Planck {{satellite}} {{has begun}} studying the anisotropies {{of the cosmic}} microwave background radiation over the whole sky with unprecedented sensitivity and high angular resolution. The High Frequency Instrument, HFI, on Planck is observing simultaneously in six bands in the range 100 GHz to 857 GHz. The inclusion of non-CMB bands allows for robust removal of foreground sources from the data. This paper is concerned with the design, modeling and predicted performances of the two highest frequency channels centered on 545 GHz and 857 GHz, which use specialized multi-mode feedhorns, and are dedicated to observing these foregrounds. Multi-mode systems have the advantage of increasing the throughput, and thus sensitivity, of the detection assembly when diffraction limited resolution is not required. The horns are configured in a back-to-back setup which transmits the signal through filters to a detector horn. The modeling of the broadband beam patterns on the sky is shown to require careful analysis. Simulations of the complex interactions of the horns is computationally challenging when the detector horn in the relay system is included. The paper describes the approach to modeling these high frequency channels and discusses how the optical requirements on the horn designs are met in terms of spillover, edge <b>taper,</b> <b>illumination</b> of the telescope aperture and beam patterns on the sky...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} {{is presented}} of three techniques {{used for the}} efficient computation of fields diffracted by a subreflector that has been shaped by geometrical optics synthesis. It is found that these techniques, {{which are based on}} the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), produce errors in the computed fields that are specific to shaped reflectors. These errors are examined for a reflector system shaped to produce maximum gain from a <b>tapered</b> feed <b>illumination.</b> The discrepancies are directly related to the caustic being located near an observation point of the GTD calculations. The errors found are localized, and they increase in magnitude as the caustic approaches the main reflector. In a general offset geometry, the location of the caustic may be located arbitrarily close to the main reflector given a prescribed output aperture distribution. For the specific case considered here-the common situation of shaping to produce maximum gain-the caustic is located {{near the edge of the}} main reflector and on the reflection shadow boundary. A local correction is derived which creates a uniform solution through the caustic and across the reflection shadow boundary. Away from this point the calculation receeds to the standard GTD solution...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the works}} of Ruze (1966) and Vu (1969), a novel {{mathematical}} model has been developed to determine efficiently the average power pattern degradations caused by random surface errors. In this model, both nonuniform root mean square (rms) surface errors and nonuniform illumination functions are employed. In addition, the model incorporates the dependence on F/D {{in the construction of}} the solution. The mathematical foundation of the model rests on the assumption that in each prescribed annular region of the antenna, the geometrical rms surface value is known. It is shown that closed-form expressions can then be derived, which result in a very efficient computational method for the average power pattern. Detailed parametric studies are performed with these expressions to determine the effects of different random errors and <b>illumination</b> <b>tapers</b> on parameters such as gain loss and sidelobe levels. The results clearly demonstrate that as sidelobe levels decrease, their dependence on the surface rms/wavelength becomes much stronger and, for a specified tolerance level, a considerably smaller rms/wavelength is required to maintain the low sidelobes within the required bounds...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of a radar antenna is to provide spatial filtering that maximizes the radar's sensitivity in the desired sUIveillance direction while suppressing interference signals that enter the radar from other directions. This article describes a UHFradar antennasystemwith exceptional interference-rejectioncapabilities that are achieved through a combination of precision passive beamforming in the azimuth plane, and active, digital adaptive nulling in elevation. The antenna is composed of 14 stacked rows; each row contains a stripline, low-sidelobe, passive corporate-feed network. For signal reception, a separate receiver and analog-to-digital converter are used at each row output. The system adaptively combines the digitized rowsignals to form an elevationpatternwithnulls at the elevation angles ofinterference sources. The antenna systemis part ofan advanced air surveillance radar that Lincoln Laboratory is developing for the Navy. This article describes the design of the antenna system and presents performance analyses and measured results. Modern radars use a variety of electronic counter-countermeasures to suppress both inadvertent interference and intentional jamming. When the desired target and the interferencesource are notatthesamelocation, a radar {{can take advantage of the}} separation to suppress the interference without suppressing the target return. This selective suppression canbe achieved by a radar antenna with a radiation pattern that provides maximum gain in the direction ofthe targetand a verylowresponse in the interference direction. There are several techniques for controlling the shape of an antenna radiation pattern. Passive, fIxed <b>tapering</b> ofthe aperture <b>illumination</b> can produce a pattern with uniformly low sidelobes outside the direction of the main beam. A pattern of this type is useful for suppressing both interference and clutter. A key parameter in low-sidelobe design is the radiation-pattern sidelobe level expressed in relation to isotropic gain, which is the gain of a lossless antenna that radiates uniformly in all directions.

40|$|Resonant edge-slot (slotted-waveguide) array antennas {{can now be}} {{designed}} very accurately following a modern computational approach like that followed for some other microwave components. This modern approach {{makes it possible to}} design superior antennas at lower cost than was previously possible. Heretofore, the physical and engineering knowledge of resonant edge-slot array antennas had remained immature since they were introduced during World War II. This is because despite their mechanical simplicity, high reliability, and potential for operation with high efficiency, the electromagnetic behavior of resonant edge-slot antennas is very complex. Because engineering design formulas and curves for such antennas are not available in the open literature, designers have been forced to implement iterative processes of fabricating and testing multiple prototypes to derive design databases, each unique for a specific combination of operating frequency and set of waveguide tube dimensions. The expensive, time-consuming nature of these processes has inhibited the use of resonant edge-slot antennas. The present modern approach reduces costs by making it unnecessary to build and test multiple prototypes. As an additional benefit, this approach affords a capability to design an array of slots having different dimensions to <b>taper</b> the antenna <b>illumination</b> to reduce the amplitudes of unwanted side lobes. The heart of the modern approach is the use of the latest commercially available microwave-design software, which implements finite-element models of electromagnetic fields in and around waveguides, antenna elements, and similar components. Instead of building and testing prototypes, one builds a database and constructs design curves from the results of computational simulations for sets of design parameters.
