40|$|Variations in ionospheric {{plasma density}} can cause large {{amplitude}} and phase {{changes in the}} radio waves passing through this region. Ionospheric weather can have detrimental effects on several communication systems, including radars, navigation systems such as the Global Positioning Sytem (GPS), and high-frequency communications. As a result, creating models of the ionospheric density is of paramount interest to scientists {{working in the field}} of satellite communication. Numerous empirical and theoretical models have been developed to study the upper atmosphere climatology and weather. Multiple measurements of plasma density over a region are of marked importance while creating these models. The lack of spatially distributed observations in the upper atmosphere is currently a major limitation in space weather research. A constellation of CubeSat platforms would be ideal to take such distributed measurements. The use of miniaturized instruments that can be accommodated on small satellites, such as CubeSats, would be key <b>to</b> <b>acheiving</b> these science goals for space weather. The accepted instrumentation techniques for measuring the electron density are the Langmuir probes and the Plasma Impedance Probe (PIP). While Langmuir probes are able to provide higher resolution measurements of relative electron density, the Plasma Impedance Probes provide absolute electron density measurements irrespective of spacecraft charging. The central goal of this dissertation is to develop an integrated architecture for the PIP that will enable space weather research from CubeSat platforms. The proposed PIP chip integrates all of the major analog and mixed-signal components needed to perform swept-frequency impedance measurements. The design 2 ̆ 7 s primary innovation is the integration of matched Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) on a single chip for sampling the probes current and voltage signals. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed by an off-chip Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to compute the probes impedance. This provides a robust solution for determining the plasma impedance accurately. The major analog errors and parametric variations affecting the PIP instrument and its effect on the accuracy and precision of the impedance measurement are also studied. The system clock is optimized {{in order to have a}} high performance ADC. In this research, an alternative clock generation scheme using C-elements is described to reduce the timing jitter and reference spurs in phase locked loops. While the jitter performance and reference spur reduction is comparable with prior state-of-the-art work, the proposed Phase Locked Loop (PLL) consumes less power with smaller area than previous designs...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is divided into}} two studies. Study 1 considers the proposition that where the challenging behaviours of learning disabled people are sensitive to social reinforcement, the responses of unit staff may be counter-habilitative. This was investigated using a questionnaire-based self-report study involving 43 unit staff. The questionnaires covered staff emotional reactions to, attributions for and responses to challenging behaviours. In addition key aspects of the staff sub-culture were considered. Results confirmed the possible counter-habilitative nature of staff responses. These responses appeared to be influenced by both contingency effects related to high levels of stress and counter -habilitative beliefs within staff sub-cultures. Study 2 had two aims. First, to gather qualitative data with regard to both contingency and sub-culture effects. Secondly, to evaluate a training package designed to ameliorate counter-habilitative influences upon staff responses. The qualitative data gathered was strongly suggestive of an interaction between contingency and culture effects, reinforced by aspects of the wider service culture. Key issues appeared to be high levels of stress related to challenging behaviours, highly counter-habilitative beliefs in which staff feel that they have to 'deal with anything' and a perceived lack of support from the wider service itself For example, only a minority of staff had access to a consistent debriefing procedure. The training package proved to be largely ineffective in changing key counter-habilitative beliefs and responses. It is argued that future intervention strategies and research may need to consider wider service issues if habilitative changes are <b>to</b> be <b>acheived.</b> The implications of these findings for clinical psychologists working with learning disability services are also discussed.

40|$|Three {{traits of}} dual purpose sheep {{such as the}} New Zealand Romney are of {{paramount}} importance in contributing directly to income. These are reproductive ability and wool production of the ewe flock and {{the growth rate of}} the lamb produced. Investigations of methods of genetic improvement of these traits is important, since such improvement is more permanent than that caused by environmental modification or the use of hormones. Improvement of productive traits through genetic means may be brought about (1) by exploiting the differences between groups of animals which have been genetically distinct for some time (breeds, strains, studs or inbred lines) or (2) by exploiting the difference between individual animals within a flock, The first method involves crossbreeding, which may change production through the introduction of superior genes or through complex interactions between genes (heterosis and epistasis). Rae (1952) reviewed the field of crossbreeding and looked at grading up existing breeds, combining crossbreeding with selection to form new breeds and exploiting hybrid vigour (heterosis). With the N. Z. Romney this practice is in fact being carried out by some farmers who are crossing with the Cheviot (to obtain an animal for a harsh environment) or Border Leicester (for a more favourable environment). In some cases these crossbred animals so produced have been interbred and selected to form the two new breeds Perendale and Coopworth respectively. For many reasons many farmers prefer not to cross their flocks with animals of another breed and it is then necessary to use the second method, i. e. to select within the farmers flock, if any genetic improvement is <b>to</b> be <b>acheived.</b> This study is aimed at studying factors of importance to within flock selection...|$|R
