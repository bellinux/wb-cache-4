The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in C++, Object Pascal, Java, C# and several other languages. Computer scientists such as Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, and James Gosling, creator of Java, have acknowledged Simula as a major influence.|$|E
40|$|Offsetting Queer Literary Labor” {{asks how}} LGBTQ+ people and other feminists navigated late twentieth-century changes in print {{technology}} in the period from roughly 1965 - 1990, a period during which typesetting was first computerized and then all but abandoned {{as part of the}} pre-print process. I do this by way of an encounter with the writings of Marxist-feminist poet Karen Brodine. The labor relations that surround the <b>typesetting</b> <b>computer</b> are {{part and parcel of the}} revolutionary working-class and queer socialist feminism that Brodine elaborates across her writing and that she worked for tirelessly in her life. Through a reading of her poetry, journals, and political activities, I argue that late-twentieth century US gender and sexual categories, as well as novel forms of queer intimacy, were forged through the material relations of print-related wage work. Rather than claiming to queer these texts or this history, this article argues that the concrete forms of feminized labor that attend literary technologies have been and continue to be the basis for the category of “LGBT literature. ...|$|E

The disadvantage of ASCII schemes is that letter case is meaningful, so that transliterated names may not be capitalized.|$|R
50|$|In White’s day, the {{newspaper}} was printed by the hot lead method. Type {{was set on}} a linotype using molten lead or by hand from cases full of individual letters. Illustrations for ads were poured using mats as molds. This continued for over fifty years, {{with the addition of}} an engraver for photographs, until Dick David bought electronic type-setting equipment that allowed {{the newspaper}} to be printed by the offset method. The equipment was updated, and a darkroom installed, carrying the newspaper into the 1980s when the Ajo Copper News finally entered the era of <b>typesetting</b> on <b>computers.</b> Some of the old type cases and a proof press can be seen at the Ajo Historical Society Museum.|$|R

Opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures.|$|R
